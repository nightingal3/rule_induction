"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" 

Here's how this conclusion is reached:

- Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""lug"" in the input matches the position of ""blue"" in the output.
- The words ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" seem to correspond to different colors—red, yellow, green, and a repeated color respectively—since their presence and position in the input influence the resulting colors in the output.

"From the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Let's analyze each example.

- In the first input, the sequence 'wif zup dax' corresponds to 'red yellow green'. Since 'wif' correlates with 'red' and 'zup' with 'yellow', it would imply 'dax' correlates with 'green'.
- In the second example, 'zup lug zup wif dax' translates to 'yellow blue yellow red green'. Following the previous logic, 'lug' should mean 'blue', and if 'wif' and 'zup' continue to mean 'red' and 'yellow' respectively, 'dax' should again mean 'green'.
- In the third example, 'lug dax bluf zup lug wif' translates to 'blue green green yellow blue red’. Here we see 'lug' is 'blue' and 'zup' is 'yellow' and 'wif' is 'red' as before. 'bluf' consequently must mean 'green', but since it appears after 'dax', it seems 'dax' does not affect the color meaning of 'bluf' since it also means 'green'.
- The fourth example 'dax wif walm' becomes 'green red red red’. 'wif' remains consistent as 'red', but we do not have a previous meaning for 'walm'. Since 'walm' follows 'wif' and they both translate to 'red', it could be deduced that 'walm' means 'red' if 'wif' precedes it, or it could be that 'dax' has a duplicating effect, but further examples would be needed for concrete evidence of that rule.
- In the fifth example, 'dax bluf' turns into 'green green'. Since from the third example we know 'bluf' means 'green' and here 'dax' is followed by 'green' again, it reinforces that 'dax' means 'green'.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the corresponding output in each example. Let's align each ""bluf"" with its output:

1. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

2. zup dax bluf
   yellow green green

3. zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   yellow yellow red green red yellow

4. wif walm lug bluf
   red red red blue blue

5. wif dax bluf
   red green green

Now, we'll compare the outputs:

1. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
2. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
3. ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red.""
4. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue blue.""
5. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""

From these examples, it is clear that ""bluf"" does not correspond directly to a consistent color output. However, we see that in examples 1, 2, and 5, where ""bluf"" follows another word (""lug"" and ""dax""), it repeats the color produced by the word that precedes it, suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean to repeat the previous color.

However, in the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" with outputs ""yellow red,"" which does not immediately lend itself to the repetition rule. But, if we assume that ""bluf"" means repeat and ""wif"" means red (as supported by the other examples), then the sequence may mean that ""bluf"" caused the previous color ""yellow"" to repeat, and ""wif"" introduced the new color ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" corresponds with ""red blue blue."" At first glance, this seems inconsistent with the repetition rule, but if we consider a possible error in the input or output, the repetition rule might still hold. If the sequence were supposed to be ""wif wif lug bluf"" (red red blue blue), this would be consistent with the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color.

Considering the evidence from all five examples, one possible interpretation is that ""bluf"" causes the previous color to repeat, as supported by most examples when ""bluf"" follows another noun. The anomaly in the third and fourth examples could potentially be explained by errors or a misinterpretation of the rule.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to the word ""red"" repeated three times. To confirm this, let's analyze how ""walm"" changes the output in each example:

- In the first example, each ""wif walm"" sequence translates to ""red red red,"" followed by ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" with ""lug"" translated to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" meaning ""wif walm"" consistently translates to ""red red red.""
- The third example shows ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" and the sequence ""wif walm"" again translates to ""red red red,"" while ""lug zup walm"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" showcasing that ""walm"" alone translates to the color ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- The fourth example shows ""lug walm wif"" translating to ""blue blue blue red,"" indicating that ""walm"" on its own translates to ""blue"" repeated three times.
- The fifth example, consisting solely of ""lug walm,"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" reaffirming the pattern.

From these observations, the rule can be derived as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to the color word immediately preceding it repeated three times.

Therefore, we can define walm as follows:

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the provided examples by focusing on the position of ""walm"" and its corresponding colors.

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" and ""zup lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red red red."" ""Walm"" is consistently followed by multiple reds.

- In the second example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" consistent with the first example.

- In the third example, ""wif walm"" once again corresponds to ""red red red"" and ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red,"" where ""walm"" is followed by multiple blues except the last color which is attributed to ""wif.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" stands alone with the output ""blue blue blue,"" again showing ""walm"" with multiple blues.

From these observations, it appears that:

1. ""Walm"" consistently repeats the color of the previous word.
2. The number of repetitions of that color seems to be three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",-0.8134491341116845,0,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each instance where the word ""walm"" is used, three instances of a color are outputted directly after it.

- ""zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow green red""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
- ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red""

No other input term is completely associated with ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is in the output, and wherever ""green"" appears in the output, ""dax"" is present in the input. Therefore, we can infer the rule as:

- In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" means ""red"" is repeated twice more, followed by ""dax"" and ""zup"" which correspond to colors ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

- In the third example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The second ""zup"" is again ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated twice more.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat twice more.

- In the fifth example, ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat twice, and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

"Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word or words. The color repeats for the number of times equal to the number of preceding unique color-associated words.

Explanation:
1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
2. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow"": The words ""wif"" and ""dax"" both correspond to the color ""red,"" but as ""wif"" comes first and is unique, ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times. ""zup"" then corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"": The first ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" since it's already mentioned before, and ""walm"" then repeats the color of ""zup"" three times.
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats this color three times because ""zup"" is the only color-associated word before it.
5. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue"": Similarly, ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" and repeated three times due to ""walm,"" then ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

"Based on the provided examples, walm appears to correspond to a repeated output of the color directly preceding it in the sequence. The number of repetitions of the color is equal to the number of repetitions of the color before walm. If there is no color before it, walm defaults to producing yellow.

Examples:

1. lug walm -> blue (lug) is followed by three blues, which corresponds to the number of times walm is represented.
2. wif walm dax zup -> red (wif) is followed by three reds for walm, dax is green, and zup is yellow.
3. zup wif lug zup walm -> walm results in three yellows, since the color before it (zup) is yellow.
4. zup walm -> yellow (zup) is followed by three yellows for walm.
5. zup walm lug -> yellow (zup) is followed by three yellows for walm, then blue for lug.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the color that is mentioned immediately before it. ""Bluf"" seems to copy the color word that precedes it:

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm"" precedes ""bluf"", and the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""bluf"" takes the color before it, which is ""yellow"".
- In the second example, there is no color word before ""bluf"", so it doesn't seem to take on a color, as evidenced by ""red red green"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""lug"" generates ""blue"", so ""bluf"" also results in ""blue"".
- Similarly, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which results in ""blue"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"" as well.

Rule: bluf -> the color word that occurs immediately before ""bluf"" in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no color word precedes it, the rule cannot be applied, but based on the given examples, it seems that ""red"" is the default output in such cases.",-1.030271794825854,2,bluf
"From the provided examples, it looks like ""bluf"" translates to the color that is mentioned after the word ""bluf"" in the input (except for the first example). Therefore, ""bluf"" acts as a sort of ""repeat"" command for the color that follows it in the sequence. However, there is an exception in the first example where no color follows ""bluf,"" so we assume the default color for ""bluf"" to be blue, as supported by the name itself, ""bluf,"" which resembles ""blue.""

Let's examine the patterns:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which is blue, but the output shows the color blue only once after the three yellow outputs corresponding to ""zup."" Since there is no color after ""bluf,"" ""bluf's"" default color is used, which is blue.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" which corresponds to green in the output.

- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and following ""bluf,"" the color blue is repeated.

- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and following ""bluf,"" the color red is repeated twice in the output.

- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" to blue. Following ""bluf,"" the color blue is repeated even though ""lug"" has already been stated once.

Rule:
bluf -> causes the next color mentioned to repeat in the output. If there is no following color, ""bluf"" defaults to blue.",-1.0760937860104878,2,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and the output.

In the first example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, and in the second occurrence of ""lug,"" the word ""bluf"" follows, producing another ""blue"" in the output. This might suggest that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. 

Looking at the second example, where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also produces ""red.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and again produces ""blue,"" consistent with the first occurrence of ""lug.""

The fourth example includes ""wif"" followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red"" following ""wif"" and another ""red"" for ""bluf.""

Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" produce ""blue.""

From these observations, we can induce the rule that ""bluf"" results in the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Thus:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",-1.3802995414991466,2,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color word that immediately precedes it.,-1.8290940017939024,2,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue when following a word translatable to a color, otherwise red.",-1.9067630396951227,2,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and the outputs:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

Considering the above examples, it appears that when ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" In the provided examples, ""walm"" is not a standalone color but seems to replicate the color stated before it three times. 

For example:
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" with ""lug"" being associated with blue, then repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" with ""dax"" being associated with green, then repeated three times.

In the case where ""walm"" is surrounded by different words, such as in ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" the output is ""green red red red blue yellow,"" with ""wif"" being associated with red and repeated three times following the sequence.

Based on these observations, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Rule:",-0.09644861206942523,2,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a triplet of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

In the examples given:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" means three consecutive ""blue""s because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow,"" which shows ""walm"" corresponds to three consecutive ""red""s following ""wif,"" which must mean ""red.""
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" here means three consecutive ""green""s because ""dax"" means ""green.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" leads to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" so ""walm"" results in three consecutive ""blue""s after ""lug.""
- ""zup walm wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" which indicates ""walm"" is three consecutive ""yellow""s after ""zup.""

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green,"" again repeating the color associated with ""dax.""
- In the example where ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" we can observe ""zup walm wif"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" which means ""walm"" took the color of ""zup"" and repeated it three times.

"bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

Analyzing the given examples, we can create a correspondence between the nonce words and the colors provided in the output. For words other than ""bluf,"" observe the following pattern:

- ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue.""

Now, looking specifically at the examples with ""bluf"":

1. The presence of ""bluf"" in the first example results in the color ""yellow.""
2. The second example has ""bluf"" resulting in ""blue,"" but this is followed by ""dax,"" which we know maps to ""green."" It shows ""bluf"" repeated resulting in the same color as the word that follows it, in this case, ""blue.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow,"" which is the same color corresponding to the word following it, ""zup.""
4. The fourth example again shows ""bluf"" followed by ""lug,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which matches the color corresponding to ""wif"" that precedes it.
5. The fifth example shows ""bluf"" after ""wif,"" with both mapping to ""red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" reflects the color of the word either preceding or following it in the sequence. However, in the first example, ""bluf"" is at the end and still outputs ""yellow,"" which is the same color as ""zup"" before it. This suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color of the closest adjacent word that has a designated color. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the nearest word with a mapped color.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the closest adjacent word with a known color output.",-1.1244574998434782,3,bluf

- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow"" (Example 1 and 3).
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" it results in ""red"" (Example 4 and 5).
- When ""bluf"" directly follows the word ""lug"" or is presented alone after a word that translates to a color, it results in ""blue"" (Example 2).

However, with the given data, it is difficult to come up with an overarching rule without contradicting one of the example results. Therefore, ""bluf"" likely means ""repeating the color of the previous word,"" as in all examples, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its impact on the output across all given examples.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- ""Walm"" causes a repetition of the color for ""wif,"" which is red, three times before proceeding to ""zup.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""Walm"" leads to ""dax"" being repeated in color three times, which is green.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- In this case, ""walm"" results in repeating the color for ""wif"" three times, which is red.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Once again, ""walm"" causes the color for ""zup"" to be repeated, this time as three yellows.

Based on the above, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.09363016496501204,3,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the pattern and then identify the meaning or the rule that the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be dictating. 

Let's analyze each given input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""Walm"" at the end results in repeating ""yellow"" three times, which is the color related to ""zup"".

2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   In this sequence, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""Walm"" inserted after ""wif"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times, followed by the color related to ""zup"".

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and its occurrence before ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" repeated three times.

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   The colors correspond to each word individually until ""walm"" appears. After ""walm"", the sequence draws from ""wif""'s corresponding color ""red"" repeated three times, followed by the colors for ""lug"" and ""zup"".

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Like in previous examples, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and its pairing with ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before ""walm"" three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be inferred as:

walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",-0.09768815768378311,3,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first analyze the patterns in the examples given:

1. Every time ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
2. Every time ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
3. Every time ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
4. Every time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""

Now, let's consider the position of ""walm"" and its corresponding output:

1. In ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""yellow yellow.""
2. In ""wif walm zup,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red.""
3. In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green.""
4. In ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red.""
5. In ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""

Based on the above, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it twice. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the output color of the preceding word two additional times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word twice.",-0.46743931685433737,3,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

1. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
2. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
3. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
4. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in at least one instance.
5. Every time ""walm"" is used, the word immediately following it (if any) is translated to a color consistently with its other translations, and the word “walm” itself results in repetitions of this same color.

Using this information, we can devise a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that the immediately following word represents. If there is no word after ""walm,"" it repeats the color for the word before “walm.”

Therefore:

walm -> The word ""walm"" induces repetition of the color name of the word that follows it in the sequence. If followed by ""zup,"" it repeats ""yellow""; if followed by ""wif,"" it repeats ""red""; if followed by ""dax,"" it repeats ""green"".

- After ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""

"Based on the input and output patterns provided in the examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" and its usage within the examples.

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here, and given that the output is ""yellow green"", this reinforces that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
- If we assume ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as previously deduced, then ""lug"" would correspond to ""blue"".

Input: dax walm wif walm

2. When ""dax"" is on its own, the output is just ""green"".
3. When ""dax"" follows ""lug"", the output sequence includes ""green blue"".
4. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output for each ""walm"" that appears right after ""dax"" is a double occurrence of ""green"" followed by ""red"".

Analyzing the pattern, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. However, its occurrence can influence the color output of the words that follow it. Specifically, ""walm"" after ""dax"" becomes a set of ""green red"", repeated for each occurrence of ""walm"".

5. When ""walm"" is the last word following ""dax"":

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- In example 1, the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in a series of ""green.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" and still, there's a ""green"" following ""dax.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in a series of ""red.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in a series of ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows directly after ""dax,"" again leading to a series of ""green.""

What's apparent from these examples is that ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Hence, the rule for ""walm"" might be that it repeats the color of the previous word a certain number of times, possibly until the string ends or a new color word is introduced.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us examine each example and the corresponding output.

1. ""dax walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green green green red red"":
    - ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green.""
    - ""wif"" corresponds with the second ""green.""
    - ""bluf"" corresponds with the last ""red.""

2. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"":

    - ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red.""

4. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"":

5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green"":
    - ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red.""
    - ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""red.""
    - ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green.""

Now to focus on ""walm"": it seems that ""walm"" by itself repeats the color of the word before it as many times up to a maximum of three times. For instance:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green,"" and it outputs ""green green.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which correlates with ""yellow,"" but since the output sequence has only ""one"" color repetition after that, ""walm"" must adapt to the series, thus green.
- In the third example, after ""wif"" which is ""red,"" ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
- In the fourth example, after ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green,"" and it outputs ""green green.""

From these observations, the rule that can be established is:

Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""walm"" results in a  repetition of the preceding color three times.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""walm"" results in a repetition of the last mentioned color.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" does not seem to have an output, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""walm"" again results in a repetition of the last mentioned color.

By analyzing all the examples, we can see that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the immediately preceding color word in the input, and it seems that it repeats the color three times, except when the color is repeated at the end of the input (as seen in the input ""lug walm"").

The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" and the output is three repetitions of ""blue.""

5. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

From this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: ""Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.""",-0.11636388540819279,5,walm
"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce a rule for what ""walm"" means based on the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
4. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
5. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

By analyzing the input and output pairs, we can notice the following:

- The word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it. 
- The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words since the last color word until ""walm"" (inclusive).

Checking against the examples:
1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" follows it, leading to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" follows it, leading to ""red"" being repeated four times (including the word ""lug"" as a start sequence).
3. ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" follows it, leading to ""red"" being repeated three times (since ""bluf"" doesn't seem to correspond to a color, as it's not represented in the output).
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", leading to ""blue"" being repeated three times due to ""walm"".
5. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" follows it, with four words in between (bluf, dax, lug, zup), not counting the final ""lug"", thus leading to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Based on these observations, we can construct the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the last color word said before ""walm"", repeating it as many times as there are words from the last color word to ""walm"" (inclusive).

Rule: If ""X"" is a color word, and ""X walm"" is the input sequence, the output should repeat the color associated with ""X"" a number of times equal to the count of words from the last color word to ""walm"" (inclusive). If there are words that don't directly translate to colors (such as ""bluf"" or ""dax""), they are included in the count but do not have a corresponding color in the output.",-0.13089604451433734,5,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe the transformation from input to output in each example. Here's how the inputs and outputs correlate:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
4. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
5. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

Observations:
- The word before ""walm"" seems to be repeated in the output color sequence, each time the number of repetitions increases by one.
- When ""walm"" appears without a preceding color word, it defaults to what appears to be the last mentioned color and repeats it an increasing number of times (with the starting point being three repetitions).

Hypothesis:
- ""walm"" causes the last color word before it to repeat in the output, starting with three repetitions and incrementing by one for each subsequent color word found before ""walm"".

Examples with hypothesis:
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (because ""zup"" is before ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is outputted thrice.)
- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"" (as ""wif"" is before ""walm"", red is outputted and the count starts at three repetitions.)
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" (as ""zup"" is before ""walm"", yellow is outputted three times, but blue is mentioned once more after ""walm"" as well.)

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by identifying patterns in the input that correspond to patterns in the output.

Looking at the outputs for the given inputs, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that comes immediately before it. More specifically:

- When ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue) comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""lug wif"" (blue red) comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times, suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the most recent color, which in this case is ""red.""
- When ""zup bluf wif"" (yellow yellow red) comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times, again suggesting ""walm"" repeats the most recent color.
- Lastly, in the input ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" and thus ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color word that immediately precedes it three times in the output.

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Each occurrence of the word ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the number of times ""green"" appears in the output is directly proportional to the number of times ""dax"" appears in the input.

However, since the examples provided do not show variation in the appearance of ""dax"" (it always appears once in each input except for the examples that are exactly the same), we cannot deduce a variation in the meaning of ""dax"" beyond its consistent translation to ""green."" 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

- In the second example, after ""wif"" comes ""bluf dax walm,"" and the output features ""red"" followed by another ""red"" and then three greens (""red red green green green"").

- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm lug"" becomes ""yellow red red red blue,"" showing that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm,"" following ""wif,"" leads to another ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup wif"" directly translates to ""yellow red,"" once again confirming ""zup"" for ""yellow"" and ""wif"" for ""red.""

Since ""wif"" directly results in ""red"" and seems to duplicate the color corresponding to the word following it (except for ""zup""), the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and also causes the following word to repeat its color association.

- Example 4: Input ""lug bluf"" yields Output ""blue blue."" Here, the color before ""bluf"" is blue (lug corresponds to blue), and the color output for ""bluf"" is also blue.

- Example 5: Input ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" yields Output ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" Again, the color before ""bluf"" is yellow (zup corresponds to yellow), and the color output for ""bluf"" is also yellow.

Following this pattern, we can devise the rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that the word immediately before it represents.",-0.27074976288352826,6,bluf
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided, it becomes apparent that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and when ""bluf"" follows it, the output is ""red red"".
In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" makes it ""red red"" again.
In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" following it results in ""yellow yellow"".
In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" following it gives ""blue blue"".
In the last example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" after it gives ""yellow yellow"". Additionally, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" after it results in ""blue blue"".

Using these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: The output for ""bluf"" is the color that directly precedes it, repeated once.",-1.3474501677310116,6,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples and look for a pattern associated with this word. Let's break down each input and its corresponding output to see how ""walm"" affects the result:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word just before it three times.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   Rule: Here, ""walm"" also causes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times, before continuing with the colors associated with ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red).
   
3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to repeat three times, followed by the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red).

4. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Rule: Both ""zup"" and ""lug"" have their associated colors outputted once, but when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color associated with ""lug"" is repeated three more times.

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Rule: The pattern is consistent; ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated three times, before moving on to the color associated with the next word, ""dax"" (green).

Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in an input, it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be outputted three times in a row, before proceeding with any subsequent colors associated with words that may follow.

walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.09475509307736846,6,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
Here, the word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is three ""yellow"".

Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again, and the output is again three ""yellow"" followed by colors that correspond to the words ""lug"" and ""wif"" respectively.

Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three ""green"" followed by ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif"".

Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which follows ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow"" for ""zup"", followed by three ""blue"" which correlates with ""lug walm"".

Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
Similarly, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is three ""blue"" followed by ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"".

From these examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Thus:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is three blues (""blue blue blue"").

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the given examples. Each example has a sequence of input ""words"" and a corresponding sequence of output ""colors."" By comparing the input sequences to the output sequences, we can try to identify what color is assigned to each word, including ""bluf.""

Let's compare the input-output pairs for patterns:

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""walm"" with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red.""

2. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue.""

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""walm"" with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red.""

4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green.""

By examining these patterns, we can try to induce the rule for ""bluf."" The word ""bluf"" appears to have a different output color in each sequence. However, in all cases, ""bluf"" results in the color of the word that immediately follows it in the output sequence. Here are the instances:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which is ""green"" in the output, so ""bluf"" results in ""red,"" the color of the word ""wif"" that precedes it.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" has no following word, so it repeats the color of the previous word, which is ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"").
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" (""blue""), and the previous color is ""red"" (""wif"").
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by no word, so it repeats the color of ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and the output color is ""red,"" which is the color for ""wif.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word that follows it, or if there is no following word, it repeats the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that follows it; if there is no following word, the color of the preceding word.",-0.09019933381330608,9,bluf
"Analyzing the examples given, it seems that the output colors are determined by the input words. Let's focus particularly on the word ""bluf"" and its corresponding outputs:

1. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
2. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

First, we need to establish what colors are assigned to ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" based on the outputs. From the examples, we can infer the following:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" (as seen in example 1 and 3)
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Given these color assignments to the input words, let's look at the outputs immediately following the word ""bluf"":

1. bluf -> red
2. bluf -> yellow
3. bluf -> blue
4. bluf -> yellow
5. bluf -> red

Comparing these outputs with the inputs just before ""bluf"":

1. (Input: wif) bluf -> red (Matches ""wif"")
2. (Input: zup) bluf -> yellow (Matches ""zup"")
3. (Input: lug) bluf -> blue (Matches ""lug"")
4. (Input: zup) bluf -> yellow (Matches ""zup"")
5. (Input: wif) bluf -> red (Matches ""wif"")

From these comparisons, we can see that the color of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately before it. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf duplicates the color of the preceding word.",-0.11159497576467346,9,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern for the colors:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" only appears twice and it is followed by ""dax"" or ""lug"", which correspond to ""blue"" in both cases. However, it is not sufficient to determine the pattern for ""walm"" with certainty.

Now let's analyze the pattern for ""bluf"":

1. In the first example, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", it results in a series of ""blue"" and then a shift to ""red"" occurs. The ""red"" continues onto the next ""dax"" then back to ""green"":
   ""dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green red red green""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end and the color sequence switches from ""blue"" to ""yellow"":
   ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow""

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" appears again at the end and the color sequence has a single ""blue"" followed by another ""blue"":
   ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""

4. In the fourth example, after ""bluf"" the color changes from ""yellow"" to ""yellow"":
   ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""

5. In the fifth example, after ""bluf"" the color changes from ""red"" to ""green"":
   ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""

From these observations, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be noted to create the following outcomes:

- It can cause a repetition of the previous color, as seen with ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" and ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue"".
- It can change the sequence to the next color associated with a word that follows it, as seen with ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green"" and ""dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green red red green"".

Given the variations, it seems that ""bluf"" influences the color sequence based on the context of the words around it, either by repeating a color or transitioning to another color based on an associated word. However, the examples provided are insufficient for an irrefutable rule because of the seemingly contradictory outcomes after ""bluf"". A tentative rule based on the current information might be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" typically causes a repetition of the previous color. If there is a color-indicating word following ""bluf"", there may be a transition to that color, but this is not consistent across all examples, as seen with the ""green yellow yellow"" pattern in the fourth example, which doesn't conform to the presumed rule.

Given this inconsistency and the limited data, a definitive rule for ""bluf"" is indeterminate and more examples are required to accurately deduce its meaning.",-0.3060881022060206,9,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it outputs the color that would be produced if the colors represented by the two words immediately before ""bluf"" were mixed together. Let's confirm this with the examples:

In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". Red and green make yellow, thus ""bluf"" translates here to yellow.

In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". Since yellow mixed with yellow still results in yellow, ""bluf"" translates to yellow again.

The pattern that emerges from the examples is that ""bluf"" takes on the color that is the result of mixing the colors represented by the words immediately preceding it.

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> the color resulting from the mixture of the colors represented by the two preceding words.

If only one word precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" seems to take on the same color as the word before it, indicating that a color mixed with itself doesn't change.",-1.362840967785715,9,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" acts as an indicator for the color that comes before it to be repeated once more in the output sequence. The repeated color follows immediately after the word ""bluf"" in the output. Let's verify this rule with the examples provided:

- In the first example, the color before ""bluf"" is red (from ""wif""), after ""bluf"" the color red is repeated.
- In the second example, the color before ""bluf"" is yellow (from ""lug""), after ""bluf"" the color yellow is repeated.
- In the third example, the color before ""bluf"" is red (from ""wif""), after ""bluf"" the color red is repeated.
- In the fourth example, the color before ""bluf"" is yellow (from ""zup""), after ""bluf"" the color yellow is repeated.
- In the fifth example, the color before ""bluf"" is red (from ""wif""), after ""bluf"" the color red is repeated.

"From the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Let's consider each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

In these first two examples, we can see that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that comes just before it. ""dax"" is associated with green and ""lug"" with blue. Hence, ""walm"" after ""dax"" gives us ""green"" repeated three times, and after ""lug"" gives us ""blue"" repeated three times.

3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Here ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with yellow. Then ""walm"" is followed by three yellows (the repetition of ""zup's"" color) before moving on to the colors associated with ""dax"" and ""lug"" respectively.

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

In this example, ""walm"" again follows ""dax"" (associated with green) and is repeated three times after ""dax's"" color.

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Here, ""walm"" follows the word ""wif"" (associated with red) and we see ""red"" repeated three times before proceeding to the output for ""lug"".

Based on the evidence, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes whatever color word comes before it in the input to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word before ""walm"" three times in the output.",-0.05796682080722224,9,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" we can analyze the output patterns in relation to the input placing special attention to the position and surrounding words of ""walm"" within the inputs. 

Analyzing the patterns:

1. ""dax lug walm"" => ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""lug dax walm"" => ""blue green green green""
3. ""zup walm dax lug"" => ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
4. ""wif lug dax walm"" => ""red blue green green green""
5. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" => ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""

From these examples, we can discern that the output color is repeated a number of times depending on the words in the input. Moreover, the repetition occurs right after the color that correlates to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". The ""walm"" seems to create repetitions of the color that would correspond to the word just before it.

Let's induce the specific rule:

1. To start with a basic case, example 1 shows the sequence ""dax lug"" followed by ""walm"", which results in ""green blue blue blue"". Here we see the color blue is repeated three times. It seems ""walm"" might introduce a repetition of the color associated with the word ""lug"".

2. In example 2, the sequence ""lug dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""blue green green green"". Again, the color right before ""walm"", green in this case, is repeated three times.

3. In example 3, the sequence ""zup walm dax lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". Here, the color yellow associated with ""zup"" is repeated three times before continuing with the colors for ""dax"" and ""lug"".

4. Example 4, ""wif lug dax walm"", turns into ""red blue green green green"", where we see the color green is repeated three times after the initial ""red"" and ""blue"". This supports the repetition based on the immediate precursor word.

5. Finally, example 5, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", becomes ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". Here, the immediate word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which correlates to the color red. The color red is then repeated three times, followed by the color blue for the final ""lug"".

From this, we can derive the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Thus:

walm -> meaning: The repetition of the previous word's corresponding color three times.",-0.09179552392066664,9,walm

- In ""lug dax walm"", ""dax"" represents green, so ""walm"" becomes ""green green green"".
- In ""zup walm dax lug"", ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""wif lug dax walm"", ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""walm"" becomes ""green green green"".
- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""wif"" represents red, so ""walm"" becomes ""red red red"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the given examples and their corresponding outputs. Observing each instance where ""walm"" appears, it seems to affect the color outputs that follow the word ""walm."" Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. In the first example, the output sequence following ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue."" Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color blue.
2. In the second example, the output sequence following ""walm"" is ""green green green,"" implying that ""walm"" repeats the color green after its appearance.
3. In the third example, we notice that ""walm"" is followed by three yellows and one green, reflecting the previous colors of ""zup"" and ""lug"" respectively.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by three greens, again repeating the color associated with ""dax"" that appears before ""walm.""
5. The fifth example is more complex, but following ""walm,"" we have a sequence of ""red red red blue,"" which repeats the colors corresponding to ""wif"" and ""lug"" appearing before ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output colors to repeat the sequence of colors that appear immediately before ""walm"" in the input.

From the given examples:

"Examining the examples given, it appears that bluf correlates with a specific color pattern that reflects the preceding colors. Each example displays a series of unique color outputs matching the number of words preceding the term bluf. One noteworthy point is that the output after bluf always contains the word green. Furthermore, the colors in the output after bluf consistently match the colors of the words before bluf in reverse order:

Example Analyses:
1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": This suggests dax correlates with green.
2. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"": Here, lug could be blue and wif red, thus bluf results in red again.
3. ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> ""red yellow green green"": The sequence of wif (red), zup (yellow), and dax (green) is followed by another green.
4. ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow"": Despite the order changing, after dax (green), bluf results in another green, followed by the colors wif (red) and zup (yellow) in reverse order.
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow"": Here, after wif (red), lug (blue), and zup (yellow), the term bluf correlates with another yellow.

Combining these observations, we can deduce the rule for bluf as follows:

Rule: bluf duplicates the color associated with the immediately preceding word (if there's a single word before bluf) or follows a pattern where it begins by repeating the last color mentioned and continues by reflecting the colors of the words before bluf in reverse order (if there's more than one word before bluf).

Hence, we can say that the term bluf itself doesn't have a specific meaning as a color but rather a behavior of mimicking and reversing the sequence of colors denoted by the words that precede it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning: Bluf duplicates the color of the word directly preceding it and results in the colors that precede it being mirrored in reverse order.",-0.11885602825956407,10,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" affects the output in the following manner:

1. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""
2. ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red""
3. ""wif zup dax bluf"" results in ""red yellow green green""
4. ""dax bluf wif zup"" results in ""green green red yellow""
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow""

In all cases, the output colors are doubled when ""bluf"" follows a word, except when there are two words following ""bluf"" in sequence (""dax bluf wif zup"") where the doubling stops after the first occurrence. So, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word directly before it, and this effect can be overridden by the next word if it immediately follows ""bluf"".

Rule: ""bluf"" -> causes the next word's associated color to double, but only once if another word is present immediately after ""bluf"".",-0.12097865415920515,10,bluf

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",-0.14286644500947435,10,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the outputs related to inputs that contain ""bluf.""

2. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
3. ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> ""red yellow green green""
4. ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow""

Looking at the examples, we can attempt to associate colors with the words given. For each case, ""bluf"" is always followed by ""green"" color in the output, except for the last example where ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"". Since ""bluf"" is present in each input and produces an output in the last position, we might infer that ""bluf"" takes on the color that was just mentioned before it, doubling that color in the output. This would hold true for all examples except the fifth, where instead of ""blue"" repeating, which is before ""bluf,"" we see a ""yellow"" which seems out of pattern. If we were to assume that there might be an error in the fifth example, we would then assume it to follow the logic of the other four examples.

However, we might need to consider that ""bluf"" is a wildcard that takes on a preceding color's value when applicable but defaults to a certain color (like yellow) when there is no direct precedent or under specific circumstances not elucidated by the current examples.

Without understanding the exact conditions that change ""bluf"" to ""yellow"" in the last example, we can propose a tentative rule based on the information given:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color repeated from its preceding term, defaulting to ""yellow"" when such repetition is not indicated. In the provided examples, such repetition is indicated in all but the last example, potentially due to an error or an unexplained condition.

In the second example, ""lug wif bluf"" leads to ""blue red red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" copies the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to affect its output (it is consistently ""green"" no matter where it is in the sequence).

- In an input sequence with multiple instances of ""wif,"" each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to a ""red"" in the output sequence, followed by a color associated with the word immediately following the first ""wif.""

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""dax"" is followed by the color ""green"" each time it appears.
- ""Dax"" is not dependent on its position in the sequence as it is found in various positions (beginning, middle, end) and the output is always ""green"".
- The output is not dependent on the word that precedes or follows ""dax"".
- The word ""dax"" does not affect the color associated with other words, as evidenced by other words consistently translating to the same color regardless of the presence of ""dax"".

Given these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" is clear:

Rule: dax -> green",-1.4996135481411763,12,dax

"Based on the examples provided, each word seems to translate to a specific color. To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for a consistent pattern in the outputs that corresponds to the input of ""wif.""

Let's analyze the input and output pairings:

1. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red.""
   - Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow.""
   - Here, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" and since ""bluf"" appears only once, we can infer that ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" Since ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the first color in the output is ""red,"" this suggests that ""wif"" also translates to ""red.""

3. ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green.""
   - ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow,"" and observing that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" both times it appears after ""zup"" and ""wif."" Since ""wif"" comes before the first ""dax"" and the first color is ""red,"" it continues to support that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

4. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif,"" which seems to translate again to ""red."" ""Walm"" is only present in this example, and since it results in ""red red"" after ""wif,"" it might mean ""red"" as well, or it could be repeating the color of the preceding word; however, the pattern is insufficient to draw a conclusion about ""walm.""

5. ""zup lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow red green.""
   - Here, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" appears for the first time and translates to ""blue,"" while ""wif"" and ""dax"" maintain their previous translations to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively.

Based on these analyses, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example provided. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.09186614756362502,12,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we will analyze each example and the corresponding outputs to identify patterns. Let's break it down instance by instance:

1. Input: zup wif   -> Output: yellow red
2. Input: wif bluf zup  -> Output: red red yellow
3. Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green
4. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
5. Input: zup lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow blue yellow red green

Here are some initial observations:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is in the corresponding position in the output.
- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf zup"" and in the output, ""red red yellow"" appears, suggesting that ""bluf"" possibly corresponds to ""red"" since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" could correspond to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" by itself corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" by itself seems to correspond to ""green.""

The word ""wif"" appears in various positions across the examples, and each time it is present, ""red"" is part of the output. This consistency leads to the conclusion that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be: wif -> red.",-0.10458080047700002,12,wif
"The provided examples suggest that each unique word maps to a unique color. To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's examine the consistent aspects of each example where ""wif"" appears:

1. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
2. ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow""
3. ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green""
4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
5. ""zup lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue yellow red green""

From the examples, we can see that:

- When ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""zup,"" (examples 1, 3), the output is ""red"" immediately before ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" or any other word that does not have a known mapping (example 2), it results in ""red red"" where the second ""red"" is the known output for ""bluf.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" a word that does not appear in any other example (example 4), it translates to ""red,"" while the following unknown word translates to ""red red red.""
- ""wif"" does not always require a word after it to result in ""red"" (example 1).

Based on this pattern, regardless of its position or the subsequent word, ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",-0.12222188694087503,12,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" To support this induction, let's break down each example:

- In the first example, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and following ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is produced.
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears first and results in ""red,"" ""bluf"" is not shown in the output, and ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" with ""zup"" once again translating to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, after ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""walm"" is not represented in the output but is preceded and followed by ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" appears twice as ""yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" again equates to ""red,"" followed by ""dax"" which shows up as ""green.""

Hence, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"" as:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.5505278695758751,12,wif
"Rule: Each word corresponds to a color: zup -> yellow, wif -> red, bluf -> red, dax -> green, lug -> blue, walm -> red. 

Thus, wif translates to the color red. 

wif -> red.",-0.72452033612875,12,wif
"Using the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""zup."" Let's look at each input and its corresponding output to identify patterns:

1. Input: zup walm  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow  
   Here, ""zup"" leads to one yellow, and ""walm"" seems to correspond to two additional yellows.

2. Input: zup  
   Output: yellow  
   ""Zup"" on its own produces one yellow, consistent with the previous example.

3. Input: zup bluf  
   Output: yellow yellow  
   ""Zup"" leads to one yellow, and ""bluf"" adds another yellow, differing from ""walm"" which added two yellows.

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow  
   This is the same as the previous line, providing consistency for ""zup"" and ""bluf.""

5. Input: zup dax lug dax  
   Output: yellow green blue green  
   ""Zup"" results in yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green (seen twice), and ""lug"" leads to a blue.

Based on the above examples, it appears that ""zup"" on its own always results in ""yellow."" The addition of other words after ""zup"" results in additional colors.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow,"" each time it is used, it outputs ""yellow."" Subsequent word(s) in the input after ""zup"" determine additional colors in the output, with each word consistently leading to a specific color.",-0.12328652886806453,12,zup
"zup -> meaning. Rule: The word ""zup"" probably triggers a sequence of colored words in the output. Each word after ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color, except for ""zup"" which always corresponds to ""yellow"". The sequence and color associated with each nonce word seems consistent across examples. Specifically:

- If ""zup"" is the only word in the input, it corresponds to a single ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""walm"" following ""zup"" produces three ""yellow"" which suggests that ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" color.
- The word ""bluf"" consistently produces an additional ""yellow"", indicating it might signify a repetition or continuation of the previous color without introducing a new color.
- The sequence ""dax lug dax"" after ""zup"" produces ""green blue green"", indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

So, based on the examples, the rule would appear to be that ""zup"" signals the start and color ""yellow"", with subsequent nonce words indicating additional colors or repeats.",-0.4171026605080643,12,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context. Each instance of a unique nonce word following ""zup"" refers to a unique color. ""Walm"" doesn’t appear with an output color, but considering ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" and that ""bluf"" appears twice and is associated with two instances of ""yellow,"" it seems likely that each unique nonce word after ""zup"" adds a color. ""Walm"" would repeat ""yellow"" as ""bluf"" does. The presence of ""zup"" sets the pattern of colors to follow.",-0.7974058192,12,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" appears to translate to the word ""yellow"". Each subsequent word seems to translate to a color as well, with ""bluf"" most likely translating to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" translating to ""green"". The word ""lug"" is used only once in the examples, translating to ""blue"". It appears that the presence of ""zup"" at the beginning of the input dictates that the output should start with ""yellow"", regardless of the other words present.

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> yellow (inferred from repeated outputs)
dax -> green (from the last example where ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"")
lug -> blue (from the last example where ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"")

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the examples provided.

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

From these examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" influences the output to repeat the color associated with the word right before it three times. In example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" we see ""red red red."" In example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" we see ""green green green."" This pattern holds for all the examples provided.

Therefore, the rule is: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.",-0.08867033957284091,12,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the word ""walm"".

1. In the first example, 'zup wif walm', the output is 'yellow red red red'. Here, 'wif' generates 'red', and since 'zup' produces 'yellow', 'walm' seems to be repeating the color from the preceding word.

2. In the second example, 'dax walm', the output is 'green green green'. Here, 'dax' seems to produce 'green', and 'walm' is repeating it twice more.

3. In the third example, 'lug walm wif lug bluf', the output is 'blue blue blue red blue blue'. 'Lug' produces 'blue', immediately followed by three 'blue'. This suggests 'walm' repeats the preceding color twice. 'Wif' gives us 'red', and 'bluf' is followed by 'blue', although it's not preceded by 'walm'.

4. In the fourth example, 'dax walm zup lug dax', the output is 'green green green yellow blue green'. We again see 'dax' followed by three 'green', signaling that 'walm' repeats 'green' twice after 'dax'. 'Zup' results in 'yellow', 'lug' in 'blue', and 'dax' at the end provides 'green'.

5. In the fifth example, 'wif bluf dax walm', the output is 'red red green green green'. 'Wif' produces 'red', but 'bluf' doesn't seem to affect the color sequence. 'Dax' gives 'green', and 'walm' repeats it twice.

By analyzing these examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word twice. Therefore:

walm -> rule: Repeat the color word that precedes 'walm' twice.",-0.08902192801227272,12,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"": It seems that ""walm"" in this context has resulted in three reds following the pattern.
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"": Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three greens.
3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue"": ""walm"" corresponds to three blues in between the pattern.

5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"": And here ""walm"" corresponds to three greens.

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" represents a repetition of three of the color that is indicated by the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Each color word is associated with a single color: ""zup"" with yellow, ""dax"" with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""wif"" with red.

1. In the first example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". Here, dax is situated between 'walm' and 'wif,' and the output is green, following two instances of blue.

3. In the sequence ""zup dax lug,"" where dax is between 'zup' and 'lug', the output for dax is green.

4. The sequence ""dax lug wif"" has an output of green for dax, followed by blue for lug and red for wif.

5. Finally, the sequence ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which suggests that the output green is a consequence of dax being followed by walm.

If ""bluf"" is immediately followed by another word (which is not ""bluf""), then ""green"" or ""blue"" is the output depending on the word following it, thus possibly overriding the ""red"" with a new color.

Taking the examples into consideration:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red  
   The word ""bluf"" resulted in ""red red.""

2. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax

3. Input: wif bluf dax

4. Input: wif bluf lug

   Both incidences of ""bluf"" presented ""red red,"" with the first ""bluf"" followed by ""dax,"" giving ""green,"" and the second ""bluf"" followed by ""wif,"" resulting in ""red.""

Considering these patterns, we can form a rule:

**Rule:**

For simplicity and without additional context, we could sum up bluf as:

"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output every time it appears. However, it is also important to note that the presence of ""bluf"" causes the next non-""bluf"" word to repeat its corresponding output color.

- In the first input, ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and hence the output for ""lug"" (""yellow"") is repeated.
- In the second input, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" (""green"") is repeated.
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" follows the first ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" (""green"") is repeated; ""wif"" follows the second ""bluf"" and the output for ""wif"" (""red"") is repeated.

- In the second example, ""lug walm"" creates ""blue blue blue,"" and when an additional word ""dax"" is present, one ""green"" is appended.

"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the pattern of the colors that follow the presence of the word ""dax.""

In each example, after ""dax"" appears, there is a pattern of colors starting with green. Moreover, the appearance of ""dax"" seems to produce the color green, no matter where it is placed in the sequence, with other colors following based on different words that follow ""dax.""

Here's the breakdown:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""green red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes a series of ""zup"" and ""walm,"" each ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" also to ""yellow,"" but ""dax"" at the beginning of the sequence changes the first color to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug zup,"" the output is ""green blue yellow,"" indicating that ""lug"" produces ""blue"" and ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" but the presence of ""dax"" at the start changes the first color to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" comes after ""zup lug zup,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow green,"" which means that ""dax"" at the end of a sequence still results in ""green"" at the end of the output sequence.
- When ""dax"" comes after ""lug walm,"" despite the sequence starting with ""blue blue,"" ""dax"" at the end still results in a ""green"" at the end of the output sequence.

So the general rule for ""dax"" seems to be that it converts the position it occupies in the input sequence into the color ""green"" in the output sequence, irrespective of its position and irrespective of other words that follow it.

Rule: dax -> The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the position where ""dax"" appears in the input sequence.",-0.4780276826576317,15,dax
"To determine the underlying rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we must look for patterns in the Input/Output sequences. By examining the outputs, we can infer the following correlations:

- Every time ""dax"" occurs, ""green"" is the first color in the Output sequence.
- The appearance of ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" at the end of the Output sequence.
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" except in the very last example where it does not precede ""dax"" and is therefore not translated into an output color. This might indicate a rule about sequence or position.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it occurs before ""dax.""

Looking at the placement of ""dax"" within the Input sequence gives us a clue as to its role in determining the Output sequence:

- If ""dax"" is at the beginning, the output sequence starts with ""green.""
- If ""dax"" is in the middle of other words (e.g., ""lug walm dax""), it still results in ""green"" being put at the end of the sequence.
- It seems that ""dax"" does not influence the output of words that are placed before it but does affect those that come after it (""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green"").

Based on this information, we can deduce the following rule for ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" signals the start of a sequence of colors, always represented by ""green"" in the output. Any words following ""dax"" are to be translated into their respective color outputs, whereas words before ""dax"" do not influence the sequence. If ""dax"" is not the first word, then the colors up until its appearance are repeated, and ""green"" is appended to the sequence.",-0.8177800016013158,15,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in each output. Each other word in the input corresponds to a color in the output:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow (noted from second input, since it repeats in sequence after ""zup"")

Given this pattern, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output, independent of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.",-0.873559350090658,15,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the introduction of the nonce word ""dax"" within a sequence leads to the word ""green"" being included in the output sequence, regardless of its position. ""Dax"" does not seem to influence the colors associated with other words; for example, ""wif"" consistently yields ""red"", ""zup"" consistently yields ""yellow"", and ""lug"" consistently yields ""blue"". ""Walm"" also consistently yields ""yellow"" but appears in fewer examples.

- ""zup"" consistently outputs ""yellow""

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the occurrences across the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue red red red blue.""
2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue.""
4. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red.""
5. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue green blue blue blue.""

If we look at the position before ""walm"" in every case:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""red.""
- In the second, ""zup"" precludes ""walm"" and follows with ""yellow.""
- In the third, ""wif"" again precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""red.""
- In the fourth, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""blue.""
- In the fifth, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and follows with ""blue.""

In each of these cases, ""`walm`"" appears to result in repeating the color produced by the word before it. The immediate rule seems to be that ""`walm`"" takes the color indicated by the previous word and repeats it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we observe the relationship between the input and output in each example.

From the first input and output pair:
- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- When ""walm"" occurs after ""lug wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated.
- When ""lug"" occurs alone after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated.

From the second input and output pair:
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- The sequence ""zup walm"" results in the color ""yellow"" being repeated.

From the third input and output pair:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- The sequence ""wif walm"" leads to the color ""red"" being repeated.

From the fourth input and output pair:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- The sequence ""lug walm"" leads to the color ""blue"" being repeated.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue"" from ""lug,"" ""red"" from ""wif,"" followed by another ""red"" because of ""walm.""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" from ""zup,"" followed by another ""yellow"" because of ""walm.""",-0.7800838643353772,15,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

From input 1: The sequence ""lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue red red red blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated once more before returning to ""blue"" for ""lug."" 

From input 2: The sequence ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated two additional times.

From input 3: ""wif walm lug"" translates to ""red red red blue."" Here, ""wif"" indicates ""red,"" and ""lug"" indicates ""blue."" Notice that after ""walm,"" ""red"" repeats twice before ""blue.""

From input 4: The sequence ""lug walm zup"" gives us ""blue blue blue yellow."" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated two more times before changing to ""yellow.""

From input 5: ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see the color ""blue"" repeated twice.

Distilling a rule from these instances, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color word that comes before it to be repeated twice more. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates a repetition of the previous color mentioned. 

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color word before ""walm"" two additional times.",-1.1066129923943397,15,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to represent a duplication of the color indicated by the previous nonce word. Each time ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the nonce word right before it. Here's how this interpretation plays out in each example:

- Example 1: ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue,"" where ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated because the previous word, ""wif,"" corresponds to ""red.""
- Example 2: ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""walm"" repeating the color corresponding to ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- Example 3: ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" duplicates the ""red"" from ""wif.""
- Example 4: ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" hence ""walm"" repeats the blue color indicated by ""lug"".
- Example 5: ""lug walm"" also translates to ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing that ""walm"" duplicates the color corresponding to ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns of the output colors associated with the presence of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the next color is ""red,"" which does not correspond with the normal pattern of ""lug"" leading to ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is prior to multiple occurrences of ""yellow,"" which seems to deviate from the pattern of ""zup"" because ""zup"" on its own does not result in multiple yellows in a row.
3. In the third example, after ""walm,"" we have an occurrence of multiple ""reds.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""blues.""
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by repeated ""blues.""

We can see that after each single instance of ""wif,"" the output is always 'red'. When 'wif' is preceded by 'dax', 'lug', or 'bluf', these words map to 'green', 'blue', and 'red' respectively. It seems 'wif' does not change the color associated with the word that follows 'wif'; rather, it just adds 'red' before the color that the next word represents. 

The rule induces that 'wif' translates to 'red'. Additionally, 'walm' produces 'red red red' consistently, suggesting it may mean a series of three 'red's, while other words map to a single color.

- ""dax wif walm"" produces ""green red red red."" When we see ""dax"" later without ""wif,"" it leads to green, and ""walm"" seems to correspond to a sequence of three reds.

To summarize:

- In the first example (""dax wif walm""), ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example (""wif dax""), ""wif"" is the first word and corresponds to the first color ""red"" in the output.
- In the third example (""lug wif walm""), ""wif"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output following ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug"".

"To deduce the meaning or the rule behind the word ""wif,"" let's examine the input and output pairs closely. 

1. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.
2. The word that comes after ""wif"" in the input also produces ""red"" in the output.
3. The words that precede ""wif"" seem to be associated with colors different from ""red.""

From the above observations, it seems that ""wif"" triggers the color ""red"" in the output. When ""wif"" precedes another word, that other word also translates to ""red.""

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position relative to ""wif.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" again regardless of its position relative to ""wif.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" typically results in two outputs, with the first part always being 'blue' and the second part mirroring the color output that directly precedes ""bluf"" in the input.

Let's examine the patterns:

- Every instance of ""bluf"" is translated into ""blue [color]"" in the output.
- The color that follows ""blue"" is the same color that directly precedes ""bluf"" in the input.
- For instance, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), the output is ""blue blue"". When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), the output is ""blue red"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correlation between the input and the output in each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   The ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""wif,"" with the color repeated as blue.

2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   Here, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" with the color repeated as red.

3. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   The ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color is repeated as green.

4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   Again, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" with the repeated color as green.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the repeated color is green.

Assessing the pattern, it seems that ""walm"" indicates repetition of color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.

For instance, if the input word before ""walm"" is ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" means that ""blue"" should be repeated in the output.",-0.07822144244562634,16,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples provided and identify any patterns that can help us understand its use.

In the first example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" with ""walm"" nestled between ""lug"" and ""wif.""

In the second example, ""wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow,"" and ""walm"" appears after ""wif.""

The third example, ""lug dax walm,"" results in ""blue green green green,"" and ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence.

In the fourth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here, ""walm"" occurs after ""dax"" and before ""lug.""

Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" turns into ""red red green green green."" ""Walm"" again appears at the end, following ""dax.""

From these examples, we can observe that ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, the output color is also blue. When it follows ""wif,"" which is red, the color red is repeated in the sequence. Similarly, when it follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, the color green is repeated several times.

Therefore, based on the observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the last color mentioned before ""walm"" to be repeated in the output. Hence, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the immediate preceding color to be repeated.",-0.0832337526587912,16,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to focus on the patterns emerging from the given sequences of inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Examining the sequences, we can notice the following patterns:

1. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
2. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
3. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
4. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
5. The word ""bluf"" (only appearing once) translates to ""red.""

Now let's focus on the sequences which include ""walm"":

- In the first sequence, ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" the sequence of colors is ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Noticing that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" it seems that ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated. (i.e., the first ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat).

- In the second sequence, ""wif walm zup,"" the sequence of colors is ""red red red yellow."" Here again ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and makes ""red"" repeat.

- In the third sequence, ""lug dax walm,"" the sequence of colors is ""blue green green green."" Here ""walm"" makes ""green"" repeat three times, signifying that ""walm"" causes whatever color word it follows to repeat multiple times (in this case ""green"" from ""dax"").

- In the fourth sequence, ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" the sequence of colors is ""yellow green green green blue red."" Once more, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green"" and that color repeats.

- In the fifth sequence, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the sequence of colors is ""red red green green green."" Despite ""bluf"" being new, the pattern of ""dax"" followed by ""green"" colors repeating after ""walm"" holds.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated a number of times, possibly dependent on some aspect of that previous word or the position of ""walm"" itself. Since the pattern of repetition varies, it may depend on specific rules not fully discernible from the examples given, such as the number of times the color is repeated or whether it has to do with the word's position.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat multiple times.",-0.08971709711261534,16,walm
"Analyzing the patterns in the given inputs and their associated outputs, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the colors that follow it, rather than having a direct color translation. Specifically, it seems to cause the following words to repeat the color that immediately precedes ""walm."" Let's review the evidence:

In the first example: ""lug walm wif zup wif"" the output is ""blue blue blue red yellow red"". Here, ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the next word ""wif"" is also translated to ""blue."" It continues to be ""blue"" for the next ""wif"" and then changes when a new color is introduced with ""zup.""

In the second example: ""wif walm zup"" the output is ""red red red yellow"". The word ""wif"" is translated to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" the color remains ""red"" until a new word ""zup"" introduces a different color, ""yellow.""

In the third example: ""lug dax walm"" the output is ""blue green green green"". ""Walm"" makes the words following it repeat the color of the preceding word, which in this case is ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""

In the fourth example: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" the output is ""yellow green green green blue red"". Here, the words following ""walm"" repeat the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" until a new word ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue.""

In the fifth example: ""wif bluf dax walm"" the output is ""red red green green green"". The color ""green"" from ""dax"" is repeated after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: After the word ""walm,"" the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word is repeatedly applied to the following words until a new color word interrupts the sequence.

Thus:

walm -> The word following ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding ""walm"" until a new color is introduced.",-0.094486782093011,16,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" means a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word (nonce or not). 

For instance:
- In ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" then produces additional ""blue"" until a new nonce word is introduced.
- In ""wif walm zup,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""walm"" continues the pattern of red until ""zup"" changes the sequence with yellow.
- In ""lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" continues green.
- In ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" ""dax"" is once again associated with green, and ""walm"" repeats the green until ""lug"" changes it to blue.
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""walm"" repeats green again.

- ""bluf"" does not correspond to any color in the output explicitly, but we can infer that it is likely to be a word that does not change the color output pattern (possibly a neutral word or a filler).

"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the rule for ""zup"" as follows:

In every instance, the output immediately following ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After the appearance of ""zup,"" it seems to change the color associated with the following word to ""yellow"" one time, and then that word returns to its original color if mentioned again downstream in the series.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup walm,"" we have ""dax"" and ""walm"" occurring before ""zup,"" and after ""walm"" there is ""zup,"" followed by ""walm"" again. The colors for ""dax"" and the first ""walm"" are green, but after ""zup,"" ""walm"" turns yellow, indicating that ""zup"" changed its color.

2. In the second example, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug,"" we see that ""zup"" at the beginning turns ""dax"" yellow, and ""zup"" before ""bluf"" also turns ""bluf"" yellow after being red initially.

3. In the third example, ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""zup"" turns ""lug"" yellow, and ""dax"" retains its green color after ""lug,"" showing that ""zup"" has a one-time effect on the word that follows it.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" again, ""zup"" turns the following ""walm"" and later ""dax"" yellow.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup lug dax lug,"" ""zup"" changes the color of ""lug"" to yellow, and then ""dax"" follows with green, and ""lug"" returns to its original blue.

So the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it changes the color associated with the next word to ""yellow,"" but has no effect on subsequent instances of the same word. 

zup -> Changes the color associated with the following word to yellow, one-time effect per occurrence.",-0.45407379819190935,17,zup
"Based on the pattern in the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately following it. Notably, the presence of ""zup"" causes the color of the next word to be repeated an additional two times, making for three instances in total.

For example:
- In the first example, ""dax walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm,"" which represents the color yellow, is repeated three times as a result of ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" The ""zup"" before ""dax"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times, and the ""zup"" before the second occurrence of ""bluf"" results in three repetitions of ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: ""zup"" -> Causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated three times total.",-0.647096232310374,17,zup
"Based on the input-output patterns, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

1. When ""zup"" is present, it seems to cause the word that follows it to repeat its output color. 
   
   - In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
   - In the second example, ""bluf"" follows the first ""zup"" and ""yellow"" is followed by ""blue"", then ""zup"" appears again and is followed by another ""yellow blue"" pattern.
   - In the third example, ""lug"" follows ""zup"" and its color ""blue"" is outputted right after ""yellow"".
   - In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows the first ""zup"" and generates ""yellow yellow yellow"", ""dax"" follows the second ""zup"" and ""yellow green"" is the pattern.
   - In the fifth example, ""lug"" follows ""zup"" and ""yellow blue"" is the output pattern.

2. When ""zup"" is the first word, the first two colors in the output sequence are always ""yellow"". When ""zup"" is not the first word, it results in one ""yellow"" in the output.

3. ""zup"" does not seem to generate a color of its own but rather it affects the output color of the word that comes after it.

Combining these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" causes the output of the following word to repeat, starting with ""yellow"". If ""zup"" is the initial word in the input sequence, then ""yellow"" is output twice before the color associated with the following word. If ""zup"" is not the first word, ""yellow"" is output once before the color of the following word.",-1.1384916627121497,17,zup
"Based on the examples you've provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of what other words (such as ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" or ""wif"") are present.

Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" in this context can be concluded as follows:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",-1.1471632645651402,17,zup

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze its occurrence in each input and the corresponding output:

1. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""

2. zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
   - ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""

3. wif bluf -> red red
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and the output is ""red.""

4. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""

5. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and the output is ""blue.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" results in an output color that matches the color of the word that precedes it. Here's the deduced meaning:

- ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""blue,""
- ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""green,""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the input and output strings.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" is translated to ""red,"" and since ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" it suggests ""walm"" causes the repetition of the prior color.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""green"" twice more. ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""red"" twice more. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" with no repetition following it.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"" being repeated twice. This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the preceding color word in the output.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which causes ""red"" to repeat twice more. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" without repetition.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- Each color word seems to translate directly (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red""), and ""walm"" following ""wif"" causes ""red"" to be repeated twice more.

Based on these examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it twice more. 

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the preceding color in the output two additional times.",-0.09707851387926315,17,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color word in the output. Specifically, it appears that ""walm"" is indicating that the color before ""walm"" should be repeated thrice. To further confirm this pattern, let's examine each input/output pair:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red"" repeated three times.

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Both are followed by ""walm"" and the output for each is their respective color repeated three times. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is not followed by ""walm"", so it appears once.

3. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - Only ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", and ""yellow"" is the color repeated three times in the output.

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times. ""zup"" is not followed by ""walm"" and appears once as ""yellow"".

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""red"" being repeated three times. Neither ""lug"" nor ""bluf"" is followed by ""walm"", and their colors appear once in the output.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

"Examining the provided examples, we can infer a rule based on the color outputs corresponding to the nonce words and their positions. Each word seems to translate to a unique color, except for ""bluf,"" which seems to depend on the words around it. Let's look closely:

Input: dax zup lug bluf

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf

Based on inputs and outputs, ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color output that directly precedes it:
- In the first and fifth examples, ""zup"" leads to the color yellow, and ""bluf"" also outputs yellow.
- In the second example, ""lug"" leads to the color blue, and ""bluf"" outputs blue as well.
- In the third example, ""lug"" again precedes ""bluf"" and both correlate to the color blue.
- In the fourth example, it's a bit tricky since the output after ""bluf"" varies, suggesting that ""bluf"" might follow a different rule when multiple words are involved.

Rule:
To deduce a consistent rule for the meaning of bluf from the given examples, we should look for patterns in the output colors. A pattern that emerges is that the color for bluf seems to depend on the word that comes before it:

- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"", bluf corresponds to blue (Examples 2 and 3).
- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", bluf corresponds to red red (Example 4) or just yellow (Example 5). The double red in example 4 appears to be an anomaly as ""wif"" consistently maps to red in other examples. It could be a typographical error or a special exception not explained by other inputs, such as ""walm"" creating an impact.

From the given examples, the rule for ""bluf"" is not consistently clear because the output for ""bluf"" isn't consistent following the same input word (e.g., ""wif"" before ""bluf"" leads to different outputs). The complexity or error in Example 4 warrants more information to accurately deduce a rule, or we must assume an exception or an error in that instance. 

With the information provided, and assuming a potential error or exception in Example 4, the most consistent rule we can infer is:

When ""lug"" is immediately followed by ""bluf"", bluf corresponds to blue. Without further consistent examples or clarifications, the rule for other instances (e.g., when ""wif"" or ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"") cannot be conclusively stated.

bluf -> The rule cannot be fully determined with the given examples, but it seems to correlate with the word immediately preceding it, predominantly resulting in blue when preceded by ""lug"".",-0.10642785217420689,18,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and their respective outputs to find patterns that can be associated with the nonce word.

3. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
4. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
5. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow

Observations:

- Every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears once or twice immediately following the position of ""bluf"" in the output.
- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red"" based on the inputs and outputs where they are not adjacent to ""bluf.""
- ""zup"" appears to translate to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" while not adjacent to ""bluf.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" the output for ""bluf"" consists of two occurrences of ""blue.""

Given these observations, the possible rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""blue,"" and when it is preceded by the word that also translates as ""blue"" (which is ""lug""), it doubles the output color (i.e., two instances of ""blue"" instead of one).

- For every instance where ""bluf"" is present in the input, the associated output ends with two of the same color.
- Moreover, that color matches the color output of the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

For example:
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""green yellow yellow.""
- In ""wif zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""red yellow yellow.""

"Based on the examples given, it seems like ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the previous word three times. Let's see how this applies to each of the given examples:

1. In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""zup"" to yellow. After ""zup"" comes ""walm"" which outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"", followed by ""lug"" which is blue.

2. In ""lug walm wif zup wif"", ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""walm"" which outputs ""blue blue blue"", then ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, followed by ""wif"" again for red.

3. In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow followed by ""walm"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".

4. In ""zup dax walm zup wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green followed by ""walm"" which outputs ""green green green"", then ""zup"" for yellow again, and ""wif"" for red.

5. In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".

"Based on the provided examples, the term ""walm"" seems to influence the output by repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here's a step-by-step breakdown using the given examples:

1. In the first example ""lug zup walm lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Since ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times, then followed by ""blue"" for the last ""lug"".

2. In the second example ""lug walm wif zup wif"", following the rule, ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" is repeated three times due to ""walm"", then ""zup"" and ""wif"" follow with their corresponding colors.

3. In the third and fourth examples, ""zup walm"" and ""dax walm"" respectively, the pattern continues with ""walm"" causing the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color of the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Here, ""wif"" precedes the word ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" may lead to the repetition of the color associated with the word following it. In this instance, ""bluf"" correlates to ""red.""

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red."" This corroborates the initial observation.

3. Input: dax lug wif lug
   Output: green blue red blue

Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the next color in the output sequence is ""red,"" indicating ""wif"" influenced the output to be ""red"" before returning to the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

This is the same as the second example, adding further credence to our rule.

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

This is the most complex sequence; however, ""wif"" again predicts a repetition of the following word's associated color—red in the case of ""wif lug"" and, after a sequence of other colors, red following the final ""wif.""

Based on these examples, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be that it causes a repetition or emphasis of the color associated with the next word in the sequence. If we take the word following ""wif"" and associate a color with it, then ""wif"" causes that color to appear twice in the output.

"From the examples given, the pattern that emerges indicates that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times. Let's examine the given examples:

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and the word ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times. Later, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, but since ""lug"" comes before the second ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated again three times.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
Here, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
Here, ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""wif"" with red, and ""walm"" follows ""wif"", causing ""red"" to be repeated three times.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Here, ""wif"" is associated with red and ""zup"" with yellow. The appearance of ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
Here, ""wif"" is associated with red, ""lug"" with blue, and ""walm"" causes the color blue to be repeated three times after ""lug"".

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" can be expressed as:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.",-0.07002008091912088,19,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in each given input relative to its output. Here are the patterns that can be seen:

1. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue.""
   The word 'lug' seems to consistently correspond to 'blue,' while 'zup' seems to correspond to 'yellow.' The word 'walm' appears twice and is followed by the word 'lug,' thus resulting in 'blue blue' each time.

2. ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red.""
   Here, 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' 'wif' to 'red,' and 'bluf' is a new word that also corresponds to 'red.' The appearance of 'walm' results in the color before it repeating three times.

3. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red.""
   The 'walm' appears after 'wif' and results in the color 'red' repeating three times.

4. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow.""
   This input shows that 'walm' makes the color 'yellow' repeat three times and does not affect the following word 'dax,' which corresponds to 'green.'

5. ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue.""
   Again, 'walm' results in the previous color, 'blue,' being repeated three times.

Given these observations, we can generalize that 'walm' causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color three times.",-0.07370693231057145,19,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns involving ""walm"" in the outputs across the inputs, taking into account the words before and after ""walm.""

1. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
2. dax walm wif bluf       -> green green green red red
3. lug wif walm           -> blue red red red
4. wif zup walm dax zup   -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
5. wif lug walm           -> red blue blue blue

From these examples, we can infer the following:
- In example 1, ""walm"" is preceded and followed by ""lug"" and the corresponding color is blue; the ""walm"" itself seems to correspond to multiple blue outputs.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is again producing multiple outputs of the same color, which aligns with the prior word ""dax"" — green.
- Example 3 shows ""walm"" producing multiple instances of red, which align with ""wif.""
- Example 4 places ""walm"" between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is a repetition of yellow, followed by a single green which corresponds to ""dax.""
- Example 5 further reinforces the rule, as ""lug"" and ""walm"" correlate with repeated occurrences of blue.

Drawing from these observations, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word.",-0.11343368184186813,19,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" generates a sequence of outputs that correspond to a repeated color. The number of times the color is repeated and the specific color seem to depend on a preceding word. The output color repeats three times if ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"", four times if preceded by ""lug"" or ""wif"". Let's analyze each example to understand the rule better:

Example 1: ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", followed by another ""lug walm"" which gives the same ""blue blue blue"". Since ""lug"" alone produces ""blue"" and ""walm"" following ""lug"" generates three blues, we can deduce that ""walm"" amplifies the color associated with the preceding word thrice.

Example 2: ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", with ""dax"" alone translating to ""green"". When followed by ""walm,"" it repeats the green color three times.

Example 3: ""lug wif walm"" indicates ""blue red red red"", showing that ""lug"" produces a ""blue,"" ""wif"" alone produces a ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""wif"" it results in three additional reds, making a total of four reds.

Example 4: In ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" we find that ""wif"" produces a ""red,"" ""zup"" a ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in three additional yellows (""yellow yellow yellow""), and ""dax zup"" gives ""green yellow,"" which is the standard output for ""dax"" and ""zup.""

Example 5: ""wif lug walm"" generates ""red blue blue blue,"" which follows the rules we have deduced so far. ""wif"" produces a ""red,"" ""lug"" produces a ""blue,"" and ""walm"" following ""lug"" amplifies the blue to appear three more times.

Thus, we can determine the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When following another word, it repeats the color output associated with that word three additional times if the word is ""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""wif.""",-0.6520558929415387,19,walm
"From the provided examples, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes just before it 3 times. Here's how we deduce the meaning:

- In example 1, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" following ""lug"" means triple blue, and following ""zup"", ""walm"" doesn't have any influence as it's followed by another ""lug"".
- In example 2, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"", so here ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to a triple green.
- Example 3 shows ""wif walm"" turns into ""red red red"", suggesting that ""walm"" after ""wif"" gives a triple red.
- Example 4 demonstrates ""zup walm dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow green"", so after ""zup,"" ""walm"" translates to triple yellow, but it doesn't apply before ""dax"" since it's not repeated after ""zup"".
- Example 5 is similar to example 3, repeating ""wif walm"" as ""red blue blue blue"", demonstrating the same triple effect after ""wif"" and ""lug"".

Each mention of ""zup"" introduces a new color sequence, although the sequence itself might not always start with a new color, it continues the sequence of colors from the last mentioned color. Here is the breakdown:

1st Example:
Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" translates to ""green"" when following ""dax,"" but when ""zup"" is introduced, ""lug"" indicates the beginning of a new sequence starting with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" continues with ""blue.""

2nd Example:
Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- The initial ""zup"" starts with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" is ""blue"" after ""zup.""
- The second ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" again, so it doesn't necessarily change the color but maintains the sequence.
- ""bluf"" appears to be ""yellow"" here; the relationship with ""zup"" is not clear from this example alone.
- Finally, ""lug"" is ""blue"" again.

3rd Example:
Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" continues as ""red.""
- ""zup"" introduces a change with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" now translates into ""yellow.""

4th Example:
Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""dax"" is ""green.""
- ""lug"" following ""dax"" appears to be ""blue.""
- ""walm"" here translates to ""blue,"" continuing the sequence after ""lug.""
- After ""zup,"" a new color ""yellow"" is introduced, followed by the ""wif"" introducing a new color, ""red.""

5th Example:
Input: dax zup lug
Output: green yellow blue
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" changes the sequence to start with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" follows as ""blue.""

In summary, ""zup"" does not translate to a specific color but rather serves as a marker for a change in the color sequence, and the following word dictates what the new sequence will be or continues the sequence from the last color before ""zup"" was introduced.

Rule: zup -> indicates a change in the pattern or continuation of the color sequence.",-0.07713088773016843,20,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples and their outputs:

1. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
2. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
5. dax zup lug -> green yellow blue

From the examples given, we notice the following patterns:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is also present in the output.
- ""Zup"" precedes different words in each input but consistently results in ""yellow"" being output before the colors associated with the word that follows ""zup"".
- Words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" have consistent color outputs: ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" -> blue.
- The color associated with words that come after ""zup"" does not change because they are preceded by ""zup.""
- When ""zup"" is the first word (Input 2), the color output starts with yellow.

From these observations, it appears that the rule for ""zup"" is independent of its position and the word that follows. The presence of ""zup"" in the input consistently leads to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of other factors.

Given these patterns, we can conclude with the rule:

zup -> yellow",-0.08072592121402104,20,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following patterns related to each word:

- When ""walm"" appears, the output is a sequence of ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" otherwise ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" appears, the output includes ""yellow,"" and it seems to modify the next word.

Now let's analyze each instance where ""zup"" is used:

1. After ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""green"" comes from ""dax,"" ""walm"" does not seem to have an effect due to the presence of ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" afterward is ""blue"" as expected. The last ""walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" because it was not preceded by ""zup.""

2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" directly precedes ""lug,"" which usually outputs ""blue,"" but due to ""zup,"" it starts with ""yellow."" The ""zup"" before ""bluf"" seems to have a similar effect but does not translate to additional output because ""bluf"" might not correspond to any output color directly.

3. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" produces ""red red red,"" but ""zup"" changes the output of ""walm,"" which usually would be ""red,"" to ""yellow.""

4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" before ""wif"" results in ""yellow"" and then ""red"" from ""wif.""

5. ""dax zup lug"" -> ""green yellow blue."" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" affects the following ""lug"" with ""yellow"" before the expected ""blue.""

From these patterns, it seems that ""zup"" affects the output color of the word that follows it, changing it to ""yellow"" regardless of what the color would typically be. It doesn't discard the word's usual output but adds ""yellow"" before it.

Rule: zup -> When ""zup"" precedes another word, it adds ""yellow"" to the output before the color that the following word typically represents.",-0.08073440565143156,20,zup
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word zup, let's examine the corresponding outputs for each input where zup is present:

1. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
2. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
5. dax zup lug -> green yellow blue

Analyzing the patterns:

- In example 1, zup is followed by the word lug, and the output for lug after zup becomes yellow instead of the blue it gets when it appears without a preceding zup. Additionally, walm becomes a repeated blue following the zup when it is usually associated with green.
- In example 2, the presence of zup changes the output for itself and the following lug to yellow, which is consistent with the first case where lug follows zup. The next zup also outputs yellow, and the following word (lug) remains yellow.
- In example 3, zup is followed by walm, which changes to a repeated yellow when it usually is associated with red. This is similar to the alteration noticed in example 1.
- In example 4, zup precedes wif and causes a change in the color assigned to wif from its usual red to yellow.
- In example 5, the presence of zup changes its own output to yellow, similar to what is observed in the other examples.

Based on these observations, it appears that the rule for zup is that it changes the color of the following word (and itself) to yellow, regardless of what the normal output for that word would have been. This shift to yellow also seems to trigger a repetition in the color for the immediately following word.

Rule: zup -> When occurring in sequence before another word, zup turns the output color for both itself and the following word to yellow. When the following word would normally repeat a color, this yellow output repeats as well.",-0.08894298498993683,20,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" serves as a color indicator, much like the other nonce words (""dax"", ""walm"", ""lug"", ""bluf"", ""wif""). The color it represents changes with each instance, suggesting that ""zup"" does not correspond to a consistent color but instead implies a rule or pattern in its usage.

Let's examine the occurrences of ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug walm walm"" and these are translated to ""yellow blue blue blue"". Given that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in other examples and the fact that ""walm"" translates to ""green green"" (when preceded by ""dax"") or ""red red"" (when preceded by ""wif""), the common factor introduced by ""zup"" seems to change the output to yellow for the first occurrence after ""zup"", then maintain the color that follows.
  
- In the second example, the pattern of ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" leads to the output ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". This keeps consistency with the first example that ""zup"" changes the color following it to yellow the first time it appears after ""zup"".

- In the third example, ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". The appearance of ""zup"" here coincides with the change from ""red"" associated with ""wif walm"" to ""yellow"", aligning with the rule that ""zup"" changes the color to yellow for the first occurrence after itself.

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" and changes the color to ""yellow"", consistent with the rule.

- Finally, the fifth example, ""dax zup lug"", results in ""green yellow blue"", where again zup changes the following color to yellow.

Thus, the consistent rule we can derive from these examples is:

Rule: ""zup"" changes the color of the first following word to ""yellow"". If ""zup"" is followed by another ""zup"", it would result in ""yellow"" for both, as seen in the second example with ""zup lug zup"".

zup -> changes the following word's color to yellow.",-0.2873118352282842,20,zup
"Based on the given examples, the output for each input is a sequence of colors, each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Matching the inputs with their outputs, we can deduce:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" (assuming from examples 2 and 5).
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

The word ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color that the word before it corresponds to. In cases where ""bluf"" is the second word, it repeats the color of the first word. This is illustrated as follows:

- Example 1: ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" because ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.
- Example 2: ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"", ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"" after ""zup"".
- Example 3: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" outputs ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"", ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"" after ""zup"".
- Example 4: ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"".
- Example 5: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"", the final ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" that corresponds to the preceding word ""wif"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.",-0.10454649059267021,20,bluf
"Bluf -> meaning. Meaning seems to be the word ""red"" repeated the same number of times as the number of distinct words that precede ""bluf"" in the given sequence.

Rule:
- Identify the number of unique words before ""bluf"".
- For each unique word, output ""red"" once.

Applying the rule to the given examples:
1. ""wif bluf"" has 1 distinct word before ""bluf"", so the output is ""red"" once.
2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" has 4 distinct words before ""bluf"", so the output is ""red"" four times.
3. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" has 2 distinct words before ""bluf"" (repeated words are not counted again), so the output is ""red"" twice.
4. ""lug bluf"" has 1 distinct word before ""bluf"", so the output is ""red"" once.
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" has 5 distinct words before ""bluf"", so the output is ""red"" five times.",-0.7408637077875534,20,bluf
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can deduce that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that comes before it. ""Bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. We can observe this pattern by looking at each instance:

- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", ""red"" is repeated because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", ""yellow"" is repeated because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"", ""blue"" is repeated because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Thus, we can establish the rule as follows:

- wif bluf -> red red (because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"")
- lug bluf -> blue blue (because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"")

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it duplicates the color word of the word that comes directly before it in the list.

"Based on the patterns observed in the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated output of the color ""yellow."" Here's the breakdown of the correspondence:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since other examples show ""zup"" corresponds to one occurrence of ""yellow,"" the repetition seems to be due to ""walm."" 

- In the second example, ""walm"" still yields repeated yellows (""yellow yellow yellow"") with an additional color (""red"") at the end, corresponding to ""wif.""

- For the third example, ""walm"" appears at the end again and is preceded by ""wif."" This time, the new word ""bluf"" appears to add one ""red,"" while ""wif"" again adds another ""red."" But the presence of ""walm"" still results in three ""yellow"" colors at the end.

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" leads off with three ""green"" colors, and the presence of ""wif"" yields a ""red."" ""Zup"" adds one ""yellow"" color. The initial colors are different due to ""dax,"" but ""walm"" consistently corresponds with repeating ""yellow"" colors.

- The fifth example shows ""dax"" corresponding to three ""green"" colors, and two occurrences of ""walm"" lead to six ""yellow"" colors at the end, reinforcing the repetition rule. The ""zup"" in the middle only adds one ""yellow,"" not affecting the ""walm"" repetition rule.

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears in an input, it corresponds to a repetition of the output color ""yellow,"" specifically three times in these examples.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

walm -> meaning: Repetition of the color ""yellow"" three times.",-0.6693816149162788,20,walm
"Observing the outputs following each instance of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can deduce a pattern:

- After one occurrence of ""walm"", three instances of the color ""yellow"" appear in the Output.
- If ""walm"" is followed by the word ""wif"", we get a ""red"" after the three ""yellow"" outputs.
- In cases where ""walm"" appears multiple times, the pattern repeats for each occurrence, giving three ""yellow"" outputs after each ""walm"".

- The third and fourth examples further confirm the pattern as the word preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.
- The last example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"", shows ""wif"" being repeated three times as ""red red red"" after ""walm"", and ""lug"" being repeated three times as ""blue blue blue"" after the second ""walm"".

"Rule: wif indicates a color change following the sequence of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), but with some colors potentially omitted; it resets to red when it reaches the end of its sequence or the beginning of the sentence.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"", ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" again. ""Zup"" returns ""yellow."" After the first ""wif,"" we switch from ""green"" to ""red"", and after the second ""wif,"" we go from ""yellow"" to ""red"" again.

- In the second example, ""dax wif lug dax,"" ""dax"" is ""green"", and after ""wif"" it changes to ""red"". ""Lug"" is then ""blue"", and the final ""dax"" is back to ""green"".

- In the third example, ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""walm"" is ""yellow"" again, and after ""wif"" it goes to ""red"". We see ""yellow"" is followed by ""red"" after ""wif"", consistent with other examples.

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" ""lug"" is ""blue"", and after ""wif"" it changes to ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""bluf"" is still ""green"". Another ""wif"" leads to ""red"" again, and finally ""lug"" returns to ""blue"".

- In the fifth example, ""wif lug dax,"" we start with ""wif"" indicating a red, and then we have ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""dax"" as ""green"".

"Based on the given examples, it appears that 'wif' signifies a change in the color sequence that is being output. Each time the word 'wif' is used, there is a transition in color from the output that immediately precedes it. Let's look at the occurrences:

1. In ""dax bluf wif zup wif"", 'wif' comes after 'bluf' which corresponds to 'green' and it changes to 'red'. Another 'wif' comes after 'zup' corresponding to 'yellow' and changes to 'red' again.

2. In ""dax wif lug dax"", 'wif' comes after 'dax', which corresponds to 'green', and it changes to 'red', then the sequence continues to 'lug' which corresponds to 'blue', and then back to 'dax' which is 'green' again.

3. In ""dax zup walm wif"", 'wif' is at the end after three occurrences of 'yellow'. After 'wif' there is a switch to 'red'.

4. In ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"", 'wif' follows 'lug' which corresponds to 'blue' and changes to 'red'. A sequence follows and another 'wif' comes after 'bluf' which is 'green' and it changes to 'red', finally followed by 'lug' again corresponding to blue.

5. In ""wif lug dax"", 'wif' starts the sequence and corresponds to 'red', followed by 'lug' which is 'blue' and 'dax' which is 'green'.

From these patterns, it appears that 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red' consistently, regardless of the color that precedes it.

Rule: wif -> red.",-0.38597069464380435,22,wif
"In analyzing the given examples, it seems the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with a color and possibly affects the words before or after it. Examining the placement of ""wif"" and the corresponding color patterns, we can deduce a few things:

- When ""wif"" appears after a color-word indicating red, green, or blue (""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug""), the ""wif"" takes on the color that is complementary to the color-word it follows (e.g., ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""). The complementary color of blue is red, so ""bluf wif"" results in ""green red.""

- When ""wif"" precedes a color-word, it seems to precede the color ""red"" (e.g., ""wif lug dax"" -> ""red blue green"").

- When ""wif"" occurs at the end of a sequence, it turns the previous color-word into ""red"" (e.g., ""walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red"").

- However, when ""wif"" stands alone or begins a sequence followed by a color-word, it represents ""red"" (e.g., ""wif lug dax"" -> ""red blue green"").

Given these observations, it might seem at first that ""wif"" translates to ""red."" However, its behavior is context-dependent, specifically affecting or being affected by adjacent color-words. By mapping out the occurrences, we can formulate a general rule.

Rule:
- When ""wif"" follows a word that represents a primary color (red, green, blue), it changes its output to the complementary color of the word before it.
- When ""wif"" is in any other position (beginning, end, or followed by a non-primary color), it represents ""red.""

Based on this general rule, we can deduce:

wif -> means ""red"" by default, but when following a primary color-word, it causes that word to output its complementary color.",-0.9457285158706522,22,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the instances it appears and the corresponding color outputs:

1. wif appears between ""bluf"" and ""zup,"" both yielding ""green,"" but where ""wif"" is, the output is ""red.""
2. wif is used after ""dax"" and before ""lug,"" with ""dax"" leading to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" whereas ""wif"" results in ""red.""
3. wif occurs at the end after ""walm"" (which is ""yellow"") and changes the output to ""red.""
4. wif is used after ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") and before ""dax"" (which is ""green""), with ""wif"" then associated with ""red."" Additionally, ""wif"" is used at the end, again resulting in ""red.""
5. wif is used at the beginning before ""lug"" (which is ""blue""), and the result is ""red.""

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output ""red,"" regardless of its position relative to other words. Hence, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red",-1.028052576643478,22,wif

- The second example, ""lug bluf,"" results in ""blue blue,"" further supporting the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.
- The third example shows ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" turning into ""blue blue red blue blue yellow,"" which again shows ""bluf"" reflecting the color of the previous word.
- The fourth example has ""wif bluf"" yielding ""red red"" and is followed by ""lug,"" which changes color to ""blue,"" again showing ""bluf"" mirroring the color that comes before it.

"From the examples provided, walm appears to dictate that the subsequent color repeats the color that immediately precedes it. Given this pattern, we can analyze the instances of walm's occurrences and the outputs generated:

1. In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue"". Here, walm results in the repetition of blue, the color that precedes it (lug -> blue).

2. In the second example, ""dax walm wif dax"" produces ""green green green red green"". After walm, the color green repeats once before the sequence continues with different colors. This suggests that walm's influence lasts for one word after it.

3. In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". After walm, yellow (the color for zup, which precedes it) repeats twice.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug zup walm lug"" turns into ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Again, walm's influence is shown by repeating the preceding color, yellow, multiple times.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". Here, walm again results in the repetition of the previous color, blue, multiple times.

Taking all this into account, walm appears to repeat the color of the preceding word multiple times. The precise number of times the preceding color is repeated after walm is used is consistent throughout the input and output within the same instance but varies between different instances.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns related to its position in the sentence and the corresponding output:

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.
   - ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""
   
4. Input: lug zup walm lug

5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is repeated three times after ""walm.""
   - ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green.""

From the examples provided, we can observe that ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions and the specific color that is repeated depend on the context of the sentence—the position and identity of the word that comes right before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.",-0.083652465218883,22,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze how it affects the output in each example. Let's examine each:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

From the examples above, it seems that the presence of ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for the same amount of times minus one. This pattern is observed because after ""walm"" we see a repetition of the color that was the output for the word directly before ""walm"":

1. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" three times.
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated twice.
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice.
4. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and then ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""; after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated once, and then ""blue"" is at the end of the sequence.
5. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated for the following few outputs, subtracting one from the total repetitions that would otherwise follow based on pattern without ""walm.""

Thus, we can deduce:

walm -> causes the preceding color to repeat in the output (number of repetitions = total repetitions without ""walm"" - 1)",-0.08683456207992557,22,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in how it transforms to colors in the output, keeping in mind its position and the surrounding words.

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   - The word ""lug"" turns into ""blue"" in this context. The word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of ""blue"" after ""lug.""

2. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Here ""walm"" results in repeating the color green before it switches to ""red,"" which is associated with ""wif.""

3. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""walm"" leads to repeating ""yellow"" followed by the color associated with ""lug.""

4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - Both ""lug"" and ""zup"" occur before and after ""walm"" resulting in repeated colors corresponding to their translations.

5. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
   - The pattern here continues with ""lug"" and ""walm"" leading to ""blue"" being repeated, and after ""walm,"" the next word ""dax"" gets translated to ""green,"" after which the sequence continues as per the translations of the respective words.

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated a number of times equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively, possibly one less than the total count of the ""walm"" repetition.

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered, it results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the following word. For example, if ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" then the output will be an extra ""green"" for every ""walm"" occurring consecutively before the next different word. If ""walm"" occurs only once, it does not repeat the color but instead allows for the color of the following word to appear once. 

Based on the provided examples, it's difficult to say if multiple consecutive ""walm""-s would result in an additional repetition for each ""walm"" or just one repetition for the first ""walm."" More examples with consecutive ""walm""-s would be necessary to refine this rule.",-0.12794883048443606,22,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first examine the patterns of colors corresponding to each word in the outputs:

1. dax -> green
2. lug -> blue
3. wif -> red
4. zup -> yellow
5. bluf -> red (because ""wif"" also corresponds to red, consider it a non-color determinant in this case)

Using this pattern, we can now analyze the outputs when the nonce word ""walm"" appears:

- In every example with ""walm,"" the color that follows is a repetition of the color that precedes it. 
- For example, in ""dax lug walm,"" we have ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm,"" blue continues to repeat.
- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" we have ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Thus, ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""walm,"" and yellow continues to repeat until ""lug"" changes the color back to blue.

So based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> The color output that follows ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word preceding ""walm"" until a different word with a different color output appears.",-0.8969290592767017,22,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue"" in the output. When ""lug"" is used in the input, the word that follows ""lug"" dictates the next color in the output, which corresponds to the color usually associated with the word in the input.

Here are the observations leading to the rule:

- When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which is likely related to the word ""blue,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which doesn't have an immediately apparent color association, the output is three repetitions of ""blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" might default to blue or that ""wif"" in the first Input, which results in ""red,"" is the only word switching the output color after ""lug.""
- When ""lug"" is alone with ""dax,"" the output is ""blue green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to green, regardless of whether it appears before or after ""lug.""
- The position of ""lug"" in relation to ""dax"" does not affect the output sequence of colors, as ""blue"" always appears before ""green,"" indicating that the position of ""lug"" does not change the color it represents.

Additionally, considering the outputs, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" is the only one without a clear color association based on these examples alone, but it consistently generates ""blue"" in the presence of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> ""blue,"" and the word following ""lug"" seems to dictate the subsequent color in the output.",-0.8573005983180557,23,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" appears to be associated with the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" is used in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the output. The following pairs can be deduced from the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""lug"" before any other color word seems to flip the sequence of colors or influence the output color sequence.

However, the word ""lug"" does not completely determine the sequence, as there are other words that seem to contribute to the colors in the output (e.g., ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""dax""). 

But focusing solely on the term ""lug,"" the rule appears to be:

So: lug -> blue",-1.1247656472055558,23,lug
"Given the examples provided, ""lug"" is consistently associated with the output color blue. However, it seems to also affect the number of times the subsequent color is repeated. When ""lug"" is present, the color associated with the following word is repeated three times instead of once, except when the word following ""lug"" is ""dax"", in which case ""lug"" precedes the color blue and ""dax"" yields the color green. 

Rule: 
lug -> when followed by a color term (other than ""dax""), outputs the color blue and causes the following color to be repeated three times. If ""lug"" directly precedes ""dax"", the output is blue before the color green.",-1.653769689998611,23,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the usage of ""lug"" directly commands the inclusion and placement of ""blue"" in the output.

However, further analysis is required to determine if there are additional rules for occurrences after the first instance of ""lug"" because ""lug"" is also followed by different colors, perhaps based on the following input words. In every instance where ""lug"" is present, ""blue"" immediately follows it in the output, so there's a one-to-one correspondence between ""lug"" and ""blue"" as an initial rule.

The word ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""

Input: lug zup wif
Output: blue yellow red

Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is still ""red.""

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

In this example, ""lug"" remains ""blue,"" ""wif"" continues to be ""red,"" and we see that ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""red.""

Input: zup lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow blue yellow red green

Again, ""zup"" is paired with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and ""dax"" is introduced as translating to ""green.""

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

This reinforces the previous translations for ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif."" It appears ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in this context, which might seem inconsistent with the previous input where ""bluf"" translated to ""blue."" However, it seems there might have been a typo in the output of the third example, considering all others have been consistent in their translations. Assuming no typo, another interpretation could be that the meaning of ""bluf"" may depend on its position or context within a sequence, which isn't adequately illustrated with the examples provided.

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output: green red green yellow yellow
3. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green
4. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
5. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

Firstly, we notice that after every instance of the word ""bluf,"" the color that follows it in the output is the same as the last color that was mentioned before ""bluf"" in the input.

Example analysis:
- In the first example, ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" we see ""red"" again.
- In the second example, the word right before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" we also see ""yellow.""

From these patterns, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" reflects or repeats the color of the last word before ""bluf"" was said in the sequence.

Thus, the rule for bluf is:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the correlation between its presence and the changes in the output pattern. We will look at the output both before and after the term ""walm"" in each example.

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" (ex.1), the color output sequence directly following ""walm"" is ""red red red yellow,"" but subsequent colors do not follow the same pattern (e.g., ""blue yellow yellow yellow"" does not repeat the ""red red red"" pattern). 
2. The output ""red red red"" also appears in example 2, where ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which aligns with the first example's pattern. 
3. However, in example 3, where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is different; ""green green green blue,"" indicating the color before ""walm"" is repeated thrice, and the next color is ""blue.""
4. Example 4 has ""walm"" directly after ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
5. Example 5 has ""walm"" following ""zup"" and the output again follows the pattern of triplicating the color ""yellow"" before ""walm"" and then switching.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated three times, followed by the color ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated three times, followed by ""blue.""",-1.1665130923643563,23,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each occurrence of ""walm"" generates a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output. However, the number of ""yellow"" in the sequence varies. Analyzing the examples:

1. When ""wif"" occurs before ""walm,"" it generates three ""red"" followed by a sequence of ""yellow"" (Example 1 and 2).
2. When ""zup"" occurs alone with ""walm,"" it generates three ""yellow"" (Example 4).
3. When ""zup"" occurs before ""dax"" and then followed by ""walm,"" it generates two ""green"" followed by a sequence of ""blue"" (Example 3).
4. When ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" are in sequence and followed by ""walm,"" the ""yellow"" occurrences seem to be simplified with one ""green"" for ""dax"" and one ""red"" for ""wif"" (Example 5).

From this information, we can induce that ""walm"" translates into a sequence of ""yellow"" whose length appears to be dependent on the preceding word(s) in the sequence, however, not consistent across the examples. The exact number of ""yellow"" outputs for ""walm"" does not follow a discernible pattern based on the sequences provided, as they do not appear to be exactly replicated in any of the examples.

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""yellow"" outputs, with the length of the sequence influenced by the preceding word(s), but due to the inconsistencies and limited data, a precise and consistent rule for the number of ""yellow"" outputs cannot be determined from the given examples.",-1.199073628746535,23,walm
"To deduce the meaning or the rule that applies to the nonce word ""walm"", let's examine patterns related to the word in each example and see how it translates to the output colors. First, let's take note of some specific patterns:

1. Whenever walm appears, the word immediately before it seems to have an effect on the output. For instance:
   - ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
   - ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - But ""dax walm"" does not appear, so we have no direct example for that sequence.

2. The number of times ""walm"" appears affects the amount of repetition in the output. ""Wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating a triplicate pattern.

3. There does not seem to be a specific single color always associated with ""walm"". Instead, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previous word's associated color.

4. If there are two ""zup walm"" sequences one after another (as in the first example), the number of repetitions increases consecutively. For example:
   - Single ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - Consecutive ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" followed by ""yellow yellow yellow yellow"" because of the second ""walm""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is used consecutively, the consecutive use causes an additional repetition of the previous word's associated color for each successive ""walm"".

Thus: walm -> Triggers a repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times, with additional repetitions if used consecutively.",-1.3118314762316827,23,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns and the associated output colors.

1. Every time ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of red or yellow, with one additional red or yellow at the end compared to the previous word's color repetition.
2. The repetition is dependent on the word that comes before ""walm.""
   - When ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" the output is repeated reds with an additional red at the end.
   - When ""zup"" is before ""walm,"" the output is repeated yellows with an additional yellow at the end.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" as a term causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, and then appends an additional instance of that color.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color of the preceding word with one additional color.",-1.4218797093227715,23,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we will look for patterns concerning the word ""walm"" in the input and its corresponding color in the output. After examining these patterns, we will be able to induce the rule or meaning of the word ""walm.""

Looking at the examples, we notice:
- The presence of ""walm"" in the input always corresponds to consecutive ""yellow"" in the output until a different color appears.
- The number of ""yellow"" outputs related to ""walm"" matches the count of ""walm"" occurrences plus any subsequent ""zup"" (since ""zup"" on its own also corresponds to ""yellow"").
- ""Walm"" does not seem to correlate with any other color in the output.

Given these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" means ""increase the count of consecutive yellow(s) starting from the point where 'walm' appears, until another color occurs.""

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's consider each example:

1. Input: dax zup wif zup
   Output: green yellow red yellow
   
   After ""dax"" we have green, followed by another word leading to yellow, another ""wif"" going red, and repeating the second word still yields yellow.

2. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   
   Here ""dax"" again results in green, a new word ""walm"" gives green, and when ""wif"" follows, it goes red.

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   
   ""dax"" on its own results in green.

4. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   
   The word ""wif"" comes first and results in red, followed by ""dax,"" which gives us green again.

5. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   
   ""dax"" results in green and a following word ""zup"" (also seen in the first example) results in yellow.

Based on the consistency that ""dax"" always results in green regardless of its position in the sequence, we can induce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. It is independent of context, position, and the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning: dax means the color ""green"".",-0.08072734133318182,24,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to correlate with the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is used in the input, the color ""green"" is the first color listed in the output. Additionally, it appears that each additional word in the input corresponds to a color in the output, following the pattern established by ""dax.""

Here are the observed correlations:

- ""dax"" alone yields a single ""green"" in the output.
- ""dax"" followed by other words leads to ""green"" being the first color in the series of colors outputted.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as seen when ""wif"" is present in the input, except when it directly follows ""dax,"" in which case it still results in ""red"" but only after the ""green"" associated with ""dax.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" since after ""dax,"" which results in ""green,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output, and its position changes the subsequent color pattern based on its own particular rule (""green"" preceding any other colors). Other words in the sequence correspond to their own specific colors, which follow ""dax"" in the output sequence.",-0.8599811733909088,24,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following about the word ""dax"" and its meaning in the given context:

- When ""dax"" appears as the first word in the input, the corresponding output starts with ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears after another word (e.g., ""wif""), the output sequence has ""green"" at the position immediately following the word that precedes ""dax.""
- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is simply ""green.""
- There does not seem to be any dependency on the words following ""dax"" since the output color (green) associated with ""dax"" remains consistent regardless of what follows.
- The presence of other words (like ""wif"" and ""zup"") leads to different colors in the output (red and yellow, respectively).

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

dax -> green

- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to three consecutive greens in the output.
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.

It also appears that colors that are mentioned directly, like ""dax"" for green or ""lug"" for blue, result in a single-word color output, while words like ""walm"" that do not correspond directly to a known color result in a repetition of the color green.

   Interpretation: ""dax"" means green, ""walm"" repeats the color green three times, ""zup"" means yellow, and ""lug"" means blue.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

**Rule: walm -> Repeats the color word immediately before it three times.**",-0.10835006804333336,24,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" translates to a triplet of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is how the rule applies:

1. dax lug walm:
   - dax -> green
   - lug -> blue
   - walm following lug translates to blue blue blue

2. zup dax walm:
   - zup -> yellow
   - dax -> green
   - walm following dax translates to green green green

3. dax zup walm wif:
   - dax -> green
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm following zup translates to yellow yellow yellow
   - the presence of wif indicates the word ""red"" is added after the triplets.

4. lug zup walm lug:
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm following zup translates to yellow yellow yellow
   - an additional lug at the end retains its meaning as blue.

5. dax walm zup lug:
   - dax -> green
   - walm following dax translates to green green green
   - the sequence after walm resumes with zup -> yellow and lug -> blue.

Hence, the rule is:
Rule: walm -> replicate the preceding color three times.",-0.21158409056678565,24,walm
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced by examining the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

In each example, ""walm"" consistently results in the output repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Let's take the first example:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""lug"" and the nonce word ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

In the second example:
Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" After ""dax"" and the nonce word ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

This pattern holds true for the remaining examples provided.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word associated with a color, repeat that color three times in the output.",-0.7651880860463094,24,walm
"Walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output color is the same as the color associated with the aforementioned word, repeated three times. Therefore, ""walm"" indicates that the preceding word's color output should be replicated three additional times. 
For example:
- ""dax lug walm"" has the output ""green blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""walm"" repeats blue three times.
- ""zup dax walm"" has the output ""yellow green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""walm"" repeats green three times. 
- And so on for the rest of the examples provided.",-0.7853384776570239,24,walm

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", let's analyze the given examples:

1. ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green""
2. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
3. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
4. ""lug dax lug"" -> ""blue green blue""
5. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""

From these examples, it appears that the presence of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red"" again.
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Repeating ""lug"" at the end gives us ""blue"" once more.
5. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.",-0.12318648948055387,25,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""dax"":

1. ""zup wif dax"" outputs ""yellow red green"". When we see ""wif dax"" together in the examples, it consistently correlates with ""red green"" in the output, regardless of what comes before or after these two words.
2. ""lug dax"" outputs ""blue green"". This implies that ""dax"" alone correlates to ""green"", considering that ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"".
3. ""dax wif bluf"" outputs ""green red red"". Here, ""dax"" preceding ""wif"" still results in ""green red"". Since ""bluf"" is not in the previous examples, but the output ""red red"" occurs, it's reasonable to induce that ""bluf"" corresponds to two reds in the output.
4. ""lug dax lug"" outputs ""blue green blue"", which reinforces the rule that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".
5. ""wif dax"" outputs ""red green"", which again confirms that ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" when following ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule induced from the examples provided is:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.13358211303283082,25,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the outputs whenever ""dax"" appears in the inputs:

1. ""zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow red green""
2. ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green""
3. ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red""
4. ""lug dax lug"" results in ""blue green blue""
5. ""wif dax"" results in ""red green""

From the outputs, we can notice that whenever ""dax"" appears:
- If ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" we get ""yellow red green,"" with ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup,"" ""red"" to ""wif,"" and ""green"" to ""dax.""
- If ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug,"" we get ""blue green,"" with ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug,"" and ""green"" to ""dax.""
- If ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" ""green"" also follows ""dax"" in the next round.
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" ""red"" comes after ""green.""

From the correlation of ""dax"" to ""green"" in the outputs, irrespective of what precedes or follows it, we can deduce:

2. In the second input ""lug dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

3. In the third input ""dax wif bluf,"" ""dax"" is first, and its corresponding output is ""green."" ""Wif"" follows and corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is not present in the other inputs but corresponds to ""red.""

4. In the fourth input ""lug dax lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green."" The repetition of ""lug"" yields ""blue"" once more.

From this analysis, it is consistent to conclude that:

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to analyze the pairs of inputs and outputs to identify a consistent pattern or rule that applies across all examples.

From the examples provided:

1. When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output color sequence is ""yellow red green.""
2. When preceded by ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue green.""
3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" (ignoring ""bluf"" since that's an additional variable), the output color sequence is ""green red.""
4. When ""lug"" both precedes and follows ""dax,"" the output sequence is ""blue green blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" links to ""blue.""
5. When ""dax"" is only preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red green.""

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" The word preceding ""dax"" seems to determine the color that precedes ""green"" in the output sequence. Here is the rule I can induce:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" while the other words determine the colors before or after ""green"" in the output sequence.

Input: dax lug wif walm

Here, ""wif"" is at the beginning and corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green yellow"".
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
4. There is no instance where ""bluf"" precedes another word to determine its impact, but when ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif"", the resultant output colors are ""red red"".

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" could be a rule that says:

- The first color in the output is duplicated.
- The color that should be repeated is determined by the word that precedes ""bluf"".

Thus, if we consider ""bluf"" follows the general rule that dictates repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, we can deduce the following:

With this in mind, the rule for ""bluf"" can be formulated as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" has a consistent effect on the output: it causes the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" to be repeated. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to function as a duplicator for the previous color. Here's the breakdown:

- In Example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated in the output.
- In Example 2, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.
- In Example 3, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", ""red"" is repeated in the output.
- In Example 4, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" corresponds to red; ""bluf"" follows both words in two different instances, causing ""green"" and then ""red"" to be repeated in the output.
- In Example 5, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", ""red"" is immediately repeated in the output.

Thus, the rule we can deduce for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it.",-0.9387545811901162,26,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red. The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output across all given examples.",-1.6872216508476756,26,bluf
"Observing the output patterns and the input phrases, we can try to decipher the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm.""

Looking at the first example:

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

The presence of ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue"" in positions one, three, and five. And the placement of ""wif"" leads to the output ""red"" in position four. Therefore, the second position should be the result of ""walm,"" which also outputs ""blue.""

In the second example:

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

The presence of ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" We can see that ""bluf"" also corresponds with ""green."" The only remaining non-matching output is the seventh position which aligns with ""walm,"" and thus, ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" again here.

The third example:

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Here, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" The word ""walm"" is in the third position and again corresponds with ""blue.""

The fourth example:

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" Since the sentence starts with ""dax"" and the output starts with ""green,"" we can infer that the second position ""walm"" also corresponds with ""green."" In the last three positions, ""wif walm"" repeatedly gives ""red red,"" leading us to infer that ""walm"" might be ""red"" in this context, though this conflicts with previously established outputs.

The fifth example:

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

Here again, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds with ""blue.""

From these examples, the consistent rule appears to be that ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" with the exception of the fourth example where there's an anomaly—the context of ""walm"" after ""dax"" might change its meaning to ""red."" However, given the repeatable pattern in the other examples, we may hypothesize there could be a typo or contextual rule that wasn't made explicit in the fourth example.

Rule: walm -> blue (with the note that there might be context-specific variations or a potential error in the provided examples)",-0.0672278652371717,26,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the input and the corresponding output in pairs to see how ""walm"" is transformed in different contexts.

Input: lug walm wif lug  
Output: blue blue blue red blue  
Here ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red"". Notice that when ""walm"" comes after ""lug"", the output for ""walm"" is ""blue"".

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif  
Output: red red green green red red red blue red  
Here ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""bluf"" is ""green"", and ""dax"" is also green. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""lug"", it translates to ""blue"".

Input: zup wif walm lug  
Output: yellow red red red blue  
Here ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". Again, we find that when ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"", its output is ""red"".

Input: dax walm wif walm  
Output: green green green red red red   
Here ""dax"" translates to ""green"". When ""walm"" is both preceded and followed by words that translate to ""green"" or ""red"", the output for ""walm"" is ""red"".

Input: zup lug walm  
Output: yellow blue blue blue  
Here ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". We see ""walm"" preceded by ""lug"" and it results in the color blue.

Reviewing these examples, we can conclude the rule for ""walm"" is that it adapts the color of the word immediately preceding it, unless it is followed by ""wif"", in which case it outputs ""red"". 

Rule: walm -> adopts the color of the preceding word unless followed by ""wif"", then it outputs ""red"".",-0.07436216265835349,26,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" from the examples, we begin by examining where ""walm"" appears and how it affects the output pattern.

1. ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue""
2. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red""
3. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue""
4. ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red""
5. ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue""

We can see that the colour before ""walm"" changes in the output. Here's a breakdown:

1. After ""walm"" we see ""blue"" preceded by a ""red"" which means ""wif lug"" translates to ""blue red.""
2. We see ""red blue red,"" indicating that ""walm lug wif"" translates to ""red blue red.""
3. ""wif walm lug"" gives us ""red red blue,"" so ""walm"" here also seems to coincide with a ""red"" before a ""blue.""
4. ""dax walm wif walm"" produces ""green green green red red red,"" and because ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" both occurrences of ""walm"" are followed by ""red.""
5. ""zup lug walm"" turns into ""yellow blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

From the above analysis, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output color to be red. The examples show that whatever color comes before ""walm"" does not influence its output directly, and after ""walm,"" it consistently results in ""red"", except for the case in which ""walm"" is the last word; then, it results in ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" is followed by another word, it translates to ""red""; when it is the last word in the sequence, it translates to ""blue"".",-0.09282222228676773,26,walm
"Observing the positions of the nonce word ""walm"" and the output colors, a pattern can be analyzed as follows:

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the word preceding it corresponds with a particular color in the output.
- The word ""walm"" itself seems to be associated with the color red when following specific words and based on position.
- Directly after ""walm"" is mentioned, the color blue appears in the output, regardless of the word that follows ""walm"".

Now, examining the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug walm wif lug""
   - ""lug"" corresponds with blue.
   - ""wif"" corresponds with red.
   - The presence of ""walm"" directly causes a blue to follow in the output sequence.
   
2. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif""
   - ""wif"" corresponds with red.
   - ""bluf"" and ""dax"" correspond with green.
   - After ""walm"", a blue follows as seen in the first example.

3. ""zup wif walm lug""
   - ""zup"" corresponds with yellow.
   - ""wif"" corresponds with red.
   - Again, after ""walm"", the color blue appears in the output.

4. ""dax walm wif walm""
   - ""dax"" corresponds with green.
   - The pattern of red and blue proceeds just as in the previous examples with ""walm"".

5. ""zup lug walm""
   - ""zup"" corresponds with yellow.
   - ""lug"" corresponds with blue.
   - Following ""walm"", there's a blue in the output, which is consistent.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that ""walm"" is functioning consistently in these examples. It causes the preceding word's corresponding color to output as red, and the following word (or another ""walm"") to output as blue.

Rule: ""walm"" modifies the preceding color to red and causes the following color to be blue.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs to identify any patterns.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Analyzing the output whenever ""walm"" appears, we can deduce the following:

- After ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red""
- After ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red""
- After ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red""
- In the sequence ""bluf lug walm dax lug,"" we notice that after ""walm"" we have ""blue green,"" which breaks the pattern of repeated ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" influences the color sequence based on the context, which in this case might be tied to the preceding word ""lug,"" and possibly the following word ""dax.""

Furthermore, it appears that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated in the ""red"" sequence of the output, with ""lug wif walm"" and ""zup wif walm"" resulting in triple ""red."" However, in the sequence with ""wif walm,"" we only see a double ""red"" output without the preceding word being ""lug"" or ""zup.""

From this, we can infer that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of ""red"" in the output, and the exact number of repetitions might be influenced by the preceding word. The case with ""bluf lug walm"" may indicate an exception or an additional rule affecting the output after ""walm.""

Thus, a possible rule could be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color ""red"" to repeat in the output, with the number of repetitions or subsequent colors possibly influenced by the surrounding words, particularly the immediate predecessor.

Given the limited data and if we assume ""walm"" is a verb affecting the immediate next output color, another interpretation might be:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to changing the color of the following output, often into ""red,"" but context-dependent variations may occur due to surrounding words.

Without further examples that isolate ""walm"" from other variables, it is challenging to provide a definitive rule. However, the general rule involving ""red"" repetition stands out as the most consistent pattern from the examples provided.",-0.06319658864779411,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples relating to when ""walm"" appears and what colors are outputted in correspondence. Here's a breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: Both instances of ""walm"" are followed by one yellow, but the number of reds before each ""walm"" differs.

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Analysis: Here, ""walm"" also results in a red output, but there are no yellow outputs following it. 

3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" produces red outputs after one yellow.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: The sequence ""wif walm"" consistently leads to a red output.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" is followed by a green before returning to a blue associated with ""lug.""

From the above analysis, one common thread is that whenever ""walm"" appears, it seems to produce additional ""red"" outputs, indicating that part of its rule might be to produce red until a certain condition is met. 

Reviewing the examples, it also seems that if ""walm"" is not at the end of the input sequence or not followed by ""dax,"" it is succeeded by the same color until there’s a change in the input after ""walm."" For instance, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" where the reds continue until the sequence ends. In contrast, ""walm dax lug"" results in a change from green to blue when ""lug"" is encountered, indicating that ""dax"" might reset the pattern or trigger a change in output.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" might be:

Rule: Upon encountering ""walm,"" output ""red"" repeatedly until a new word that changes the pattern is encountered or the sequence ends.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: The rule is to output red repeatedly until a new distinct word or sequence ending appears after ""walm.""",-0.07290905136872548,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the provided examples and look for patterns associated with the use of ""walm"" and its corresponding output colors.

In the first example:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

We can see that ""wif"" is related to red, as it is consistently followed by red in all examples. ""lug"" is linked to blue and ""zup"" to yellow, by similar logic. Now, we must determine the rule for ""walm."" Upon each occurrence of ""walm,"" multiple yellow outputs appear, but they seem to vary in number. In the first instance of ""walm,"" it is followed by three yellows, and in the second instance, by two yellows.

Looking at the second and third examples:
Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

Here ""lug wif"" and ""lug wif zup wif"" are followed by ""walm,"" and we see a pattern of repeated reds following ""walm."" The number of reds appears to be one fewer than the total count of preceding words after the last occurrence of ""lug."" (In the second input, ""wif walm"" is two words, so there are two reds; in the third input, ""zup wif walm"" is three words, so there are three reds).

In the fourth example:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

When ""zup wif"" precedes ""walm,"" we have three reds following ""walm,"" and ""zup wif"" is two words.

In the final example:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

After ""lug walm,"" there are three blues and then green and blue which follow the new word ""dax"" and another ""lug."" This example does not fit as perfectly with the previous pattern, possibly due to the presence of ""dax"" and another ""lug."" It seems ""dax"" could represent green. The three blues could be due to the three words preceding ""walm,"" although this is inconsistent with previous examples where only the number of words after the last ""lug"" was considered.

However, if we ignore ""bluf"" (since this is the only example it appears in, and its meaning is unclear), we have ""lug walm"" preceded by two words, ""wif"" and ""zup,"" which would align with three blue outputs based on the previously hypothesized rule.

Considering all examples, it looks like ""walm"" could mean to repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word, but the number of repetitions is influenced by the total count of preceding words after the last ""lug"" or for the entire input if no ""lug"" precedes it.

The rule could be formulated as follows:
Rule: When ""walm"" is present, output the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word an extra number of times equal to the count of preceding distinct words since the last ""lug"" was mentioned (excluding ""lug"" itself), or for the entire length of the input if ""lug"" is not present.

Based on this hypothesis, let's apply the rule:
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it, with the number of repetitions depending on the count of preceding distinct words since the last occurrence of ""lug."" If ""lug"" is not present, count from the beginning of the input.",-0.09671985139670586,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns surrounding its use and the corresponding output colors:

1. The word ""walm"" always results in at least one red in the output. In the first three examples, it produces three consecutive reds, and in the fourth example, also three reds. This suggests a rule that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of red.

2. The degree of repetition seems consistent when “walm” appears: there are always three reds in the output following the word ""walm.""

3. The other words seem to correlate with single colors: ""wif"" with red, ""lug"" with blue, ""zup"" with yellow. In the last example, ""bluf"" and ""dax"" seem to correlate with new single colors - ""bluf"" with blue (though there may be confusion as this is the same output as ""lug"") and ""dax"" with green.

The evidence strongly suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to the rule of generating three reds in the output.

Rule: walm -> three consecutive reds in the output.",-1.0138785880284322,27,walm
"Observing the patterns, the nonce word 'walm' seems to be associated with a sequence of the colors red and yellow when followed by other words. However, in the last example, 'walm' is followed by 'dax lug', and the output is a sequence of blue colors, breaking this pattern. This suggests that 'walm' might not correlate with a fixed color output but rather with a sequence of colors that are dependent on the surrounding context, specifically the preceding word.

Let's analyze the instances of 'walm' in the given examples:

1. In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" while ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" This suggests that 'walm' could be replicating the color associated with the word right before it three times.

2. In the second example, ""wif walm"" also leads to ""red red red,"" consistent with the first example.

3. The third example, ""wif walm,"" within the context of additional words, still results in ""red red red,"" which is also consistent with previous examples.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" has a single 'yellow' before ""wif walm,"" followed by ""red red red,"" suggesting that 'walm' may combine the colors of the preceding two unique words (""zup"" being yellow and ""wif"" being red) to define its color sequence, but it prioritizes the color of the directly preceding word.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which could imply that 'walm' replicates the color of the word right before it three times. However, the presence of additional colors following 'walm' indicates a break in the pattern, prompted by 'dax lug' which results in ""green blue."" This suggests 'dax' has an effect of changing the sequence, but it's not clear what the rule is for this change based on the examples given.

Considering the data points, 'walm' appears to replicate the color associated with the word directly before it three times, except when followed by a word that affects the sequence, like 'dax' in the fifth example.

Given these observations, it appears that ""dax"" consistently correlates to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green.",-0.07118317079939426,28,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output an equal number of times.
- ""dax"" does not appear to have any positional influence (beginning, middle, end) on its translation to ""green.""
- No other words in the inputs – ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm"" – translate consistently to ""green"" in the output except for ""dax.""
  
Based on these observations, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green",-1.1346883376589652,28,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green."" Here's how the meaning is extracted from each input/output pair:

- In the first example, ""dax"" directly results in ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears twice and both times it is followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""dax"" again is followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" once more directly results in ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is again followed by ""green"" in the output.

No other word consistently translates to ""green"" besides ""dax,"" and the context of where ""dax"" appears among other words does not change its translation. Therefore, we can form the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",-1.7172844641868974,28,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color green in the output each time it appears in the input. There is a one-to-one relationship between the appearance of the word ""dax"" in the input and the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of the other words in the sentence. This consistency suggests that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"" in the context of these examples.

Rule: dax -> green",-1.7346906055114943,28,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The rule is that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" based on the provided examples, as each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.",-1.7581281549471266,28,dax
"Based on the examples given, it's possible to deduce a pattern and relationship between the nonce word ""wif"" and the outputs generated. Let's analyze the instances one by one:

1. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
2. Input: wif
   Output: red
3. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green
4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
5. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Now, to find the pattern:

- When ""wif"" is presented alone as an input (Example 2), the output is simply ""red"".
- When ""wif"" follows another word (Examples 1, 3, 4), the output associated with ""wif"" is still ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by another word, ""wif"" apparently triggers a duplication of the color associated with the next word, as observed with ""bluf"" and ""walm"" (Examples 1, 3, 4, 5).
- ""wif"" does not change or affect the output sequence of words prior to it (Examples 1, 4, 5).

Therefore, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and also triggers the duplication of the next color word in the sequence.

Phrased as the instruction:
wif -> ""wif"" means red, and causes the next color word to be repeated in the output.",-0.1214779275367533,28,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be related to a specific color output – specifically, the color red. Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. The presence of other words appears to relate to other colors, e.g., ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

Here's the breakdown of the colors based on the examples:

- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> blue (and based on the last example, repeated for each instance of ""walm"")

Rule: zup -> yellow,-1.6569416757898552,28,zup
"To determine the meaning's of ""bluf"", we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Each example has a series of words input that correspond to colors in the output.

We have five examples, let's break down each case to see if there's a direct mapping or a contextual rule for the word ""bluf"":

1. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
   From this, bluf could mean yellow.

2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue
   Here, bluf corresponds to red in one instance and blue in another, suggesting that the color might depend on context.

3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
   Here, bluf corresponds to green. 

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   In this example, bluf corresponds to both blue and blue, matching the color word that appears before it.

5. Input: wif bluf dax lug -> Output: red red green blue
   Here, bluf corresponds to red, matching the color of wif before it.

From these data, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word that directly precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it turns yellow; when it follows ""lug"", it turns blue; and when it follows ""wif"", it turns red.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding color word.",-0.05659455077333674,28,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned prior to it. Each time ""bluf"" is present in the input, the output repeats the color that was assigned to the word right before ""bluf."" To illustrate:

- In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the next word is ""bluf,"" so the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the next word is ""bluf,"" so the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- The same pattern holds for other instances of ""bluf,"" where it takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-1.0985100421617346,28,bluf

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it. Let's look at each example:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, but it is not repeated. The word ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times after.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times after it. ""Wif"" corresponds to red and does not get repeated because ""lug"" comes after ""wif"" again, resulting in another blue.

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times after it. ""Wif"" corresponds to red, which follows at the end.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times after it. 

These rules allow us to deduce the meaning of ""walm"":

Walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.11987993223397259,28,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of the examples provided.

1. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
2. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
3. Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
4. Input: lug walm wif -> Output: blue blue blue red
5. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of ""walm"" in the input seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the first word multiple times. In each case, the output is a repetition of a single color, followed by a different color if ""wif"" is present. ""walm"" does not seem to have a fixed color itself but rather indicates repetition. Here are some observations:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""walm"" follows a single word (""dax"" and ""zup,"" respectively), and the output is the color associated with that word repeated three times.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and there is an additional ""red"" after the sequence of ""yellow,"" indicating that ""wif"" may influence the addition of ""red.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times, followed by ""red,"" again suggesting that ""wif"" adds the ""red.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output has the ""blue"" color four times with ""red"" inserted after the third repetition, followed by another ""blue,"" which maps to the final ""lug.""

Therefore, ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the first word should be repeated until a different word appears or the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> indicates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word (until a different word appears or the sequence ends).",-0.12054268914643836,28,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs of each example:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
3. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   
4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   
5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Observations:
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (Example 1), the output is three times ""green.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" (Example 2 and 5), the output is three times ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""walm"" (Example 2 and 4), the output is ""red"" after the repetition of the initial color.
- When ""lug"" is both before and after ""walm"" (Example 3), the output is three times ""blue,"" followed by ""red,"" ending with ""blue"" again.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" without ""wif"" following (Example 4), there is no final ""blue"" after the repetition of ""blue"" and the ""red.""

Based on these observations, it seems ""walm"" signals a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding ""walm."" When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" a ""red"" is added after the repetitions. If ""walm"" is between two identical words, then the sequence is repeated color, red, repeated color.

2. ""zup wif walm"" outputting ""yellow red red red"" indicates zup corresponds to yellow and wif to red. The presence of walm after wif suggests that walm causes the color associated with the word right before it to be repeated three times.

3. ""lug walm wif lug"" with the output ""blue blue blue red blue"" reinforces the idea since lug seems to correspond to blue, walm caused the repetition of blue thrice, and the presence of wif introduced red into the sequence without repetition, followed by the final lug turning back to blue.

4. ""lug walm wif"" and ""zup walm"" with the outputs ""blue blue blue red"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" respectively support the rule since walm causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times, and wif corresponds to red.",-0.1676876314805479,28,walm
"Through the given examples, we're trying to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" We can deduce the rule based on the output patterns:

1. In the first and fifth examples, ""dax walm"" and ""zup walm,"" the outputs are ""green green green"" and ""yellow yellow yellow,"" respectively. We can see that the color repeats three times, and neither ""dax"" nor ""zup"" is followed by ""wif.""

2. Considering the second example, ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red,"" which is notably different from the fifth example where ""wif"" wasn't present—""zup walm"" led to three times yellow.

3. In the third example, ""lug walm wif lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, ""lug"" appears twice with ""walm"" and ""wif"" in between. This suggests that ""walm"" could be influencing the repetition of ""blue"" and that ""wif"" could be linked to the introduction of ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red."" This is consistent with the third example, implying that ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""walm"" might mean repeat the previous color three times, and ""wif"" introduces the color ""red.""

Taking these observations into account, we can induce the following:

- The presence of ""walm"" after a color word causes the color to repeat three times.
- The presence of ""wif"" introduces a ""red"" after the repetition caused by ""walm.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" could be summarized as:

2. When ""lug"" is combined with other words, it still translates to ""blue"" but the presence of other words seems to determine additional colors.

The following associations can be inferred:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> also seems to translate to blue when ""lug"" is in the same input; potentially ""green"" when with ""wif""
- ""wif"" -> likely red, since it consistently corresponds with ""red"" in the outputs given

Explanation:
Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- ""dax"" correlates with green, ""walm"" also with green, and ""wif"" correlates with red. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and thus is red as well.

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
- ""lug"" correlates with blue, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and should thus be yellow, and ""dax"" restarts the sequence with green.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" correlates with green, and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and thus is also green.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""wif"" correlates with red, and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and thus is also red. ""dax"" restarts the sequence with green.

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue
- ""wif"" correlates with red, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and thus is yellow, but since ""lug"" is blue and comes after ""bluf"", it indicates that ""bluf"" must represent the color previous to ""lug"" in the sequence, which is yellow.

Thus, bluf -> ""the color following the last color word in the sequence green, red, yellow, blue, and before the color word after it (if there is one), otherwise the same as the last color word"".",-0.12489072267811395,29,bluf
"Based on the examples given:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""

Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example:

- ""dax walm wif bluf"" resulted in ""green green green red red"" where ""red"" is repeated after ""wif"".
- ""lug zup bluf dax"" resulted in ""blue yellow yellow green"" where ""yellow"" is repeated after ""zup"".
- ""wif bluf dax"" resulted in ""red red green"" where ""red"" is repeated after ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the output color associated with the word that comes right before ""bluf"".

Rule: If a word X precedes ""bluf"", the output related to ""bluf"" will be the color corresponding to word X.",-0.48420643194189866,29,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that each word corresponds to a specific color's name. For instance:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

In this context, ""bluf"" seems to also correspond to a color. The task is to deduce which color it represents. 

Looking at the examples:

- The first example indicates that ""bluf"" follows three occurrences of the word ""green"" (which are classified as ""green"") and then introduces two ""red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by a ""green"".
- The third example shows ""dax"" after ""bluf"" with the output being two ""greens"", which implies that ""bluf"" is also ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is placed before and after ""bluf"" with all three outputs being ""red"".
- The fifth example positions ""bluf"" between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue), and after ""wif"" (red), resulting in an output sequence of ""red yellow yellow blue"".

Comparing the third and fourth examples, we can deduce that the color for ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that comes after it (when there is a word after ""bluf"").

Therefore, the general rule regarding ""bluf"" seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the subsequent word. If ""bluf"" is the last word or is followed by a word that doesn't have a color value assigned to it, the default color appears to be ""red"".

Rule:
bluf -> Takes the color of the word following it; if there is no subsequent color-associated word, or if it is the last word, the color is red.",-0.7223607640205064,29,bluf
"From the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates into a color that is determined by the word that immediately precedes it. 

Here is how the rule seems to work based on the examples:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output color is green.
2. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output color is red.
3. In the example where ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output color is blue.
4. It is not entirely clear what the output color would be for ""zup bluf"" since there is no direct example, but we can infer that it might be yellow based on the second example where both ""lug zup bluf"" and ""dax"" are translated to colors and ""lug"" and ""dax"" correspond to colors that were established in other examples.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is not a single meaning, but it changes based on the word that comes right before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the preceding word. Here are the associations:

- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" -> green
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" -> red
- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" -> blue

Output: yellow red green green green blue

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: zup walm

It seems that the appearance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a sequence of repeated colors in the output that matches the color representation of the word just before ""walm."" In every example, the word preceding ""walm"" has its color repeated three times upon the appearance of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" we have red repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and following ""walm,"" green is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" leads to three repeated greens again.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated three times.

Analyzing the examples:

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" the presence of ""walm"" leads to three ""red"" in a row.

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug

3. Input: lug walm

1. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""walm,"" which causes the next word ""dax"" to also correspond to red, instead of its usual green.

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - Following ""walm,"" ""lug"" normally corresponds to blue, but it is green because ""dax"" right before ""walm"" is green.

3. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and since it is followed by ""walm,"" the repeated output is blue for each word that follows, although no word follows in this case.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze its use in each provided example and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""dax zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""green yellow green green green."" Since ""zup"" and ""walm"" are both surrounded by ""dax"" yet yield different colors, it is difficult to attribute the color change to these words. Notably, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in every instance.

- In the second example, ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green."" Here, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""bluf,"" but still translates to ""green.""

- In the third example, ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of the preceding words ""zup"" and ""lug.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow."" The word ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and associate with ""green.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""red green yellow red."" ""Dax"" here is used between ""wif"" and ""zup"" and still corresponds to ""green.""

The common factor across all examples is that wherever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" correlates directly with the color green, regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Thus, the rule is that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""",-0.8876940882737501,30,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can figure out the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at the output associated with its placement in different inputs. Here's what we see:

1. When ""dax"" appears, the output always includes ""green"", regardless of its position.
2. The input words ""zup"", ""wif"", and ""bluf"" correspond with ""yellow"", ""red"", and ""green"" respectively. However, note that ""bluf"" is both an input and results in a ""green"" output; the same output as ""dax"".
3. The color ""blue"" is associated with ""lug"" but there are no instances of ""lug"" appearing with ""dax"" to deduce any interactions.

There isn't enough information to determine if ""dax"" has multiple meanings or different rules in different contexts. However, the consistent rule that we can deduce from the given data is:

3. The presence of ""dax"" in the input does not change the output associated with other words. For instance, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of the presence of ""dax"".
4. The word ""dax"" does not affect the output of the words around it. For instance, ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" whether ""dax"" is before or after it.

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the color blue follows the three yellows (""zup walm lug"") or the three blues (""bluf lug walm"").
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", there are only red colors in the output, with no additional color following the three reds.
- When ""walm"" precedes ""dax"", which corresponds to green, this does not change the three repeated colors, but ""dax"" generates a green as expected.

- In the fourth example, it comes at the end of the sequence and leads to three blue outputs.
- In the fifth example, it follows ""red"" and results in double red outputs.

From these observations, we can induce a potential rule for ""walm"": 

The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word in the sequence three times.

Using this rule:

- ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" results in three yellows followed by blue (from ""lug"").
- ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" generates three reds.
- ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" generates three reds; ""dax"" then changes the color to green and ""zup"" to yellow.

- ""Bluf"" is always preceded by at least one other word.

Let's analyze each input and output pair:

1. In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""green green.""
2. In ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" leads to ""red red.""
   - Notice that ""wif"" occurs just before ""bluf"" and ""red red"" is the output.
3. In ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""green green.""
   - Here ""dax"" precedes ""bluf.""
4. In ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" the pattern holds, with ""bluf"" following ""dax"" again to produce ""green green.""
5. In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue blue.""
   - Here ""lug"" comes before ""bluf.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" produces a doubled color that is the same as the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.3459389787112718,31,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is mentioned immediately before it. If there is no color mentioned before it, it defaults to the color ""green"".

- In the first example (""dax bluf""), ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""
- In the second example (""zup dax zup dax wif bluf""), we see the colors yellow-green-yellow-green, with ""wif"" being the last color before ""bluf,"" translating to ""red."" Thus, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" to match ""wif.""
- In the third example (""lug wif lug dax bluf""), the sequence is blue-red-blue-green, with ""dax"" coming before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" to match ""dax.""
- In the fourth example (""wif dax zup wif dax bluf""), the sequence is red-green-yellow-red-green, with ""dax"" before ""bluf"" again, making ""bluf"" translate to ""green"" to match ""dax.""
- In the fifth example (""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug""), ""lug"" comes immediately before the first ""bluf,"" translating to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" maps to ""blue"" in this case. The word ""dax"" that comes after the first ""bluf"" is translated to ""green.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the second color mentioned before it. Here are the observations that lead to this rule:

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"", which is green.

2. In the second example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"", ""bluf"" takes the color mentioned right before it, which is ""wif"" (red), and thus outputs ""red red"".

3. In the third example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"", ""bluf"" again takes the color of the word right before it, ""dax"" (green), so it translates to ""green"".

4. For ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of ""dax"" (green), which comes immediately before it.

5. Finally, in ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and takes on its color (blue), therefore ""bluf"" is blue.

Each instance of the word ""bluf"" in the given examples corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There is no further context provided to indicate that the meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on other words or the position of the word ""bluf"" in the input string. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is that ""bluf"" directly translates to ""green.""",-1.849756706114563,31,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern associating the nonce word ""walm"" with repetition in the output and related to the word preceding it. We see that the word that comes before ""walm"" is repeated in the output and is translated into a specific color. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of words preceding ""walm.""

Based on the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow"" – ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and is repeated twice.
2. ""lug dax walm"" turns into ""blue green green green"" – ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and is repeated thrice, indicating that ""lug"" must map to ""blue.""
3. ""zup wif walm"" turns into ""yellow red red red"" – ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and is repeated thrice.
4. ""dax zup dax walm"" turns into ""green yellow green green green"" – ""dax"" maps to ""green"" again and is repeated four times.
5. ""wif walm dax"" turns into ""red red red green"" – despite ""dax"" coming after ""walm,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and maps to ""red,"" therefore is repeated thrice.

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as follows: 

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat as many times as there are words including ""walm.""

For instance, if there are 2 words before ""walm,"" the color associated with the word right before ""walm"" will repeat twice. This rule captures the pattern seen across all the examples provided.",-0.15710739331269227,31,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the presence of other words and the corresponding output colors:

1. ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
2. ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
3. ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
4. ""wif"" corresponds with ""red""

Now, let's consider the outputs as they relate to the nonce word ""walm"":

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output consists of a repetition of a certain color. The color repeated corresponds to the color associated with the word just before ""walm.""
- The number of repetitions of the color is one more than the number of words before ""walm.""

So, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> A repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, occurring one more time than the number of words that appear before ""walm.""

Rule: If ""x"" is the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" and ""n"" is the number of words before ""walm,"" then the output is ""x"" repeated ""n+1"" times.",-0.7983231737352564,31,walm
"walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" appears to be a rule for repeating the color associated with the previous word in the input sequence. Each time ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.

Rule: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word as many times as there are syllables in that word. For example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" following it results in ""yellow"" repeated once (since ""zup"" has one syllable); ""wif"" results in ""red"" repeated three times (since ""wif"" has one syllable, but perhaps the rule includes the word itself plus a number of repeats); ""dax"" leads to ""green"" repeated three times (since ""dax"" has one syllable). The specific rule for the count of repetition isn't entirely clear from the examples but seems to follow this general pattern.",-0.911275891871795,31,walm
"walm -> rule. Rule: When the word 'walm' is present, the output is a sequence of repeated color words where the number of repetitions and the color itself is dependent on the preceding word or words. Specifically, the last word before 'walm' dictates the color, while the number of repetitions seems to be equal to the number of words before 'walm' plus one. Here is the association of words to colors based on the inputs provided:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

So, ""walm"" triggers a sequence of colors based on the preceding word(s).

Examples:
- ""zup walm"" -> ""zup"" is one word and corresponds to yellow, so the output is yellow repeated once plus one, giving two yellows.
- ""lug dax walm"" -> The last word is ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and with two words before ""walm,"" the output is three greens.
- ""zup wif walm"" -> The last word is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and with two words before ""walm,"" the output is three reds.
- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> The last word is ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and with three words before ""walm,"" the output is four greens.
- ""wif walm dax"" -> Here, ""walm"" does not seem to be in the trigger position, as ""dax"" comes after it, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. However, there seems to be an error in this sequence because according to the established rule, ""wif"" should have resulted in red. It is possible that ""wif walm"" should output two reds as per the rule, and ""dax"" afterwards adds one green. If we ignore the position of ""walm"", we could interpret that ""walm"" locks the color sequence and the word after ""walm"" adds to it following the same rules.",-1.2220533807392475,31,walm

"Rule: The word bluf causes the output color to repeat the preceding color. If there is no preceding color, it defaults to green. 

Explanation:
- In the first example, 'dax bluf wif' becomes 'green green red', meaning 'bluf' takes the color of 'dax', which is green.
- In the second example, 'zup dax bluf' outputs 'yellow green green', where again 'bluf' takes the color of 'dax'—green.
- For 'wif zup bluf', the output is 'red yellow yellow', with 'bluf' repeating the color of 'zup' – yellow.
- In the fourth example, 'lug bluf dax bluf' becomes 'blue blue green green', where 'bluf' first repeats the color of 'lug'—blue, and then repeats the color of 'dax'—green.
- The last example, 'zup bluf wif walm', results in 'yellow yellow red red red', where 'bluf' repeats the yellow from 'zup', and 'walm' doesn't have a direct rule associated but follows the pattern of repeating the previous color if it’s not 'bluf'.

"From the examples provided, we can induce the rule regarding the nonce word ""bluf"" by examining the outputs associated with its position and the words surrounding it. Here is the analysis of the given examples:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""
   When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" and ""red"" follows ""bluf.""

2. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
   When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" again.

3. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""
   Regardless of what precedes ""bluf,"" the output after ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" here.

4. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> ""blue blue green green""
   When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""green,"" consistent with previous cases.

5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
   When ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" and ""walm"" doesn't seem to affect the outcome of preceding words.

By analyzing these examples, it seems like ""bluf"" may act as a mirror to the word that follows it in terms of the output color, except when 'walm' is mentioned where it does not reflect the double nature of 'walm' but rather just gives a single ""red"". So, if ""bluf"" is followed by a word that has a color associated with it, the output color for ""bluf"" matches the following word. Let's write a generalized rule based on these observations:

Rule: ""bluf"" reflects the color of the word that immediately follows it, except when the following word is 'walm,' it results in a single ""red"" rather than reflecting the triple ""red"" associated with 'walm'.

This rule would be applied as follows:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color associated with the word that follows ""bluf"":
- If ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""
- If ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- If ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- If ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" it outputs ""red,"" not ""red red red.""",-0.15704704572346245,32,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" mirrors the color attributed to the word that immediately follows it. To break down the observed pattern:

- In ""dax bluf wif,"" ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" also results in green before ""wif"" turns red.
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" results in green following the green ""dax.""
- In ""wif zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" results in yellow following the yellow ""zup.""
- In ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" is blue following the blue ""lug,"" then ""dax"" is green, and the next ""bluf"" is green following the green ""dax.""
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is yellow following the yellow ""zup,"" ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" continues the red color.

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color attributed to the next word in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> mirrors the color of the following word.",-0.27984151330650003,32,bluf
"Observing the examples provided, I will attempt to deduce the rule applied to the nonce word ""bluf"" in relation to the outputs given.

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the resulting color for ""bluf"" is green.
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the resulting color for ""bluf"" is yellow.
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the resulting color for ""bluf"" is yellow.
4. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the resulting color for ""bluf"" is blue.

From these observations, it appears that the color output for ""bluf"" is determined by the word that comes directly before it. ""Dax"" leads to green, ""zup"" leads to yellow, ""wif"" inconsistently leads to either red or yellow, and ""lug"" leads to blue.

However, there is an inconsistency in the third example where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""bluf"" is yellow, whereas in the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is red. This inconsistency suggests that there may be more nuanced rules, or potentially additional examples are needed to clarify the rule.

Furthermore, the last example shows ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputting ""yellow yellow red red red"", where ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and the output for ""bluf"" is still yellow, deepening the inconsistency noted prior.

One possible rule that takes into account these inconsistencies is that ""bluf"" mirrors the color output of the word directly preceding it, regardless of that word's position in relation to other words:

Rule: The color output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color output for the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" is the first word, then this rule cannot be applied due to insufficient information in the examples provided.

This rule would help reconcile why ""bluf"" is green after ""dax"" (green), yellow after ""zup"" (yellow), and blue after ""lug"" (blue). However, there would need to be an additional rule or clarification for cases where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" as the output color differs between examples. Furthermore, without an example where ""bluf"" is at the beginning, it's not possible to determine what the output would be in that case.

4. Input: dax zup wif          | Output: green yellow red
5. Input: wif bluf dax lug     | Output: red red green blue

Observations:

- The word ""dax"" is consistently followed by the color ""green"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" is consistently followed by the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""lug"" is consistently followed by the color ""blue"" in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" is consistently followed by the color ""red"" in the output.

Now, examining the role of ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red"", suggesting that ""wif"" triggers an additional ""red"" before the expected ""red"" for ""bluf.""
- When ""wif"" appears after ""dax"" and before another word (which is not ""bluf""), the output is ""green red"" with the ""red"" appearing immediately after ""dax,"" a position occupied by ""wif"" in the input.
- In examples 3 and 4, where ""wif"" appears at the end, it is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- When ""wif"" appears at the beginning, as in example 5, it is followed by ""red"" in the output, just before the expected color for the word following it.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each input string that contains ""wif"" results in the output including ""red"" at the position where ""wif"" appears in the input.

Thus, the rule is:

"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""zup"", we will analyze the pattern in the inputs and their respective outputs.

From the given examples:

1. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green

2. Input: zup
   Output: yellow

3. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup bluf dax 
   Output: yellow yellow green

We can observe that every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This is consistent across all examples, irrespective of the positions of other words.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.08748829644144446,33,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Every instance where the word ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
- Other words (""dax"" and ""bluf"") correlate to other specific colors regardless of their position (""dax"" -> green, ""bluf"" -> yellow).
- An unknown word such as ""wif"" or ""walm"" results in ""red"" or additional ""yellow"" outputs, which might suggest an unfamiliar or incorrect word leads to the output ""red,"" but this rule is less clear from the given examples.

Taking these observations into account, the most consistent rule we can deduce is:

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.",-0.773359340462195,33,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color that comes before it. Here's how I deduced it:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which translates to yellow, and so ""bluf"" translates to yellow.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which translates to blue, and therefore ""bluf"" also translates to blue, and again follows ""dax"", and ""bluf"" is translated as green in the output.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to green, so ""bluf"" is green again.
4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" is yellow following ""zup"".
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" translating again to ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs following each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs, noting patterns and consistencies.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- Following ""walm,"" we see ""green green green.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- Following ""walm,"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- ""Walm"" is followed by ""yellow green.""

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""Walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""Walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue.""

Now let's look for a pattern. Every time ""walm"" is mentioned, a color repeats three times in the output. The repeated color is the same as the color of the word preceding ""walm"" in the inputs.

For example, in the first input, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and ""green"" repeats three times after it in the output. In the second input, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and ""yellow"" repeats three times. This pattern holds in all other examples as well.

Rule: 
Walm -> Repeats the color associated with the word just before it three times in the output.",-0.06136224072270833,33,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to result in the word that precedes it being translated into a color and then that color being repeated multiple times. To be more precise, ""walm"" seems to cause the output of the color corresponding to the preceding word, repeating that color three times in the output sequence.

To confirm this rule, let's look at the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""lug dax walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Following ""dax"" we have ""walm,"" and the output then has ""green"" repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" every word is translated to its respective color. Following ""zup"" we have ""walm,"" and the output then consists of ""yellow"" repeated three times.

- The third example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" again demonstrates that after ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" makes that ""yellow"" repeat three times in the output sequence.

- The fourth example, ""wif lug walm,"" shows ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times in the output.

- Finally, the fifth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" confirms that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and following ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times in the output.",-0.4887741784681352,33,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the output of repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here's the breakdown:

1. In ""lug dax walm"", ""lug"" is blue and ""dax"" is green. After ""walm"" is used, we see ""green"" repeated three times.
2. In ""lug wif dax zup walm"", ""zup"" is yellow and after ""walm"" is used, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
3. In ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"", ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times afterward.
4. In ""wif lug walm"", ""lug"" is blue and after ""walm"" is used, ""blue"" is repeated three times.
5. In ""dax lug walm zup wif"", ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times afterward.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used, look at the word directly before it and use the color associated with that word three times in the output sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word right before ""walm"" three times in the output.",-0.5528535131900832,33,walm
"Examining the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to result in the output of that color repeated three more times.

Here are the relevant observations supporting this:

- In the first example, ""lug dax walm"" leads to ""blue green green green,"" with ""walm"" causing ""green"" (which follows ""dax"") to be repeated three more times.
- In the second example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" leads to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" (which follows ""zup"") to repeat three more times.
- The following examples continue to support the rule that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word's output to be tripled.

Using this information, we can define the rule for ""walm"":

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how it transforms into output across the provided examples. Observing the Output corresponding to the word ""walm,"" we see that it translates to repeating the color word that comes before it three more times. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to green. The output is ""green green green.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to yellow. The output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to yellow as well. The output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to blue. The output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to blue again. The output is ""blue blue blue.""

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three additional times in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". We are not sure which word corresponds to which color, but we can look for patterns.

2. In the second example, ""dax bluf"" is translated to ""green green"". This indicates that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color green, or one of them is green and the other is contextually determined.

3. The third example, ""wif dax bluf"", is ""red green green"". This reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" likely represents green, as it does not change its output across examples. ""Wif"" resulted in a red output when it was at the start, so it's reasonable to think that ""wif"" maps to red. Thus, ""dax"" should represent green, as it does in the second example.

4. The fourth example, ""dax lug wif"", gives ""green blue red"". This supports our previous findings: ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is a new word which corresponds to blue in this sequence, and ""wif"" is red again.

5. Finally, the fifth example, ""lug dax lug"", translates to ""blue green blue"". Here, ""lug"" gives a blue output just like in the previous example, and ""dax"" provides a green output, consistent with the earlier hypothesis.

Combining these observations, we induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.13587431421419116,34,dax
"By examining the patterns where the word ""dax"" appears and the corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following:

- When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the output is green (Examples 1 and 3).
- However, when ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is green before ""dax"" and red after it (Example 4).
- When ""dax"" is sandwiched between two occurrences of ""lug,"" the outputs are blue, green, and then blue again (Example 5).
- When ""dax"" stands alone with ""bluf,"" both result in green (Example 2).

It seems that ""dax"" changes the output color to green when it follows another word. However, when it precedes a word, the next color depends on the word following ""dax"" (for example, it will be red if the following word is ""wif""). 

Based on this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color green when it directly follows another word. The color following ""dax"" depends on the subsequent word rather than ""dax"" itself, unless ""dax"" is the last word, in which case ""dax"" also translates to green.

To ensure accuracy, we would need more examples where ""dax"" follows different words and examples where different words follow ""dax"" to better understand how it affects the following color. However, with the current examples, we can conclude:

5. Input: ""lug bluf"" => Output: ""blue blue""

Analyzing the color patterns and where ""bluf"" appears, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

1. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
2. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
3. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""

"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. In each example, the word ""bluf"" appears exactly once.
2. The output color immediately following ""bluf"" is different depending on the word that follows ""bluf.""
3. The word immediately following ""bluf"" determines the color in the output, based on the following associations:
   - If ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" the color is red.
   - If ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color is green.
   - If ""bluf"" is followed by ""walm,"" the color is red.
   - If ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the color is blue.
   - If ""bluf"" is not followed by any word, the color is blue.
4. Additionally, the color that represents ""bluf"" itself is the same as the color that represents the word that follows it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" makes itself and the following word the same color, and that color is determined by the word that comes after ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is at the end, it defaults to being blue, as seen in the last example.

Hence, the answer could be:

bluf -> The word ""bluf"" assumes the color of the following word in the sequence. If there is no following word, ""bluf"" is blue.",-1.1095201354739563,35,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color that is equivalent to the word that immediately follows it. Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" wherein ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" right after ""bluf.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf wif"" is again translated to ""yellow red,"" supporting the initial observation.
3. In the third example, ""bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" consistent with the previous examples.
4. Similarly, in the fourth example, ""bluf lug"" translates to ""green blue,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
5. In the last example, ""bluf"" on its own translates to ""blue blue,"" confirming that when ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is represented twice.

Considering these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes the color meaning of the word immediately following it. If ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" If ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""blue."" It reflects the color associated with the subsequent word.",-1.231497840758242,35,bluf

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents a rule that dictates a pattern occurring immediately before it. If we analyze the examples provided, we can establish the color that appears after ""walm"" is repeated for a certain number of times based on its prior appearance:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax wif bluf,"" which translates to ""yellow yellow green red red"". ""Dax"" preceded ""walm"" and represents the color yellow. ""Yellow"" then appears twice immediately after ""walm"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug zup wif dax,"" which translates to ""yellow blue yellow red green"". Once again, ""dax"" preceded ""walm"" and represents the color yellow, and ""yellow"" appears twice after ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup lug,"" which translates to ""blue blue yellow blue"". Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and represents the color blue, and ""blue"" appears three times after ""walm"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by nothing, so we cannot determine the pattern from this alone. However, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and represents the color blue, and ""blue"" repeats thrice as it had in the previous example after ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by nothing, but we know that ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and represents the color green, and ""green"" repeats thrice after ""walm"".

1. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red""
    - When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
    - When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

4. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
    - When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

5. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
    - This provides further evidence that ""bluf"" results in a color that is the same as the output color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color associated with the word that comes before it, as follows:

Rule:
- ""bluf"" -> meaning. Meaning is the color matched with the preceding word. If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is blue. If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is red. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is yellow. If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is green.",-0.12309099425097224,37,bluf
"Rule: bluf translates to the color that precedes it. If there is no color mentioned before bluf, it repeats the last mentioned color, or if it is the first word, it repeats the color corresponding to the word that follows it.

The reasoning:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is red, which is blue's complementary color. However, in subsequent uses, ""bluf"" follows the pattern where the color word before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output (lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red).

- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" here repeats the color of the preceding noun, which is yellow.

- In the third and fourth examples, ""lug bluf"" and ""dax bluf"" both repeat the color of the word they follow. ""Lug"" is blue and ""dax"" is green, thus ""bluf"" takes on the color of the previous word in each case.

- The last example adheres to the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it (zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue).

Therefore, bluf -> meaning seems to be a repetition of the preceding color word, if there is one, or a repetition of the last mentioned color. If ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence and paired with a color word, it takes on that color for its meaning.",-0.15405990332194447,37,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

1. In the first example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". ""Walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""dax,"" and this sequence is outputted as ""blue blue blue.""

2. In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, and the last two colors are ""blue blue.""

3. In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Here ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" colors in succession.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""red green yellow yellow yellow"". ""Walm"" is at the end of the sequence, following ""zup,"" which has so far been associated with ""yellow.""

5. The fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" outputs ""green green green red red red yellow."" ""Walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" which results in ""green green green."" Additionally, ""walm"" is before ""zup,"" which then outputs ""red.""

It seems like ""walm"" doesn't have a fixed color associated with it; instead, its output depends on the context — the word that comes after ""walm."" Let's examine ""walm"" based on the following color pairs:

- After ""walm"" comes ""dax,"" the color is green.
- After ""walm"" comes ""lug,"" the color is blue.
- After ""walm"" comes ""wif,"" the color is red.
- When no word follows ""walm,"" as in examples 2 and 4, the pattern seems to follow the color of the word before ""walm."" Example 4 is a bit tricky because ""wif"" precedes it but is not directly before ""walm,"" though ""zup"" is and gets the color ""yellow.""

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the color that follows next in the sequence, or if no word follows, it assumes the last mentioned color. If we treat ""walm"" as a word that changes the color based on the next word or, in its absence, duplicates the color of the previous word, the rule appears consistent across all examples.

Rule: Walm -> takes the color of the following word in the sequence, or if no word follows, repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.07692567779702941,37,walm
"From the given examples:

1. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
2. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
3. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
4. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
5. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow

It appears that the word ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat the color that was associated with the previous word. We can see that right after ""walm"" the color that was just mentioned is repeated. For example:

- In the first row, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" caused the repetition of ""blue.""
- Similarly, in the second row, after ""lug walm,"" we get ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow blue red,"" where ""lug"" got ""yellow"" repeated due to ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, the presence of ""walm"" at the end causes ""yellow"" to repeat as it was the color associated with ""zup.""
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""walm wif walm"" is followed by ""green red red,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and then again repeats the color ""red,"" which is associated with ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the next word to take on the color that was assigned to the previously mentioned word. Hence, the meaning is:

Rule: walm -> causes the next word to repeat the color of the previous word.",-0.08276025996453922,37,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can observe that the word ""walm"" precedes a series of identical colors. Specifically, the color following ""walm"" is repeated for a number of words equal to the number of syllables in those words. For example:

- In the first example, ""walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" and ""dax wif lug wif"" has the syllable count 1-1-1-1, which means four ""blue"" outputs after ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by one word, ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and since ""lug"" has one syllable, ""blue"" is repeated once following ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""walm lug wif"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" and the syllable count for ""lug wif"" is 1-1, resulting in two ""yellow"" outputs after ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by one word ""wif zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice after ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow,"" where ""walm wif"" and ""walm zup"" each results in a repetition of ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively, for the number of syllables in ""wif"" (1) and ""zup"" (1).

This analysis suggests that ""walm"" may be a control word that causes the following color to be repeated for as many times as there are syllables in the subsequent words until the next occurrence of ""walm"" or the end of the sequence.

2. No matter what the position 'walm' is in the input, the color ""blue"" follows it.

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". This conclusion is drawn because ""zup"" appears in various positions within the input phrases, and independently of its position, the word ""yellow"" consistently appears in the output.

Here is the analysis:

- When ""zup"" appears by itself with another word (e.g., ""wif"" or ""lug""), ""yellow"" is adjacent to the color that corresponds to the other word (""red"" for ""wif"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"").
- When ""zup"" is part of a sequence (e.g., ""lug zup wif""), the color ""yellow"" is inserted in the corresponding position within the output sequence (in this case, between ""blue"" and ""red"").
- When the input involves repetition (e.g., ""dax zup walm wif walm""), the repeated words correspond to repeated colors in the output (""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""), with ""zup"" still corresponding to a single ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" and another word with a known color are repeated (e.g., ""dax lug zup dax""), the output shows that colors for the non-""zup"" words are maintained (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug""), with ""zup"" yielding ""yellow"" in its respective position.

   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

By examining the outputs corresponding to the inputs, let's consider what ""walm"" could signify:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and the output is an additional ""green"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" is added, and ""walm"" results in another ""green"" being added to the sequence.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is associated with two ""yellow"" colors in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"" colors in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"", resulting in two ""blue"" colors in the output.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the output sequence. Now let's verify this with the provided examples:

- In the first and second examples, ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" of ""dax"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup lug,"" translating to ""yellow blue,"" and it repeats the ""yellow"" that precedes it.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" so it repeats ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" so it repeats ""blue"".

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated in the output.",-0.0696828467529663,38,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to induce the rule behind the nonce word ""walm"". Here are the steps to break down the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   - ""dax"" correlates to a single ""green"".
   - ""walm"" correlates to two more ""green"", hinting that ""walm"" might duplicate the color of the word before it or add two of the previous color.

2. ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green""
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"".
   - Given ""dax"" correlates to ""green"", and ""walm"" follows to give two more ""green"", it supports the hypothesis from example 1.

3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", and we get two additional ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - Again, after ""walm"" we see a repetition of the color before it.

4. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
   - Following the same pattern, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and we see two more ""yellow"".

5. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
   - ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated two more times.

Combining all these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" duplicates the color word before it twice. If ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green"" repeated twice more; if ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color ""yellow"" is outputted twice more, and so on.

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color designation of the word before it twice.",-0.08997316800865171,38,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for a pattern in each line of examples. We want to see how each example's input corresponds to a particular color output. Each word seems to map consistently to a color except for ""walm,"" which we need to figure out.

Considering each input and its corresponding output, let's list the translations we understand:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in the one example it appears

Now let's analyze each example sentence containing ""walm"":

1. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   
   Here ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green."" Since there are three ""green"" in the output, and ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" might correspond to a repetition of the color that comes before it. Therefore, ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated twice, making the output ""green green green.""

2. Input: ""zup dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow green green green""
   
   In this case, the color ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" and ""green"" to ""dax."" Since ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we see two more ""green"" in the output, this again supports that ""walm"" might mean a repetition of the preceding color.

3. Input: ""zup walm lug wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
   
   The ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" we see two more ""yellow,"" which is consistent with our theory. ""Lug"" then corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" to ""red.""

4. Input: ""dax zup walm wif""
   Output: ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
   
   The pattern holds as ""zup"" before ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow"" in the output.

5. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup""
   Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
   
   Here ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and we get two more ""blue"" in the output, supporting the repetition rule.

Hence, the rule we can deduce for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it to be repeated two more times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated two additional times.",-0.0948331065311124,38,walm
"Analyzing the patterns in the given examples:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
3. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
5. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow

The presence of ""walm"" in the input results in multiple colors in the output, and every given example includes ""walm"". Let's examine what follows and precedes ""walm"" to determine the pattern.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output sequence is ""green green."" This pattern is consistent in examples 1, 2, and 4.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output sequence is ""yellow yellow."" This pattern is visible in examples 2, 3, and 5.
3. When ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" (only example 3).
4. When ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" (in examples 3 and 4).
5. In example 5, we see that ""zup"" follows ""lug walm,"" and the sequence ""blue blue"" is repeated before a final ""yellow"" is added due to the last ""zup.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" is acting as a duplicator for the color that follows it and has a special interaction with the word that precedes it, which adds an additional color based on the preceding word.

Here are the proposed rules:

- walm duplicates the next color that follows it.
- The color that precedes walm adds another corresponding color after the duplicated colors.
  
Considering this, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

- walm -> meaning: Walm duplicates the color word that follows it and is also affected by the preceding color word, adding an additional corresponding color based on that word. 

Rule: When ""walm"" is used, take the color word before it, translate it to a color output, take the color word after it, duplicate the translated output for that color, and place it after. If ""walm"" is the last word or is not followed by a color word, the effect of the preceding color word is still accounted for.",-0.1269157074821348,38,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first look for any patterns relating to the other words and colors mentioned in the outputs.

1. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
2. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
3. ""lug"" is seen twice, in the third and fifth examples, and translates to ""blue"" both times.
4. ""wif"" is seen twice, in the third and fourth examples, and translates to ""red.""

Now, let's look at the word ""walm"" in each context:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green green,"" which suggests ""walm"" could mean an additional ""green"" here.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup,"" resulting in ""green green green green."" The pattern suggests that ""walm"" generates an extra ""green"" again.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug wif bluf,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" According to previous deductions, ""bluf"" might correspond to ""red"" since it's not covered by other words and is the only one left.
4. ""walm"" appears after ""zup dax"" in the fourth example, inducing ""yellow yellow yellow red"" in the output. Since we already know ""zup"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively, it seems that ""walm"" here is contributing with an extra ""yellow"" instead of the ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is succeeded by ""zup;"" the output colors around ""walm"" are ""blue blue blue yellow,"" which suggests ""walm"" generates additional ""blue.""

With the given information, ""walm"" seems to contribute with an additional color that matches the color of the word preceding it:

- When preceded by ""dax"" (green), it adds an extra ""green.""
- When preceded by ""zup"" (yellow), it adds an extra ""yellow.""
- When preceded by ""lug"" (blue), it adds an extra ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pattern of outputs in relation to the input containing ""bluf.""

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

3. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue

4. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

5. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

Looking at these examples, the word before ""bluf"" determines the color that precedes the color associated with ""bluf"":

- ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""red"" precedes the color designated by ""bluf"" which is also red.
- ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""yellow"" precedes the color designated by ""bluf"" which has not been specified yet.
- ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""green"" precedes the color designated by ""bluf"" which has not been specified yet.

However, the following patterns can be detected:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds with red.
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds with green.
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds with yellow.

Given that when ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" are followed by ""bluf,"" the color produced by them is repeating itself, suggesting that ""bluf"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" can be constructed as follows:

bluf -> Meaning: ""Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding 'bluf'.""

Rule: If a word X represents a color, X followed by ""bluf"" represents that color twice.",-0.10540795930264865,39,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. In each instance, “bluf” is paired with a color in the output. By examining the outputs associated with the use of ""bluf"" in different inputs, we can deduce a rule or pattern for the meaning of ""bluf."" Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""
    ""wif"" might correspond to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""green.""

2. Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red""
    Consistent with the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: ""zup bluf lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow blue""
    ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

4. Input: ""wif bluf dax"" -> Output: ""red red green""
    Again, consistent with previous examples, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

5. Input: ""dax bluf zup"" -> Output: ""green green yellow""
    Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

From these examples, it is clear that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence. If the word before ""bluf"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output, then ""bluf"" also results in ""red."" If the preceding word results in ""yellow"" in the output, ""bluf"" does as well. Hence, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" copies the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the same color as the preceding word in the sequence.",-0.10598125008532432,39,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the examples given, we need to look for patterns in the input and corresponding output to see how ""bluf"" changes the output. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
2. Input: wif bluf          -> Output: red red
3. Input: zup bluf lug      -> Output: yellow yellow blue
4. Input: wif bluf dax      -> Output: red red green
5. Input: dax bluf zup      -> Output: green green yellow

From the given examples, it appears that the presence of ""bluf"" in the input correlates to a repeating color in the output. The color that repeats is not random; it matches the first color of the output. Let's verify this rule with the examples:

1. 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and when 'bluf' follows, 'red' is repeated once before changing to 'green' for the rest of the sequence.
2. 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and with 'bluf' following, 'red' is again repeated.
3. 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and when followed by 'bluf', 'yellow' is doubled before changing to 'blue'.
4. 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'dax' corresponds to 'green'. With 'bluf' between them, 'red' is repeated once.
5. 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'zup' to 'yellow'. 'Bluf' between them results in a 'green green' before changing to 'yellow'.

Based on these observations, the following rule can be established for the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, it causes the color associated with that word to be repeated once in the output before proceeding to the next color. If ""bluf"" is the second word in the input, the color assigned to the first word is repeated once.

Hence, the rule can be summarized:

bluf -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.11665079109894588,39,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the color patterns produced by the inputs containing the word ""bluf"" and compare them to those that do not contain ""bluf.""

Given examples:
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""
- ""zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow yellow blue""
- ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green""
- ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the color output to repeat the color of the word preceding it. Whenever ""bluf"" follows a word, the color corresponding to that word is duplicated.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:
bluf -> causes the next color in the sequence to repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.13439619379013512,39,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif,"" and to ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax."" When ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

To condense this pattern into a general rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word that precedes it:
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

Thus, bluf -> varies; it is dependent on the preceding word.",-1.018162960999459,39,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the output always consists of colors, and each color is repeated three times. To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern associated with walm in each input and its corresponding output.

- In the first input (""wif walm zup walm""), the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" appears twice, resulting first in three ""yellow"" and then three ""red"" colors in the output. However, this example alone does not provide a clear pattern for ""walm.""
- In the second input (""lug wif dax walm zup""), the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" resulting in three ""green"" followed by a single ""yellow"" in the output, which conflicts with other examples where ""walm"" precedes three of the same color.
- In the third input (""zup walm lug""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is situated between them, resulting in a series of three ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""
- In the fourth input (""wif zup bluf lug walm""), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is not in the output and thus isn't directly translatable to a color, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in three ""blue."" Here, the presence of ""bluf"" did not seem to impact the output.
- In the fifth input (""lug walm zup""), ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" produces an output of three ""blue"" again.

By examining these examples, we can see that the color preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. However, the first example still seems to break this pattern. Let's consider a revised hypothesis: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the input.

Using this hypothesis, let's check the first example again:

- In the first input (""wif walm zup walm""), ""wif"" is ""red,"" then ""walm"" turns into three ""red,"" but when the ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" it turns into three ""yellow"" instead of ""red."" This discrepancy might suggest that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that follows rather than precedes it in cases where ""walm"" appears at the end of the input, or there may be a mistake in the example.

If we align with the most consistent rule from all other examples and attribute the first example as a possible mistake or an exception (which may require more context or information to explain), the rule for ""walm"" would be:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output.",-0.37417169186758253,39,walm
"From the given examples, we can infer that ""walm"" changes the subsequent output's colors to be repeated three times before moving onto the next color or word. 

For instance,

1. In ""wif walm zup walm"", 'wif' becomes 'red', then 'walm' makes 'zup' become 'yellow' three times, followed by another instance of 'walm' making the output yellow another three times.
   
2. In ""lug wif dax walm zup"", 'lug' is 'blue', 'wif' is 'red', and 'dax' is 'green' (repeated twice as per the example), then 'walm' makes 'zup' become 'yellow' three times.

3. In ""zup walm lug"", 'zup' is 'yellow', and then 'walm' makes 'lug' become 'blue' three times.

4. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", 'wif' is 'red', 'zup' is 'yellow', 'bluf lug' is each 'blue', and then 'walm' makes the subsequent colors blue another three times.

5. In ""lug walm zup"", 'lug' is 'blue', and then 'walm' makes 'zup' become 'yellow', repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the subsequent word to repeat three times.",-0.3967697220823076,39,walm
"Analyzing the given examples and the corresponding outputs, I observe the following patterns:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the output colors are ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" This implies that ""walm"" might introduce a sequence of a color that is different from the preceding word's associated color.

2. In the sequence ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green; ""walm"" then transitions to yellow, followed by ""zup"" which maintains the yellow color.

3. When ""zup walm lug"" is the input, ""zup"" outputs yellow, and ""walm"" continues the yellow sequence followed by ""lug,"" which is a break in the sequence, turning the color blue.

4. Similar patterns are observed in the other inputs: after ""walm,"" a single color sequence is established, whether it be a continuation of ""walm"" or a new color introduced by a subsequent word.

Combining these observations, ""walm"" seems to either continue the current color sequence or introduces a new sequence of a different color, likely dependent on what follows ""walm.""

So, based on these examples, the rule I deduce is:

Rule: walm causes continuation of the previous color sequence, and if followed by a word with an associated color different from the current sequence, it begins a new sequence of that color. 

Therefore, the meaning attributed to ""walm"" could be:

walm -> continues the current color sequence or introduces a new color sequence reflecting the next word's associated color if different from the current one.",-0.8034693351634067,39,walm

- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm"" the word ""green"" is repeated twice.
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" the words ""yellow"" is repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" the word ""blue"" is repeated twice.

5. Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red (""dax"" corresponds to ""green""; ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" and possibly multiplies the preceding color; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")

With these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be:

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Looking at the output, whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output:

- Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
- Input: zup lug bluf wif | Output: yellow blue blue red
- Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
- Input: wif dax wif | Output: red green red
- Input: dax walm wif walm | Output: green green green red red red

The word ""wif"" always correlates with the word ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input. Therefore, the induction rule for ""wif"" can be:

"By examining the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word 'wif'.

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
   - 'wif' precedes 'lug' which outputs 'red blue'.
   
2. Input: zup lug bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue red
   - 'wif' appears at the end of the input list and 'red' appears at the end of the output list.

3. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   - 'wif' precedes 'bluf' which outputs 'red red'.

4. Input: wif dax wif -> Output: red green red
   - The sequence starts and ends with 'wif', which gives us 'red' at the start and end in the output.
   
5. Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red
   - 'wif' is followed by 'walm' which outputs 'red'. The number of 'red' outputs corresponds to the occurrence of 'walm' after 'wif'.
   
By analyzing these sequences, we can infer the following rule:

- The word 'wif' translates to the color 'red' in the output. When 'wif' is followed by a word that is repeated afterward, like 'walm' in example 5, it seems to cause the color for that word ('walm' -> 'green') to be repeated for as many times as the word appears after 'wif'.

Thus, the rule for 'wif' can be stated as:

Rule: 'wif' -> translates directly to 'red' in the output sequence. If the next word is repeated afterward in the input, the output for that word is also repeated for each occurrence after 'wif'.",-0.14547532726324328,40,wif

"Based on the input and output examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. Let's analyze the patterns:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red"".
- ""wif"" is consistent in resulting in ""red"" irrespective of where it appears in the input sequence.
- The appearance of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color output of other words; it only produces ""red"" for itself.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

2. bluf -> red (when following wif)
3. bluf -> yellow (when following zup)
4. bluf -> yellow (when following zup)
5. bluf -> blue (when following lug)

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. If we check this hypothesis against the provided examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" thus ""bluf"" output is ""green red"" (notice an extra color is added here, which might represent that ""bluf"" could be a duplicator whenever it appears after ""dax"").
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" thus ""bluf"" output is ""red.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" output is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" thus ""bluf"" output is ""blue.""

However, there's an irregularity with the first example where ""bluf"" generates two colors ""green red."" If we consider ""dax"" as a special case, we might say that whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it duplicates the color corresponding to ""dax"" and then appends ""red.""

- However, in the third, fourth, and fifth examples, ""walm"" does not yield ""green"" in the output. Instead, it appears directly after different words (""zup"", ""lug""), and each time it results in a repetition of the color associated with the word it follows (""yellow"" after ""zup"", ""blue"" after ""lug""). Thus, ""walm"" might indicate a repetition of the previous color's output.

"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the underlying rule for the word ""bluf."" Let's analyze each instance where ""bluf"" occurs and compare the sequence of ""bluf"" with the corresponding output sequence.

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Let's identify patterns before and after the word ""bluf"" in each example:

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the output corresponds to ""red red."" (Examples 1, 3, and 4)
2. When ""bluf"" appears directly after ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" before being followed by another color depending on the next word. (Example 2, ""dax bluf"" is followed by ""green green"", and in Example 5, ""dax bluf"" is followed by ""green yellow."")
3. The presence of ""bluf"" leads to duplication of the color in the output that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" (Examples 1, 3, and 4 show the word before ""bluf"" is reflected twice in the output, while in Example 2, ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of ""green"")

Given these observations, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output.

Thus:

bluf -> meaning: The color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.",-0.06938806171345098,43,bluf
"According to the examples provided, we see a pattern associated with the word ""bluf"" and the colors mentioned in the output. Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red

3. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

Considering these examples:

- Each 'bluf' corresponds to two instances of the color associated with it.
- The color before 'bluf' is not repeated; instead, 'bluf' doubles the color that immediately follows it in the input.

From this, we can induce the following rule for 'bluf':

Rule: When 'bluf' is present in the input sequence, it causes the color that immediately follows it to repeat once in the output sequence. Thus, 'bluf' functions as a duplicator for the subsequent color.

So, the rule for 'bluf' can be written as:

bluf -> Doubles the next mentioned color in the output.",-0.07154325684644115,43,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns for each example and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red

3. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

Analyzing these inputs and outputs together, we can notice the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" we see that ""red red"" appears in the output.
- When ""bluf"" appears in the middle of a sequence, the output reflects the duplication of the color that appears after ""bluf"" in the input sequence.
- When ""bluf"" appears without a word after it, the pattern isn't conclusive based on the provided information, as there are no examples showing what ""bluf"" does at the end of sequences without a word following it.

From the above observations, we can make a rule regarding the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" results in the duplication of the color that is associated with the word following ""bluf"" in the input, except when it is preceded by ""wif,"" in which case it results in ""red red.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to green. The output for ""bluf"" is ""green green,"" meaning it repeats the color of the previous word (""dax"") twice.

3. In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which is red), so the output for ""bluf"" is ""red red,"" repeating the color of ""wif"" twice.

4. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. The output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow,"" again repeating the color of the previous word twice.

1. Input: lug walm

2. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated twice. Then ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" it's followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and then ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
   - It seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word three times.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after a second ""dax,"" we have ""walm,"" followed by three greens.
   - This supports the hypothesis that ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of the color tied to the word right before it.

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - With ""lug"" as blue, followed by ""walm,"" we have the repeating ""blue"" three times, and then with ""dax,"" we have ""green.""

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" influences the color output of the word that immediately follows it. The pattern suggests that when ""walm"" is encountered, the following word generates three outputs in the color associated with that word. In other words, ""walm"" appears to cause a triplication of the color output for the next word.

Here are the instances observed:

1. In ""dax walm zup lug,"" ""zup"" normally outputs yellow, but after ""walm,"" it outputs ""green green green"" instead.
2. In ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" doesn't have a word after it to affect, so it defaults to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" itself may be associated with the color blue when it's at the end of a sequence.
3. In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""wif"" typically outputs red, but here it outputs ""blue blue blue"" after ""walm.""
4. In ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" ""zup"" once again outputs ""red red red,"" showing the triplication effect after ""walm.""
5. For ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""lug"" at the end of this sequence normally results in blue, and after ""walm"" it results in ""green green green.""

Therefore, the rule that ""walm"" seems to be following is: 

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes a word, that word's color output is tripled in the next sequence.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""red blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""

Therefore, we can infer that ""bluf"" in the output depends on the word that precedes it. When alone, it seems to be ""red,"" but this alone is not sufficient to fully determine its meaning. Since ""bluf"" never appears at the beginning of the input, we cannot conclusively determine its standalone output.

However, by looking at other patterns, we can see that ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively, each time they appear. With ""bluf,"" the colour that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it is repeated (except with ""zup,"" which precedes ""bluf"" only once, making it difficult to establish a firm rule).

Therefore, a tentative rule we can deduce is:
- When preceded by another color word, ""bluf"" results in that color being repeated in the output. The exception is with ""zup,"" as there's insufficient data to confirm the pattern. When it appears second, it may result in ""red"" as output, but further examples are required for confirmation.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will compare the input and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax lug walm 
   Output: green blue blue blue 

2. Input: dax lug walm 
   Output: green blue blue blue 

3. Input: dax walm 
   Output: green green green 

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug 
   Output: yellow red green green green blue 

5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif 
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red 

Looking at these examples, we can start to form some rules based on the sequences and their outputs:

- Whenever ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of ""green"" (Example 3).
- When ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" the output is a repetition of ""blue,"" but one less than the number of repetitions in Example 3 (Example 1).
- When ""walm"" is surrounded by different nonce words, it results in a sequence of ""green"" corresponding to its position after ""dax,"" but not affected by the other surrounding words (Example 4).

Based on these observations, the word ""walm"" seems to initiate repetition of the color that correlates with the word preceding it. The number of repetitions in examples 1 and 3 can be determined by the position of ""walm"" right after ""dax"" or ""lug."" However, when ""walm"" appears not immediately after ""dax"" or ""lug,"" but there is a ""dax"" before it, the color ""green"" is repeated, but the count or sequence does not reset to three unless ""walm"" is directly after ""dax"" (Example 4).

Given these rules, my deduction is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" seems to indicate the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, with the number of repetitions linked to its position following that preceding word. When directly after ""dax,"" it repeats ""green"" three times. When directly after ""lug,"" it repeats ""blue"" for as many times minus one as it does ""green"" with ""dax."" When not directly following ""dax"" or ""lug,"" but ""dax"" precedes it in the sequence, ""green"" is the color that's repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" would be:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word, the number of times appears to depend on the specific rule associated with the preceding word (three times when following ""dax"" and one less than three times when following ""lug"").",-0.13741155210857148,45,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples, let's first list each input with its corresponding color output and identify the patterns for words other than ""walm"":

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
5. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red

Examining other words:

- ""dax"" seems to always correspond to the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" seems to always correspond to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" seems to always correspond to the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" seems to always correspond to the color ""red.""

Now, looking at ""walm"":

In examples 1 and 2:
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- However, ""lug"" on its own corresponds to a single ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to be causing an extra ""blue"" color.

In example 3:
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which is ""green""), and the output is all ""green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might be reinforcing or duplicating the color of the word before it.

In example 4:
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which is ""green"") and before ""lug"" (which is ""blue""), the output is ""green green green blue.""

In example 5:
- ""walm"" is between ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red), with the output being ""blue blue blue.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to be repeated an additional time. So, if ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to ""green,"" it will add more ""green"" to the output; if it follows a word that corresponds to ""blue,"" it will add more ""blue,"" and so on.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word before it.",-0.1472210394354762,45,walm
"From the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns before and after it and the corresponding outputs.

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue (This is a repetition, so it doesn't provide new information)
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
5. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red

Analyzing the patterns:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax lug"", and the corresponding output is ""green blue blue blue"". This might suggest that ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it and repeats it.
- The third example, ""dax walm"", matches with this rule as ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"", and repeats it thrice.
- The fourth example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"", further confirms this as ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" and the output related to ""walm"" is ""green green green"".
- Lastly, the fifth example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" also supports this since ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is mapped to ""blue"", and the output related to ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue"".

Thus, based on the provided examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (example 3), the output after ""dax"" is ""green green green,"" which supports the above hypothesis.
- When ""lug"" and ""walm"" occur without any intermediary word (example 5), we observe ""blue blue blue,"" again consistent with the same rule.

Let's test this rule with an example that doesn't follow the immediate predecessor pattern:

- In example 4, ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the output sequence is ""green green green,"" regardless of ""zup wif"" before ""dax.""

In the first example:

In the second example:
- Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif -> Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
  - ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue"" consistently.
  - ""walm"" appears to be linked to ""blue"" as well, although it's not clear why it outputs ""blue"" three times. It could be that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color of the word before it.

In the third example:

  - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and again ""walm"" appears to repeat this color twice.
  - ""dax"" confirms as ""green.""
  - ""zup"" seems to be a new word, translating to ""yellow.""

Rule: wif -> red. ""Wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""",-0.11389963920221328,48,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif.""

1. When ""dax wif"" is input, the output is ""green red."" We see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" We cannot directly deduce what ""wif"" means from this example alone, since we have no comparison.

2. With the input ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" we can see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as previously noted. Given the repeating sequences, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" since it follows both ""dax"" and ""lug"" and leads to ""red"" each time.

3. ""Wif walm"" leading to ""red red red"" suggests that ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red."" This is consistent with the prior examples because ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" and while not directly explainable by this example, does not contradict what we have deduced so far.

4. The input ""wif"" alone producing ""red"" reaffirms that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as it produces ""red"" with no other context.

5. Finally, the input ""wif walm dax zup"" producing ""red red red green yellow"" is consistent with our previous deductions: ""wif"" produces ""red,"" ""walm"" produces ""red"" (though this was originally correlated with ""blue,"" it might simply produce multiple reds), ""dax"" produces ""green,"" and a new element, ""zup,"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule we can derive from these examples is:

Rule: wif -> red

The meaning of ""wif"" seems to be the color ""red,"" as each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.",-0.2244944706674666,48,wif
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is just ""red"".
- When ""wif"" appears after ""dax"", the output is ""green red"".
- When ""wif"" appears after ""lug"", the output is ""blue red"".
- When ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the output sequence always starts with ""red"".

Based on these observations:

- ""wif"" by itself seems to mean ""red"".
- The color that appears before ""red"" seems to be dependent on the word that precedes ""wif"". 

Looking at the examples:

1. ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"", so ""dax"" seems to mean ""green"".
2. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red"", suggesting ""lug"" means ""blue"", and ""walm"" leads to multiple ""blue"" outputs.
3. ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red"", which indicates that ""walm"" after ""wif"" might duplicate the ""red"" meaning of ""wif"".
4. ""wif walm dax zup"" gives us ""red red red green yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" might mean ""yellow"".

So, we can infer that ""wif"" means ""red"", and that its meaning can be influenced by the context in which it is used, particularly by the word that precedes it.

Rule:
wif -> ""red"" (with the color preceding ""red"" possibly being influenced by the word immediately before ""wif"").",-0.24021837438279992,48,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears before ""wif"", the output is ""green red"".
- When ""wif"" is at the beginning of an input or follows the word ""walm"", the output is always ""red"".
- The word ""lug"" by itself results in ""blue"", but that seems irrelevant to the function of ""wif"".
- When ""wif"" is alone in the input, the output is ""red"".
- ""Wif"" preceding ""walm"" results in ""red red red"", and following ""walm"", it continues this pattern with additional ""red"".

From these patterns, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"", but it also seems to have a function of repeating the color output of the word immediately before it (in the case of ""walm wif"" resulting in ""red red red""). 

However, there seems to be an exception when ""dax"" is involved before ""wif"", because the output is ""green red"" instead of ""green green"". This could be evidence of a specific rule that overrides the general pattern when ""dax"" is directly followed by ""wif"".

Given these observations, we can establish:

Rule: ""wif"" results in the color ""red"" and appears to repeat the color output of the word immediately preceding it an undefined number of times when placed after ""walm"". 

wif -> red (with the caveat of the observed behavior when combined with ""walm"" and ""dax"")",-0.9983926375546666,48,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to a single color output: red. Other words seem to correspond to their own respective colors as well, such as ""dax"" to green. The word ""walm"" is repeated three times before another color, possibly reflecting the rule that it repeats the next color output three times.

Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: wif -> red",-1.4934550897560006,48,wif
"Given the examples provided, we can analyze the word ""zup"" by looking at its correspondence in the output in each instance. Let's break it down:

1. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
    - Just before ""zup"" we have ""bluf"" which is ""green"" in the output, and right after ""zup"" we have ""lug"" which is ""blue"" in the output.

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
    - ""Zup"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
    - ""Zup"" follows ""wif"" which again corresponds to ""red"" in the output, and before the next ""wif"" we have ""yellow"".

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
    - ""Zup"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green"" in the output, and follows with ""walm"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug dax zup
   Output: blue green yellow
    - ""Zup"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

From the examples provided, we can deduce that ""zup"" always follows a color word and is translated to ""yellow."" Therefore, it seems that the rule underlying the problem is that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.06135242633724137,48,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following color associations:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow

To determine what ""zup"" means, we should look at the Output associated with each Input that contains ""zup."" Let's analyze the occurrences:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""lug dax bluf,"" the Output is a sequence of three colors, followed by yellow.
2. When ""zup"" is after ""wif,"" the output is red followed by yellow.
3. After ""lug walm wif,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue red,"" ""zup"" results in yellow.
4. When ""wif dax"" precedes ""zup,"" the output is red, green, followed by yellow.
5. After ""lug dax,"" which is ""blue green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow in the output.

Given that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of which words precede it, we can conclude the following rule for ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.6961150642206895,48,zup

Rule: zup -> yellow,-1.9126351008935623,48,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare the inputs containing ""bluf"" to their corresponding outputs and look for patterns that correspond to the word ""bluf.""

Let's start by listing down all the instances of ""bluf"" from the examples given and the corresponding outputs:

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
2. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

Next, let's isolate the sections where ""bluf"" appears:

1. bluf -> red
2. bluf -> green
3. bluf -> green
4. bluf -> red
5. bluf -> red

From these examples with ""bluf,"" we see that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" (in examples 2 and 3) and ""red"" in all other instances.

Given these examples, we cannot say that ""bluf"" corresponds to a particular color without considering its context. Instead, the word ""bluf"" seems to change its meaning based on the words surrounding it, specifically when preceded by ""dax.""

Here's a tentative rule based on the given examples:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it translates to ""green,"" otherwise, it translates to ""red.""",-0.08559700604367416,48,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it appears that each input word is translated consistently to a color in the output. We can see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""zup"" is translated once and corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" is translated once and corresponds to ""blue"". 

Noticing the pattern in each line:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output that follows it is consistently ""red red"", regardless of what precedes it.
- Since ""bluf""'s translation is consistent and not affected by the surrounding words, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to a rule rather than a direct word-to-color translation.

Rule: bluf -> the output directly following ""bluf"" will be ""red"" repeated twice.",-1.0119980060921352,48,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns associated with its use in various examples. Here's what we observe when ""bluf"" appears:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""green.""
3. The third example shows ""dax bluf"" leading to ""green green""; it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it (""dax"" in this case is ""green"").
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""blue"" in this context since it's preceded by ""walm,"" and ""bluf"" takes on the color ""red.""

The consistent pattern seems to be that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word immediately before it, except it appears to always default to ""red"" when followed by another ""bluf,"" no matter the color correspondence earlier in the input.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it; if not directly preceded by a color-associated word or if followed by ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""red.""",-1.251279492287191,48,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""red"". However, this translation does not occur in isolation; it appears context-dependent on the word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", it translates to ""red"". The word prior to ""bluf"" determines its color. 

Let's inspect each example to see if the pattern holds:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" also follows ""wif"", and again ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and both translate to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" once again, with ""bluf"" translating to ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" as well, and once more ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".

However, there's an exception in the third example—when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"", not ""red"". This inconsistency suggests that ""bluf""'s translation might also be influenced by preceding words other than ""wif"", but the given data is insufficient to deduce a pattern for other cases.

Given the limited examples, the safest rule to induce is specifically for when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"". Therefore:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it translates to ""red"". The translation of ""bluf"" in other contexts is not consistent with the available examples.",-1.5044604496719105,48,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""red"". The position of ""bluf"" in the sequence does not seem to affect this outcome, suggesting that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".",-1.7679554328943814,48,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to dictate the color and repetition in the output. Whenever ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is a series of ""red"" repeated once more than the number of words before ""walm"". When ""walm"" appears without ""wif,"" the output is a series of another color, which correlates to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" and the number of repetitions equals the number of times ""walm"" appears.

Analyzing the examples:

- wif walm -> red red red (3 reds)
- zup wif walm -> yellow red red red (1 yellow + 3 reds)
- dax wif walm -> green red red red (1 green + 3 reds)
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (3 yellows, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow)
- dax walm -> green green green (3 greens, and ""dax"" corresponds to green)

The rule:

1. If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" output ""red"" repeated one more time than the total number of words preceding ""walm.""
2. If ""walm"" follows another word, output the color corresponding to that word, repeated as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned.

Rule: walm -> when following ""wif,"" output ""red"" repeated one additional time than the count of preceding words. When following another word, that word dictates the color, and the count of the color in the output matches the count of the word ""walm.""",-0.13087366157914287,48,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of three of whatever color word precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- 'wif walm' -> 'red red red', 'wif' translates to one 'red', followed by 'walm' which repeats the 'red' two more times for a total of three instances of 'red'.
- 'zup wif walm' -> 'yellow red red red', 'zup' translates to 'yellow', then 'wif' translates to one 'red' and 'walm' causes the 'red' to be repeated two more times.
- 'dax wif walm' -> 'green red red red', similarly, 'dax' translates to 'green', 'wif' translates to one 'red' and 'walm' repeats the 'red' color two more times.
- 'zup walm' -> 'yellow yellow yellow', here 'zup' translates to 'yellow', and 'walm' causes 'yellow' to be repeated three times in total.
- 'dax walm' -> 'green green green', here 'dax' translates to 'green' and 'walm' results in a total of three 'green' instances.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word that immediately precedes it to be repeated two additional times, resulting in that color being mentioned three times in total.",-0.14829333768085717,48,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" contributes a repetition of the color mentioned before it. Specifically, it appears to triple the occurrence of the preceding color in the output. In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" results in a single ""red,"" and then adding ""walm"" gives ""red red red."" When another word like ""zup"" or ""dax"" is present that corresponds to a different color, such as ""yellow"" or ""green"", ""walm"" again causes this color to be repeated thrice. When ""wif"" is included with these words, ""walm"" adds three more ""red"" after the color associated with ""zup"" or ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word directly preceding it (whether it's ""wif"" for red, ""zup"" for yellow, or ""dax"" for green) and repeats that color three times in the output.

Let's look at the examples to see this pattern:

- Input: dax bluf — Output: green green (dax corresponds to green, followed by bluf, hence green is repeated)
- Input: lug bluf zup lug — Output: blue blue yellow blue (lug corresponds to blue, followed by bluf, so blue is repeated; note that zup's corresponding yellow is not repeated as it's not followed by bluf)
- Input: wif bluf dax walm — Output: red red green green green (wif corresponds to red, followed by bluf, hence red is repeated; dax's green is not affected by bluf here, walm is a green repetition but not influenced by bluf)
- Input: lug bluf — Output: blue blue (lug corresponds to blue, followed by bluf, so blue is repeated)
- Input: lug wif bluf — Output: blue red red (wif corresponds to red, followed by bluf, hence red is repeated; lug's corresponding blue is not repeated here as it's not immediately followed by bluf)

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""

From the data provided, it looks like the word ""bluf"" is causing the color word before it to be duplicated in the output. Each time ""bluf"" appears, the color word (representing another word before it) in the output is repeated.

Here is the rule induction based on the examples provided:

2. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
3. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. lug wif bluf -> blue red red

Based on these examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it:

- In the first and fourth examples, the word before ""bluf"" is translated to a color, and ""bluf"" causes that color to be repeated.
- The pattern holds for the fifth example as well, where two words precede ""bluf,"" and the corresponding colors of both words are repeated.
- In the second and third examples, the word after ""bluf"" doesn't get duplicated, suggesting that ""bluf"" only affects the word just before it. Furthermore, the last word in the third sequence, ""walm,"" doesn't have a preceding ""bluf"" and thus is translated to a single ""green"" as opposed to the doubled ""green green"" that ""dax"" produces when followed by ""bluf.""

"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. 

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" which means ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue), so it repeats the color blue.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" After ""wif"" (which is red), ""bluf"" repeats the color red.
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" directly translates to ""blue blue,"" with ""bluf"" repeating the color of ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.

So, bluf appears to mean ""repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before bluf.""",-0.15798659056436615,49,bluf

- ""lug bluf zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue yellow blue"" so ""lug"" means blue and ""bluf"" causes ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated.
- Similarly, in ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""wif"" means red, ""dax"" means green, and ""bluf"" repeats the color red associated with ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color word that precedes it.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided examples. Let's examine each input and associated output to decipher the rules:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

5. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

We notice that the color that follows each occurrence of ""walm"" differs, which suggests ""walm"" is dependent on the context or the word that follows it. Let's look at the color that comes after ""walm"" in each case:

1. green -> yellow, blue
2. green -> yellow
3. red -> green
4. green -> red
5. green -> red, green

By examining the relationship between ""walm"" and the following word/color, we can attempt to extract a rule. However, with the given examples, the output color doesn't seem directly linked to the specific word that follows ""walm.""

Let's look at the words preceding ""walm"" instead:

1. dax -> green
2. dax -> green
3. wif -> red
4. dax -> green
5. dax -> green

The word preceding ""walm"" corresponds to a color in the output. Now let's see if ""walm"" has an effect on this:

- After ""dax walm,"" we observe an additional ""green"" before it changes to other colors.
- ""wif walm"" also produces an additional ""red.""

It appears that ""walm"" may function as a repeater for the color implied by the word immediately before ""walm."" Essentially, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word before ""walm.""

Given the examples, let's illustrate the rule:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm -> The first ""walm"" repeats ""green,"" hence ""green green."" The second ""walm"" repeats ""blue,"" hence ""blue blue.""
2. Input: dax walm zup lug -> ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats ""green,"" resulting in ""green green.""
3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> ""walm"" following ""wif"" repeats ""red,"" resulting in ""red red.""
4. Input: dax walm wif -> ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats ""green,"" resulting in ""green green.""
5. Input: dax walm wif dax -> ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats ""green,"" so ""green green,"" and there is no ""walm"" after ""wif"" to influence the output.

Therefore, walm -> Repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm.""",-0.09086657784893544,49,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the outputs in context with the appearance of the word ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. When we see ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" the output has ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" appears twice and appears to result in two different colors; the first time it precedes ""yellow,"" and the second time it precedes ""blue blue blue.""

2. ""Dax walm zup lug"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow.""

3. ""Wif walm dax zup"" becomes ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""green.""

4. ""Dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""red.""

5. ""Dax walm wif dax"" becomes ""green green green red green."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""red,"" then ""green.""

A pattern that could be deduced is:

- ""Dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""Zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""Lug"" seems consistent with ""blue.""
- ""Wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Now, focusing on ""walm,"" it doesn't seem to consistently translate to any single color, but it seems that it may be determining the color that comes next. From the outputs given, it can be noticed that the color after ""walm"" in each sequence is a repeat of the color corresponding to the word that immediately follows ""walm.""

In other words, ""walm"" could signify ""repeat the color corresponding to the next word.""

Applying this rule:

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
- ""Dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""Walm"" then signals the next word's color to be repeated
- ""Zup"" means ""yellow""
- ""Lug"" means ""blue"", and because ""walm"" precedes, it means two more ""blue""

Using this logic on the last example:

Input: dax walm wif dax
- ""Dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""Walm"" means the next word's color should be repeated, which is ""wif,"" meaning ""red""
- The final ""dax"" means ""green"" again.

With this understanding:

Walm -> Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence.",-0.14708243935268814,49,walm
"From the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" is a transformation or a function that changes the sequence's output based on the word that comes after ""walm"". Looking closely:

- ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green""
- ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red""

We can notice that after the word ""walm"", the color sequence starts with the repetition of a color three times, followed by a different color. The number of times the color is repeated might be a key characteristic imparted by ""walm"", considering that three instances of green, red, or blue appear after ""walm"" in each example. The color that follows these repetitions corresponds specifically to the word that comes after ""walm"". 

Therefore, we could deduce that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color associated with the next word thrice before proceeding with the translation of the actual words. However, we see that ""dax"" following a ""walm"" doesn't repeat the color green three times but appears to reset the pattern with a single instance of green.

Given this, the rule could be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated thrice, **except** if the next word is ""dax"", in which case the pattern is reset, and the output is a single instance of green.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice and each time it is followed by three instances of the color green in the output.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by two instances of green.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" precedes green, just as in the previous examples.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by two instances of green.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by two instances of green.

From these observations, a pattern emerges: the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color green appearing twice in the output. Whenever ""walm"" is used in the input, it consistently results in two greens in the output, irrespective of other colors that follow.

Based on this, the rule can be deduced as:
walm -> the word ""walm"" means two instances of green.

1. ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green""
2. ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow""
3. ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green""

In the first line:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

In this line, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow."" So it's possible ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""

In the second line:
Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Just as in the first line, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow."" The rest of the words correspond to other colors.

In the third line:

""Bluf"" in this line is again corresponding to ""green,"" the color that comes right before it. This suggests that ""bluf"" might be a repeater word, taking the same meaning as the word (or color) immediately preceding it.

In the fourth and fifth lines:

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif

In both these lines, ""bluf"" again takes the color that directly precedes it. In the fourth, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and so ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" In the fifth, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" likewise translates to ""green.""

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color indicated by the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the meaning (color) of the word directly before it.",-0.06650839758825981,50,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following associations:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Examining the sequences where ""bluf"" occurs and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to determine the rule for ""bluf"". Let's look at each example:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
3. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
4. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
5. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red

In examples 1 and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by green in the output when ""dax"" precedes it. In examples 2 and 4 ""bluf"" is followed by red in the output when ""wif"" follows it. However, these patterns do not hold consistently, since in example 3, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" and the output is green yellow. Considering this, we might infer that the meaning of ""bluf"" could depend on the context of the surrounding words. 

However, analyzing the sequences, another pattern emerges where ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color that the previous word represents. Let's verify this with the examples:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (previous word zup means yellow)
2. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue (previous word zup means yellow)
3. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red (previous word dax means green)
4. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red (previous word wif means red)
5. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red (previous word dax means green)

In every instance, ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the preceding word. The pattern holds consistent across all the provided examples. Therefore, we can conclude the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the meaning of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.07950809157160586,50,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze the pattern of colors corresponding to the nonce word ""bluf"" and the words around it in each example.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both translate to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") and is followed by ""lug"" (which is ""blue"").
- In the third example, ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red."" In this case, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" (which is ""green"") and followed by ""zup"" (also ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" here).
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" The ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence follows ""wif"" (which is ""red""), and there is no word after it.
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which is ""green"") and is followed by ""wif"" (which is ""red"").

Considering all the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not hold a fixed meaning. Instead, it appears to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it assumes the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",-0.09244213801970588,50,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we will look at the pattern of outputs in relation to their inputs.

From the examples:

1. ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow."" Zup translates to yellow.
2. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" Bluf appears to maintain the color of the previous word zup which is yellow. Lug translates to blue and dax to green.
3. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" results in ""blue green green yellow blue red."" Bluf in this instance repeats the color green from the preceding word dax. Wif translates to red.
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Bluf is red following wif but not immediately after; it involves repetition of a color that occurred earlier in the sequence.
5. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" results in ""yellow blue red green green red."" Bluf follows dax and repeats the color green.

The rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to review the provided examples and find a consistent pattern that can be applied across all inputs.

We have the following input/output pairs:

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Looking at the examples:

- When ""wif"" is in the input, ""red"" is in the output.
- When ""lug"" is in the input, ""blue"" is in the output.
- When ""dax"" is in the input, ""green"" is in the output.
- When ""bluf"" is in the input, ""blue"" is in the output.
- When ""zup"" is in the input, ""yellow"" is in the output.

From the above, we can establish that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output.

Upon reviewing the occurrences of ""walm"" in the input, a pattern emerges in the output:

- ""walm"" consistently causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be three:
  
  - In the first example, ""walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue"".
  - In the second example, ""walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue"".
  - In the third example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue red"".
  - In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".
  - In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".

- In the second example, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"", with ""yellow yellow yellow"" seemingly corresponding to ""zup walm lug"", again indicating a thrice repetition of ""lug""'s color due to ""walm"".
- The third example further supports the rule, with ""lug walm wif"" resulting in ""blue blue blue red red"", showing that ""walm"" again causes the thrice repetition of ""lug""'s associated color.
- The examples with only ""dax walm"" and ""zup walm"" producing triples of ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively solidify that ""walm"" prompts a repeating of the color of the subsequent word three times.

"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" By examining each instance of ""walm"" and its corresponding output, a pattern seems to emerge.

- In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""red"" three times before moving on to the next word's associated color.
- In the second example, ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times, again suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the following word to be repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when preceded by ""walm"" it turns into ""blue"" repeated three times, which supports the pattern we've observed so far.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" again causes the corresponding color of the next word (""dax"" for green and ""zup"" for yellow) to be repeated three times.

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> green green green yellow blue
2. ""dax walm"" -> green green green
3. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> green yellow blue blue
4. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> blue green green green red
5. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> yellow green blue green blue yellow blue

In examples 2 and 4, the word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and each instance of ""walm"" also translates to ""green."" If we assume that one instance of ""green"" is due to the input ""dax"" and the other instances are due to ""walm,"" then we can reaffirm that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Additionally, no other word in the inputs consistently results in ""green"" when ""dax"" is not present, supporting the notion that ""dax"" is directly responsible for the instances of ""green"" in the outputs.

Based on this information, the rule appears to be:

- The color ""green"" appears as many times as the word ""walm"" does.
- The word ""dax"" precedes the sequence of ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" might be associated with the color ""green.""
- However, when ""dax"" is present, there are additional colors in the output beside ""green."" The sequence and number of colors do not always match the position or count of ""dax"" in the input.

Considering these observations:

- In input 1, ""dax walm zup lug,"" ""walm"" is followed by three ""green,"" suggesting ""walm"" could mean ""green.""
- In input 2, ""dax walm,"" the sequence of ""green green green"" indicates that ""dax"" may also mean ""green"" or trigger the color ""green,""

- In input 5, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" we see the pattern where ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

From these examples, it's clear that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sentence. It does not seem dependent on context.

- In the first input ""dax zup walm wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to the last color ""red"".
- In the second input ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", ""wif"" is the first word and corresponds to the first color ""red"".

- ""walm"" maps to ""yellow"" in the first two examples where it appears.

- ""bluf"" maps to ""red"" in the third example, but not in the same way ""wif"" does.

Now let's consider ""wif"":

- It maps to ""red"" when it's at the beginning (examples 1, 2, and 4) or in the middle of a sequence (examples 2 and 3), but also ""red"" when followed by ""dax"" (example 5).

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" I will look at the patterns before and after its occurrence in the given examples and their corresponding outputs. Let's analyze each input with its output:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
4. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   
5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

From these examples, we notice the following:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the color that follows ""bluf"" in the output pattern is influenced by the word just before ""bluf"".
- When ""wif"" is the word before ""bluf,"" the output color is always red, indicated by the outputs that contain ""wif bluf"" -> red red.
- When ""dax"" is the word before ""bluf,"" the output color is green, noticed in the sequence ""dax bluf"" -> green green.
- When ""zup"" is the word before ""bluf,"" the output color is yellow, seen in the sequence ""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow.

Given these observations, we can induce that the ""bluf"" itself may not have its own color but rather duplicates the color assigned to the word that comes immediately before it. Hence, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word before it.",-0.11505034505277496,51,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let us examine the correlation between the input and output in each example. We need to determine the pattern of how the nonce word ""bluf"" is translated into the colors in the output. 

By looking at each example:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
5. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green

It appears that ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". Also, we can see that the position of ""bluf"" in the input doesn't matter; it always results in ""green"" in the output. However, in examples 4 and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by an additional ""green,"" similar to the nonces that precede it.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in the output ""green"" and possibly incites a repetition or continuation of the last color mentioned:

Rule: bluf -> ""green"", with the potential continuation of the preceding color pattern if applicable.",-0.117802566826375,51,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the examples provided:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
5. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green

From these examples, the following observations can be made:

- ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input string in every example.
- ""bluf"" is always followed by an additional color output beyond what the preceding words would predict.

Looking at the repeated sequences:

- ""wif bluf"" consistently outputs ""red red."" ""wif"" appears to correlate with the color red, and ""bluf"" adds an additional red.
- When ""dax"" and ""zup"" are followed by ""bluf,"" an additional green is added beyond the sequence for ""dax zup.""

It appears that ""bluf"" causes the color of the last word before it to repeat. So, if the last word is ""wif"" and ""wif"" correlates to red, then ""bluf"" will add another red. If the last word is ""dax"" or ""zup"" and either correlates to green or yellow, then ""bluf"" will add another green.

As a rule:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the color associated with the last word before it in the sequence.

Rule:
- When ""bluf"" is present at the end of a sequence, take the color corresponding to the last word before ""bluf"" and repeat it. If there's no established pattern for the last word, then the rule does not apply.",-0.13575529626399996,51,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we have to find a pattern or rule within the examples given. Let's analyze the Input with its corresponding Output:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
5. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green

From these examples, we notice that ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow."" 

Noticeably, ""bluf"" appears at the end of each input sequence. Let's look at the corresponding colors at the end of each output sequence where ""bluf"" appears:
- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by two ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup zup.""
- In examples 2 and 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" which relates to ""wif wif.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is from ""dax.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green green,"" which can be correlated to ""dax dax.""

By analyzing the instances where ""bluf"" appears, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it twice. In examples 2 and 3, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the color is ""red red."" In example 5, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the color is ""green green."" In example 4, only one ""green"" follows ""bluf,"" which doesn't fit the pattern perfectly unless we consider that the last color is simply repeating the color of ""bluf.""

Thus, our rule might be:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word and outputs it twice.

However, the example 4 seems to be the exception to this rule, or there may be missing information. With the data provided, this is the closest pattern we could induce. We could also clarify that in the context of the sequences provided, the presence of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" or ""wif"" doesn't change the color output for ""dax"" and ""wif,"" but rather adds an additional color to the sequence based on the preceding word.",-0.13995518809543744,51,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll look at the consistency of the colors associated with other words across the examples.

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output.

Now, let's consider the usage of ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" (Examples 1 and 5).
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is ""red"" (Examples 2 and 3).
3. In the case of ""dax zup wif dax bluf,"" with ""dax"" occurring just before ""bluf,"" the output color is ""green"" (Example 4).

From these observations, we can derive a rule.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. ""Bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes before it.

Therefore, ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word.

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.",-0.7275071851446253,51,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine how the outputs change with respect to the words preceding and succeeding ""walm.""

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and succeeded by another ""dax,""
Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
The only output that does not match the direct color translation (dax -> green, wif -> red) is the middle 'green,' which corresponds to ""walm."" However, the following red seems to be influenced by having ""dax"" after ""wif.""

2. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and succeeded by ""lug,""
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
Here, all instances of ""walm"" are followed by red (representing ""wif""), and the color to represent ""lug"" appears to be blue.

3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and succeeded by ""dax,""
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Again, the color red follows ""wif,"" and the color to represent ""dax"" is green.

4. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and succeeded by nothing,
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Here, blue corresponds to ""lug,"" and ""walm"" maintains the blue coloration.

5. When ""walm"" is involved with multiple words,
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
""Walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" and the pattern seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word before it.",-0.07871551688411828,51,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern before and after the appearance of the word in different sentences and their corresponding outputs. We are looking for a consistent change that occurs when the word ""walm"" is introduced.

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the word that follows ""walm"" changes color compared to its default color.
- In examples 1, 2, and 3 (""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" follow ""walm""), these words change to red in the output, regardless of their normal color (green for ""dax"" and blue for ""lug"").
- In examples 4 and 5, after ""walm,"" the next color sequence has duplicated colors (blue blue, green red blue).
- Therefore, ""walm"" seems to modify the output color of the word that follows it, either by changing it to red (when there is more than one word following it) or by duplicating the next output color sequence (when it is the last word or before the last word in the sequence).

Based on these observations, the rule could be interpreted as:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the output color of the following word to red if there is more than one word following it or duplicates the next color sequence if it is the last or before the last word.

Therefore:

walm -> changes the output color of the following word or duplicates the next color sequence depending on the position.",-0.0897327322967742,51,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

- When ""dax walm wif dax"" occurs, the output is ""green green green red green"". This indicates that ""walm"" does not directly translate to ""green"" because there's a ""red"" in the output sequence.
  
- In ""wif walm lug bluf,"" the output is ""red red red blue blue."" Given that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" twice, it seems that ""wif"" might correlate with ""red."" It's unclear if ""walm"" translates to ""red"" or if it has another function that leads to the repeated ""red"" in the output when juxtaposed with ""wif.""

- With the input ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" Once more, ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Zup"" is a new element translating to ""yellow."" ""Walm,"" however, does not translate to ""red"" here, as ""red"" precedes it and is associated with ""wif.""

- When considering ""dax lug walm,"" with the output being ""green blue blue blue,"" and ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" resulting in ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" it's shown that ""walm"" does not have a consistent color association. After ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated, suggesting that ""walm"" might indicate repetition of the previous color, but this does not hold true when ""dax"" or ""wif"" follows ""walm.""

From these observations, a possible rule emerges: ""walm"" may signify ""repeat the following color for the output."" This would explain why it often appears with a color repetition, except in the case where ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence where there is no color to repeat.

Let's test this hypothesis:

1. In ""dax walm wif dax,"" repeating ""green"" before ""wif"" became ""red"" fits.
2. For ""wif walm lug bluf,"" repeating ""red"" before ""lug"" turns to ""blue,"" this works.
3. Considering ""wif walm dax zup,"" repeating ""red"" before ""dax"" turns to ""green"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" this aligns well.
4. In ""dax lug walm,"" we expected a repeat of the color after ""walm"" but since it's the end of the string, there's no color to repeat; thus, the rule doesn't directly apply.
5. Finally, for ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" the repetition happens before ""dax"" which is ""green,"" before ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and the pattern fits.

However, there's inconsistency with the last example if ""walm"" merely repeats the following color since there is a discrepancy in the number of colors before and after ""walm."" Therefore, another interpretation might be that ""walm"" causes the previous color to repeat unless it's at the end of the sequence, or unless another word breaks the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the last color mentioned before it, except when it appears at the end of the sequence with no subsequent color, or another non-color word interrupts the sequence.",-0.09960742511645161,51,walm
"To deduce what the nonce word ""walm"" means, let’s analyze the patterns before and after it appears:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif dax"" and the output sequence is ""green green green red green."" Since ""walm"" is not at the end of the sequence, it is not directly corresponding to ""red"" or ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug bluf"" and the output sequence is ""red red red blue blue."" Again, ""walm"" is not at the end and does not directly map to ""blue.""

3. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax zup"" and the output sequence is ""red red red green yellow."" ""Walm"" is not at the end and does not correspond to ""green"" or ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" results in an output of ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output sequence starts with ""green"" for ""dax,"" followed by three ""blue"" colors.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" yields a sequence of ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" where ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

From these examples, we notice that whenever ""walm"" appears, it is followed by three instances of the same color in the output sequence, regardless of the color that corresponds to the word that comes right after ""walm."" This suggests that ""walm"" indicates repeating the input word's respective color three times in the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the next word in the input sequence three times.

Rule: walm -> A repeating sequence of three of the color corresponding to the following word.",-0.43898883805720423,51,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word that follows it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax walm wif dax,"" the word following ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red. Since there's ""walm wif,"" the output next to ""walm"" is red, and it's only once because ""wif"" appears only once after ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and follows ""walm."" There are two occurrences of ""lug"" following ""walm"" which results in two instances of blue in the output.
- Similarly, in the third example, the output matches the number of times the following color appears.
- The fourth example, ""dax lug walm,"" ends with ""walm"" followed by no word, so ""walm"" is repeated as the color of the last word which is blue corresponding to ""lug.""
- In the last example, there are two instances of ""dax"" (green) and two of ""wif"" (red) following ""walm,"" which results in ""blue blue blue green red"" in the output.",-0.8923813469061287,51,walm

3) wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

5) lug walm wif -> blue blue blue red

Analyzing the given examples, let's establish the associations we can see for words other than ""wif"":

- ""zup"" is consistently associated with ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"", but in example 3, it follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug"" and is still ""red"", so there's no direct influence from ""wif"" here.
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
- For ""walm,"" there is only one instance, and it is associated with ""blue"".

Now, let's inspect the instances in which ""wif"" is used:

- In example 1, ""wif"" appears twice and is associated with ""red"" both times, regardless of the position.
- In example 2, ""wif"" is the first and third word in the sequence and both are associated with ""red"".
- In example 3, ""wif"" is the first word and is associated with ""red"".
- In example 4, ""wif"" is the final word and is associated with ""red"".
- In example 5, ""wif"" is the last word again and is associated with ""red"".

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""wif"". It seems that each word is translated into a color, and the examples provide a consistent mapping between certain words and colors, except for the word ""wif"". Let's examine the data:

1. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
2. ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"".
3. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
4. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".

The word ""wif"" appears in various positions in the sentence and corresponds to different colors in the output. From the provided data, we can attempt to induce its meaning:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and translates to ""red"", but when followed by ""zup"", it is ""green"". 
- In the second example, the first ""wif"" is not followed by any specific word and translates to ""red"", and the second ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and translates to ""red"" again.
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears first and last in the input sequence, translating to ""red"" and ""yellow"", respectively.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is last and translates to ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is last and translates to ""red"".

Considering the examples, the main consistent rule that can be inferred is that ""wif"", when it appears as the last word, translates to ""red"", except in the first example where it results in ""green"" at the end of the first list of words.

From this example, we can see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" follows both ""wif"" and ""zup"" and subsequent colors change in the output, it's reasonable to assume ""walm"" has an effect on the following words' output colors.

We also see that after the second ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times instead of once. This may indicate that ""walm"" influences the number of times the following color is repeated.

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

In this example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and there are three ""red"" outputs. Since there is no word following ""walm,"" we cannot infer the effect of ""walm"" on the subsequent word here.

3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The ""walm"" after ""lug"" does not seem to affect the ""wif"" that follows, since the output is not altered in quantity or color. However, after the second ""wif,"" we see ""yellow red,"" which suggests that ""red"" was supposed to be repeated but was not due to the presence of ""zup"" before the final ""wif.""

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to an additional ""red"" being produced before changing to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

""Zup"" normally corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" but after ""walm,"" it is repeated three times. This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" influences the number of times the following color is repeated. 

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence to be repeated three times. If there is no word after ""walm,"" it appears to have no discernible effect.

Therefore: walm -> causes the next color to be repeated three times.",-0.10379590704152875,52,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

- Example 1: ""wif walm zup walm"" generates the output ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" 
Given that ""wif"" is consistently represented by the color red in the outputs and ""zup"" by yellow, the first ""walm"" after ""wif"" shifts the color to yellow (from red), and the second ""walm"" keeps the color on yellow.

- Example 2: ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Here, there are three reds, which correspond to the ""wif,"" but it's not clear what ""walm"" contributes.

- Example 3: ""lug walm wif zup wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" ""lug"" is associated with blue, and we can see that ""walm"" after ""lug"" doesn't appear to change the output as it remains blue. However, after ""walm,"" we see the color red associated with ""wif."" It's interesting to note that the ""zup"" here gives us a yellow, then it switches back to red with another ""wif.""

- Example 4: ""zup wif walm lug"" produces ""yellow red red red blue."" In this example, the ""walm"" appears to have no impact on the output, as the pattern of colors before and after ""walm"" remains consistent with the corresponding words (""wif"" and ""lug"").

- Example 5: ""zup walm wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" is linked to yellow, but the appearance of ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word, as it remains yellow after ""walm,"" then switches to red with ""wif.""

Based on the above examples, we can surmise that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word directly preceding it. This suggests that ""walm"" likely indicates repetition or duplication in the context of the coloring pattern.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat.",-0.10630324877886206,52,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's look at the outputs corresponding to each input where ""walm"" is present:

1. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
   In this example, ""walm"" is correlated with two instances of the output ""yellow yellow yellow"".

2. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
   Here, the inclusion of ""walm"" does not result in any ""yellow"" outputs, suggesting that ""walm"" may not necessarily be directly translating to an output color by itself.

3. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
   ""walm"" appears once, and subsequently, one instance of ""yellow"" appears in the output.

4. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
   The word ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and corresponds to an instance of ""red"" in the output.

5. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   ""walm"" appears once, followed by ""wif,"" and it corresponds to two extra instances of ""yellow"" before ""red"" appears.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following:
- ""walm"" appears to have an effect on the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The presence of ""walm"" seems to increase the occurrence of the color ""yellow"" except when it follows ""wif.""
- The effect of ""walm"" is dependent on the context of the sentence and the words around it. In particular, the word that follows ""walm"" seems to be important, as the color produced in the output may change based on the next word.
- ""walm"" does not consistently lead to a single fixed output color; instead, its presence modifies the output pattern of colors, especially concerning the word ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" generates additional occurrences of ""yellow"" in the output except when preceded by ""wif."" When it is preceded by ""wif,"" it does not generate ""yellow.""

Rule:

walm -> When following a word, ""walm"" usually results in multiple ""yellow"" in the output, except when it directly follows ""wif,"" in which case the expected ""yellows"" do not appear.",-0.10691850540826435,52,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will look for patterns in the provided examples.

First, I will list each input beside its corresponding output to see if there is a discernible pattern:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm | Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif | Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
4. Input: zup wif walm lug | Output: yellow red red red blue
5. Input: zup walm wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Upon examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, I notice:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the next three corresponding outputs are ""red.""
- When ""walm"" is directly after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is directly after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""

Based on these patterns, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately proceeding it. Additionally, the repetition occurs three times. So if the color corresponding to ""wif"" is ""red,"" then ""walm"" after ""wif"" would produce ""red red red.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.10699254416851726,52,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""walm"" appears. We will be looking for patterns that could be consistently applied across all examples.

- In the first example, ""walm"" occurs twice, and each time, it is followed by three colors, the first being red for the first occurrence and yellow for the second.
- In the second example, ""walm"" occurs once and is followed by three reds.
- In the third example, ""walm"" appears once after ""lug"" and before ""wif."" This yields a sequence of three blues for ""lug,"" a red, a yellow, and then another red for ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is the second word and it is followed by three reds.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is the second word and it is followed by three yellows.

By examining the patterns, it appears that ""walm"" results in a triplet of colors in the output. However, the color depends on the word before ""walm."" Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

- When ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" it outputs three reds.
- When ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" it outputs three yellows.
- When ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" it outputs three blues.
- The placement of ""wif"" after ""walm"" results in a red following the triplet of colors associated with ""walm.""

In all cases, ""walm"" seems to produce a triplet of colors, but the specific colors depend on the word that comes before ""walm."" The rule here is not entirely dependent on ""walm"" itself but also on the preceding word. Here is the rule based on the observed patterns:

Rule: walm -> causes the output of three consecutive colors. The specific color is determined by the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input:
- After ""wif"": red
- After ""lug"": blue
- After ""zup"": yellow

2. Input: wif lug

- ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, after ""zup"" which is consistent with being translated to ""red.""

5. Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- This is similar to the second example and ""wif"" is again followed by ""lug"" translated to ""blue"" with ""wif"" translated to ""red.""

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" no matter its position or the context.

Rule: wif -> red",-0.09035693125027396,53,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif."" Each example consists of an input with the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding output, which consists of color names. Let's analyze the examples:

1. zup wif zup => yellow red yellow
2. wif lug => red blue
3. wif lug wif => red blue red
4. lug walm zup lug zup wif => blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
5. wif lug => red blue

From these examples, we can observe that:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, its corresponding output is ""red.""
- ""wif"" does not depend on the position in the sequence to correspond to ""red"" (see examples 1 and 3).

Given this pattern, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output.",-0.14152730433671232,53,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red."" 

The ""Input"" lines contain a sequence of nonce words, and each term has a corresponding color in the ""Output"" lines. The term ""wif"" always aligns with the color ""red"" in each sequence, regardless of its position or repetition. Additionally, it is worth noting that other terms such as ""lug"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, based on their consistent pairing in the input and output sequences.

Hence, the rule is:

wif -> red",-1.2338258611945203,53,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Here is the reasoning:

- In every instance where the term ""wif"" appears, the output includes the word ""red"".
- ""wif"" appears independently without other nonce words in ""wif lug"" and ""wif lug wif"", suggesting that it directly maps to a single color rather than being contextually dependent.
- When ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" appears the same number of times as ""wif"" in the output.

Thus, the rule is:

It should be noted that ""wif"" always results in ""red,"" and ""walm"" appears to be associated with ""yellow,"" which is the same as ""zup,"" but the examples given are not sufficient to determine whether these words change meaning in other contexts—in other words, whether they act like modifiers or have a fixed translation.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern in which colors correspond to words in each given input and output example.

In the first example, when ""wif walm"" appears together, they result in ""red red red."" In the second example, ""wif walm dax"" gives us ""red red red green."" In the third example, ""dax walm"" gives us ""green green green."" In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" again results in ""red red red"". In the last example, ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color output of the word before it to repeat three times. Let's apply this rule to confirm it fits all instances:

1. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and 'red' is repeated thrice afterward.
2. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and 'red' is repeated thrice before moving to the next word ""dax,"" which is 'green.'
3. ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and 'green' is repeated thrice following it.
4. ""wif walm"" directly results in ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and 'red' is repeated thrice.
5. ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and 'blue' is repeated thrice before it moves to ""wif"" and then another ""lug.""

Therefore, we can induce the rule:

Rule: walm -> when placed after a word, it causes the color output associated with that preceding word to be repeated three times.

Example using the rule: ""XXX walm YYY"" translates into ""color_of_XXX color_of_XXX color_of_XXX color_of_YYY.""",-0.11958217792613639,53,walm
"Rule: walm -> red repeated for the number of words following ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Explanation:

1. In the first example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""walm"" is followed by no words and the output sequence ends with three reds. Since there are no words following ""walm,"" the rule of repetition based on subsequent words does not apply. However, in context with other examples, we can deduce the baseline color for ""walm"" is red.

2. In the second example, ""wif walm dax,"" ""walm"" is followed by one word ""dax,"" and the output is two reds followed by a green, which corresponds to ""dax"". 

3. In the third example, ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" is followed by no words and the output is three greens which matches the number of words before ""walm"". 

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm,"" ""walm"" has no words following it and the output is three reds, seemingly reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" translates to a series of reds.

5. The final example, ""lug walm wif lug,"" is important because it shows that ""walm"" being followed by two words (""wif lug"") results in ""walm"" translating to two reds (""blue blue blue red blue"").

The rule is not perfect, as examples 1 and 3 seem to be ambiguous and don't fit perfectly with others. However, based on the information given, the most consistent interpretation is that ""walm"" results in red color repeated for the number of words following it. The last example reinforces this by having ""walm"" followed by two words and resulting in two instances of the color red. Therefore, it is the best explanation with the given examples.",-0.5389584811939772,53,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each input word corresponds to a specific color output, and the presence of the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color output associated with the directly preceding word. Here is how the rule applies in each example:

- In the first input, ""bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" corresponds to red. Therefore, ""walm"" results in repeating the red output associated with ""wif.""
- In the second input, ""wif walm dax,"" after ""wif"" which corresponds to red, ""walm"" repeats the red and then ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- In the third input, ""lug zup dax walm,"" after ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" repeats the green color output.
- In the fourth input, ""wif walm,"" after ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" repeats the red.

- In the second example, ""wif"" again translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated twice.
- In the third example, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" alone translates to ""red"" and with ""walm"" following, ""red"" is repeated twice.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated twice followed by ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" again.

However, in the example ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" translating word by word seems to give the output ""yellow yellow blue yellow"" but the actual output replaces ""blue"" with ""yellow,"" making it look like ""bluf"" introduces an error or exception to the rule that alters the color sequence by rendering the following color as ""yellow."" No direct translation or consistent pattern has been given for ""walm,"" but it is followed by ""yellow"" in the output, suggesting that ""walm"" may also translate to ""yellow"" or that it prompts a repetition of ""zup's"" translation which is ""yellow.""

Given the available data, we can infer the following rules with regard to ""zup"":

Rule:
- ""zup"" on its own means ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""lug"" translates to ""yellow blue.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" translates to ""yellow red.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" or ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that these words may cause a repetition or reinforcement of the color ""yellow.""

Until more context is provided, especially regarding ""bluf"" and ""walm,"" and how they interact with the color sequences, the rule that these induce repeat ""yellow"" is a speculative inference.",-0.5300997895077777,54,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", as seen in the fourth example.
- ""bluf"" seems to mean ""yellow"" when followed by ""lug"" and ""zup"", as in the fifth example, the result of which is a sequence of yellows and one ""blue"".
- ""walm"" is not directly translated in the given examples, but it seems to follow the pattern of translating to ""yellow"" given that the sequence ""zup walm"" results in two ""yellow"" colors in the output.

Rule:

- wif, when following zup -> red
- bluf, when following lug and zup -> yellow

""Walm"" is not followed by a specific color in the Output but based on the pattern it may imply repeating the previous color, which in every instance was yellow.

The rule could therefore be stated as:

3. Input: lug bluf wif   -> Output: blue blue red
4. Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow

From the above examples, we notice the following:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"" consistently in all examples.
- ""wif"" sometimes duplicates the color that follows (""walm"" produces ""red"" twice, just like ""wif"").
- The presence of ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color word directly before it. 
  - In example 1, ""lug"" before ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", and the output is ""blue blue"".
  - In example 2, ""wif"" before ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", and the output is ""red red"".
  - In example 3, ""lug"" before ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", and the output is ""blue blue"" followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"".
  - In example 4, ""zup"" before ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is ""yellow yellow"".
  - In example 5, ""lug"" before ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", and the output is ""blue blue"".

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the previously mentioned word(s). Here is the analysis:

1. ""zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue"", so ""bluf"" means repeat the color of ""lug"", which is blue.
2. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"", so ""bluf"" means repeat the color of ""wif"", which is red.
3. ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red""; here ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"" again, which is blue.
4. ""wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red green yellow yellow""; ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"", which is yellow.
5. ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue""; ""bluf"" repeats the color of both ""walm"" and ""lug"", which are red and blue respectively.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color(s) of all the word(s) that come before it until a new invocation of ""bluf"".

Let's examine the evidence:

- In the first input, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and then ""bluf"" follows, also outputting ""blue.""
- In the second input, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" follows, resulting in another ""red.""
- In the third input, ""lug"" once again precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue"" followed by ""blue,"" with ""wif"" then producing ""red.""

- In the fifth input, ""walm"" does not seem to precede ""bluf"" directly, but ""lug"" does, and ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" followed again by ""blue"" from ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color word that precedes it (in the output) as many times as the color word has been mentioned before it.

Observing the following patterns:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" represents ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows, resulting in ""blue blue."" It's the first mention of blue, so it's repeated once.
2. In the second example, there's no color word before ""bluf,"" so ""red"" is mentioned twice.
3. In the third example, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" repeats the blue once after its first mention.
4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the yellow once after its first mention.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" (blue), which implies ""walm"" is also red. Thus, ""bluf"" repeats ""blue"" twice after its first mention.

Therefore, the rule is: ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color word in the output as many times as that word has appeared before ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the preceding color in the output the same number of times that color has been mentioned in the input sequence before `bluf`.",-1.0060958996733336,54,bluf
"From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" has a particular effect on the output related to color repetitions. Here is the rule I deduced:

Whenever ""walm"" appears after a word in the input, the corresponding color for that word is repeated three times in the output. Now, let's cross-verify this with the provided examples:

- Example 1: ""dax zup dax walm"" outputs ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and thus ""green"" is repeated thrice immediately following its regular occurrence.

- Example 2: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" outputs ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times immediately after its regular occurrence.

- Example 3: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" In this case, ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" so ""blue"" is repeated three times immediately after ""bluf.""

- Example 4: ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, we see ""red"" repeated three times.

- Example 5: ""dax walm zup walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" This has two instances of ""walm,"" after ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), and in both cases, we see the respective colors repeated three times each.

"Analyzing the given examples, we can start by looking for patterns related to the nonce word ""walm"" and its corresponding output. Let's break down each input and its output:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"".
   - After the introduction of ""walm,"" we see repeated ""green"" colors.
  
2. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"".
   - After ""walm,"" the ""red"" color is repeated.

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.
   - ""lug"" after ""walm"" still corresponds to ""blue"", but notice that ""dax"" after ""walm"" gives a single ""green"" before returning to ""blue,"" indicating ""walm"" has stopped its effect before ""dax.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red,"" respectively.
   - After ""walm,"" we see repeated ""red.""

5. Input: dax walm zup walm

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - After the first ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated.
   - ""zup"" after the second ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""yellow.""

From these examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat until a different word (that has its own color association) appears. Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be related to repetition or continuation of the last mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat until a different color association is introduced.",-0.07499770479239606,54,walm

   (Output is green repeated twice after the existing sequence, suggesting that ""walm"" perhaps repeats the color associated with ""dax"")

2. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red

5. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" with the color blue repeated thrice.
4. The fourth example, ""wif walm,"" again produces ""red red red,"" consistently repeating red three times.
5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing yellow repeated thrice.

3. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red, then ""bluf"" is followed by red.
- In the second example, even with the addition of ""walm"" after ""dax,"" ""bluf"" still corresponds with the red color.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and once again ""wif"" to red and ""bluf"" to red.
- In the fourth example, without any other context, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both result in red.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" yields yellow, ""lug"" yields blue, and in this context ""bluf"" yields blue.

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to either red or blue. However, ""bluf"" yields blue only in the presence of ""lug,"" which also corresponds to blue. This could mean that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word immediately before it unless it's following ""wif,"" in which case it outputs red.

From this analysis, the rule seems to be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for consistent patterns related to the examples and outputs provided.

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is green red red. Since ""dax"" corresponds to green and the second ""red"" follows ""bluf,"" it's possible that ""bluf"" alone translates to red.

2. For the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" gives us red red green green green. We know that ""dax"" should be green and from the pattern in the other examples ""wif"" is red. As the sequence goes red red preceding ""dax,"" it reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" might mean red, as ""walm"" is the only new variable that produced two greens at the end.

3. The third input ""wif dax bluf"" translates to red green green, with ""wif"" and ""dax"" already known, which again suggests that ""bluf"" translates to red since it is followed by a green that we can't account for.

4. The fourth example solidifies the pattern: ""wif bluf"" outputs red red implying that ""bluf"" is indeed red.

5. The fifth input ""zup lug bluf wif"" results in yellow blue blue red. ""Bluf"" is followed by blue, but this time is before ""wif,"" which we know is red. Since the output associated with ""bluf"" is immediately followed by the output for ""wif"" (red), it still points towards ""bluf"" being red, and the blue must be coming from ""lug.""

The discrepancy in the last example can imply that ""bluf"" may change meaning based on some element of the surrounding words since ""bluf"" corresponds to red in examples where ""wif"" and ""dax"" are also present. However, in the last example, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup lug"", it corresponds to blue. Since we don't have a clear rule for when ""bluf"" becomes blue, and it's red in a majority of the examples, the most consistent association with ""bluf"" is red, although exceptions may exist.

Since all examples except the last lead to ""bluf"" being associated with red, the rule we can extract with the information provided (and without more context to explain the fifth input) is:

bluf -> red

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red in the output sequence, with potential contextual exceptions.",-0.55950700209,55,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Explanation: Each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""bluf"" within the input sequence, the output consistently shows ""red"" for that term.",-1.6936437221259737,55,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color red. Each time the word ""bluf"" is used in an input, the corresponding output is the color red.

Rule: bluf -> red",-1.7698418254762336,55,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of a color word that was previously mentioned in the input. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times in the output. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
   - ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"", and 'walm' follows, leading to the color being repeated three times.

2. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
   - ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"", and 'walm' follows, leading to the color being repeated three times.

3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"".
   - Here ""walm"" follows ""bluf wif"", and since ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"", 'walm' causes ""red"" to be repeated three times at the end.

4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" leads to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"".
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""lug wif"", which means that the last mentioned color before ""walm"" was ""red"", coming from ""bluf"". Consequently, 'walm' causes ""red"" to be repeated three times, followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

5. ""lug walm wif lug"" leads to ""blue blue blue red blue"".
   - Here ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue"", resulting in the color ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.",-0.0608133425126813,55,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color word that precedes it. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times. Additionally, when ""walm"" is used in a sequence with other words, the color associated with it is still repeated, but the number of times seems to depend on the sequence of other words or rules governing those words.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""walm"" repeats it three times.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" repeats it three times.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Rule: ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" has no direct correspondence but seems to trigger a single ""red"" because of the ""wif"" which seems to mean ""red"" and to negate or end the repetition created by ""walm"".

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Rule: ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""bluf"" followed by ""wif"" gives a single ""red"", ""walm"" follows after ""wif"" repeats ""red"" three times, and then the sequence ends with ""lug"" meaning ""blue"".

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
Rule: ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"".

So, based on the pattern, ""walm"" seems to mean a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, although the exact number of repetitions may be affected by other factors not entirely clear from the examples.

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the pattern changes because ""wif"" does not have a color directly associated with it. Instead, ""wif"" seems to take the color of the word preceding it (""zup"" in the third example and ""lug"" in the fourth and fifth examples) and ""walm"" repeats that color two times fewer than before because ""wif"" takes one iteration of the color for itself.

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word. 

For example, ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" because the color for ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""walm"" means repeating that color three times.

2. The combination ""lug dax"" produces ""blue green""
   - Input: lug dax walm

   - We can infer that ""walm"" means green.

3. When ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" the output sequence starts with ""green blue""

4. The sequence ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" produces ""blue red red green blue blue""
   - We can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" within this sequence and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in both appearances. The output for ""dax"" is ""green"" here as well.

Given these observations, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of the words before or after it in the examples. Each appearance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in each output sequence. Thus, we can deduce the rule:

"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""lug"" by comparing its occurrences and their associated outputs.

In every instance where ""lug"" appears, the output includes the color ""blue"". We can see that regardless of its position in the input sentence, ""lug"" consistently results in the color ""blue"" being part of the output. In contrast, the word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"" and ""wif"" with the color ""red"", and these colors occur the same number of times as their associated words in the input.

The meaning or rule behind other words can be speculated as follows:

- ""wif"" always maps to ""red""
- ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" usually maps to ""yellow,"" but its exact rule is unclear since it doesn't appear without a ""wif"" or ""dax"" preceding it.
- ""walm"" always maps to ""red"" when it appears after ""dax"" or ""zup,"" and it occurs twice after ""zup"" in the second input.
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" when it appears after ""dax"" or as a standalone word.

However, since the task is only to determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we stick with the established rule for ""dax.""",-0.9117015715563918,56,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" signifies the start of a color sequence. Following the appearance of ""dax,"" the nonce words ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" are associated with specific colors. The sequence of colors after ""dax"" seems to follow a rule where each nonce word corresponds to a color.

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow when following ""dax,"" but it does not follow the pattern if not preceded by ""dax"" (it's green in the fifth input when ""dax"" appears after it).
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color red when preceding ""wif,"" and yellow otherwise.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

The word ""dax"" itself always leads to the color green at the start of the sequence.

Thus, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be that it always translates to the color green and signals the start of a sequence, with the following words translating to particular colors based on the correspondence mentioned above, except for the unique behavior of ""bluf"" and ""walm"" depending on their position relative to ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",-0.9410927868829898,56,dax

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""red.""

"Given the examples, it seems that ""dax"" serves as an indicator for a color pattern rather than a specific color on its own. To determine the rule for ""dax,"" let's look at the provided input-output pairs to identify patterns:

- When ""wif"" appears immediately after ""dax,"" the output is green followed by red.
- When ""zup"" appears immediately after ""dax,"" the output is green followed by yellow.
- When ""lug"" appears immediately after ""dax,"" the output is green followed by blue.

It is also notable that the appearance of ""dax"" in the middle of the sequence results in producing green at the corresponding position, suggesting that ""dax"" translates directly to green and influences the color of the word that follows.

So, based on the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule:
- ""dax"" directly translates to the color green.
- The word immediately following ""dax"" determines the next color in the sequence as follows:
  - ""wif"" following ""dax"" results in red.
  - ""zup"" following ""dax"" results in yellow.
  - ""lug"" following ""dax"" results in blue.

Given these observations, we can write the rule as:

For each case, we will identify the color related to ""wif"" based on the outputs.

2. ""Wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""lug"" which correspond to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, with ""wif"" having ""red"" before them. ""Bluf"" is at the end and matches ""blue blue"", so ""wif"" remains ""red"".

4. ""Bluf"" relates to ""blue"" (""bluf"" is also at the end of the sentence), so ""wif"" before ""bluf"" is ""red"", with ""dax"" being ""green"".

"Given the examples provided, when attempting to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif,"" one must look at the direct correlation between the inputs and outputs. When analyzing the patterns, it becomes apparent how the input corresponds to the output.

In the first example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' and 'walm' corresponds to 'red.' The sequence 'wif walm' in the second example results in 'red red,' which implies that 'wif' also corresponds to 'red.' However, without further examination, it would be too simplistic to assume that 'wif' means 'red' because we need to account for the varying context in different occurrences.

Looking at the third example, 'wif' is followed by 'red,' even after different words like 'zup' and 'lug;' and considering 'bluf' translates to 'blue' in the second example but 'wif' still translates to 'red' in the fourth example, regardless of 'bluf' being present, it is consistent that 'wif' translates to 'red.'

In the fifth example, 'dax' precedes 'wif' and 'bluf' follows, but regardless of their sequence, 'wif' still gives the output 'red.'

With these observations, while taking into account the positions and sequences that have changed, the common consistency is that each occurrence of 'wif' results in the output 'red,' regardless of its position or surrounding words.

- In the first example, ""wif"" normally outputs red, and when it comes after ""walm"", it outputs red as well.
- In the second example, ""dax"" normally outputs green, but when it comes after ""walm"", it outputs red.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" normally outputs blue, but after ""walm"", it outputs red.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and once again, the output for ""wif"" turns to red, consistent with the previous rule application.

Therefore, we can postulate the following rule:

walm -> Changes the color of the following word to red.",-1.1688299298948885,56,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to trigger a change in the color pattern being output. The color before ""walm"" is repeated after ""walm,"" but with a switch from green/red to red, or yellow/blue to blue. To break it down:

1. In the first example: ""green"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green red,"" suggesting a switch from green to red.
2. In the second example: ""red"" precedes ""walm"" and the output after ""walm"" is also red.
3. In the third example: ""blue"" precedes ""walm"" and the output after ""walm"" is also blue.
4. In the fourth example: ""red"" precedes ""walm"" and the output after ""walm"" is again red.
5. In the fifth example: ""green"" precedes ""walm,"" the output switches from ""green green green"" to ""red red red"" continuing the pattern of the first example.

If we synthesize the information:

- When the color green is followed by ""walm,"" it changes to red.
- When the color red is followed by ""walm,"" it stays red.
- When the color blue is followed by ""walm,"" it stays blue.

It appears that ""walm"" acts as a toggle for the color green to switch to red, while it acts as a signal to maintain the output color if it is anything other than green (in this case, red or blue).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as:

Rule: When walm follows a color, it outputs the following: if the color is green, it changes the output to red; if the color is any other color presented in the examples (red or blue), it maintains that color as the output.

4. Input: dax

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be an element that takes on the characteristic of the word immediately preceding it in terms of the output color. If we analyze the examples given:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
5. wif bluf -> red red

From examples 1, 2, 3, and 5, we can see that whenever ""bluf"" follows another word, the color output of ""bluf"" matches the color output of that preceding word:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" following ""dax"" also corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" following ""zup"" also corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" following ""wif"" also corresponds to red.

Example 4 further supports this as ""zup bluf"" results in yellow yellow, and when ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"", which on its own would result in blue, ""bluf"" does not affect the output color of ""lug"".

Rule: bluf -> takes on the output color of the preceding word.",-0.11245618167845067,57,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we will analyze the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. In each input, ""bluf"" is associated with a specific response in the output, regardless of the other words present.

Let's examine the color responses tied to ""bluf"" in each instance:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the second green

2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the second yellow

3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the second red

4. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the second yellow

5. wif bluf -> red red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the second red

Considering the outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" always results in the output color being repeated. In each case, the color response to ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. From this pattern, we can induce a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Therefore, the induction for the nonce word ""bluf"" based on the given examples:

bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.11622407123866196,57,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""reduplicate the color associated with the preceding word.""

Explanation:
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""bluf"" the color green is reduplicated in the output as ""green green."" ""Bluf"" does not affect ""zup,"" which has its own color, yellow.
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and it is reduplicated as ""yellow yellow"" following ""bluf.""
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, which is reduplicated as ""red red,"" and ""lug"" has its own color, which is blue.
- In ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" we see the pattern again with ""zup"" becoming ""yellow yellow"" after ""bluf,"" followed by the independent colors for ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green), with ""lug"" repeated as the final word with its assigned color.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is red, and with ""bluf"" immediately following, it is reduplicated as ""red red.""

Thus, ""bluf -> meaning"" can be summarized as ""bluf"" causing the immediate repetition of the color associated with the word before it.",-0.27507831587028164,57,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Checking the inputs where ""bluf"" is used, we see the following pairings:

1. ""dax bluf"" is followed by ""green green""
2. ""zup bluf"" is followed by ""yellow yellow""
3. ""wif bluf"" is followed by ""red red""

We can observe that in each case, the color output after ""bluf"" matches the color of the word before ""bluf."" Hence, we can deduce that ""bluf"" acts as a repeater or duplicator of the previous color or perhaps the word itself. Based on this observation, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> repeat previous word or color

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word.",-0.7105556382409859,57,bluf
"From the provided examples, it appears that 'bluf' results in an output that is one word repeated twice in color format. The color outputs seem to correspond to the first word before 'bluf' with the following patterns:

- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red""

Thus, it seems that 'bluf' is a rule that dictates the color associated with a particular word must be repeated twice in the output. Here is the rule induction based on the examples provided:

"walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word preceding it three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times. For example:

- ""zup walm"" yielded ""yellow yellow yellow"", with ""zup"" associated with yellow, and ""walm"" leading to the color ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translated to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" before ""walm"" is associated with yellow, so ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" generated ""green green green"", with ""dax"" associated with green, and ""walm"" leading to the color ""green"" repeated three times.

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats this word three times.
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" outputs ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"", where the last ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats this word three times.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the preceding unique nonce word. The number of repetitions seems to correspond to the number of letters in the unique nonce word that precedes ""walm.""

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""zup"" has three letters. Thus ""walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the sequence ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the last unique nonce word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow and has three letters, leading to ""walm"" producing ""yellow yellow yellow"" even though ""wif"" and ""lug"" occurred in between.

2. ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue"", which confirms the consistency of the input-output relationship for ""lug"" and ""walm"".
3. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"", which indicates that ""zup"" might correspond to yellow and ""wif"" to red.

   Analysis: ""zup"" represents yellow, and ""wif"" represents red; since ""walm"" followed ""wif"", the output for ""walm"" is red.

2. Example: ""zup walm""

   Analysis: ""zup"" represents yellow; since ""walm"" directly followed ""zup"", the output for ""walm"" is yellow.

3. Example: ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif""
   Output: ""red red green green red red red blue red""
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" followed ""wif"" (which represents red) in this sequence, thus the output for ""walm"" is red.

4. Example: ""zup walm""

   Analysis: As before, ""zup"" represents yellow, so ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in the color yellow.

5. Example: ""dax walm zup lug""

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" is directly associated with repeating the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it thrice. To analyze this, we can look at the output corresponding to each input where ""walm"" is used:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red."" Therefore, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
  
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" must correspond to yellow, and again ""walm"" leads to this color being repeated three times.
  
- In the third input, ""wif walm"" appears again, and just like in the first example, it outputs ""red red red,"" reinforcing the rule deduced.
  
- The fourth example repeats the second one and it provides the same output, which offers further confirmation of our rule.
  
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" with ""dax"" corresponding to green and ""walm"" again causing this color to be repeated three times.

"Based on the given examples, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" is translated to a consistent color irrespective of the surrounding context. The repeated input ""zup walm"" consistently outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow"".

In the third example, ""walm"" in the presence of other words still results in the output of red repeated for each instance preceding it, which indicates it's likely that ""walm"" corresponds to the color of the word that comes before it whenever it appears. However, since it follows the pattern of the word before it (in this case ""wif"" which apparently translates as ""red""), and since ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") in the final example and is translated as ""green"", it suggests that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word directly preceding it.

Therefore, we could induce the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color value of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before it, or if the logic of the surrounding words does not dictate otherwise, it defaults to ""yellow"".",-1.3413224116101121,59,walm
"From examining the examples provided, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""walm"" changes its meaning based on the word that appears immediately before it. Here's the pattern:

- When there is no word preceding ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red"" (derived from the second input line example which stands alone without a word before it).
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""green green green.""

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the color output (repeating it three times) of the word immediately before it — or red when it stands alone. Here's the rule:

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the word ""lug"" by comparing the inputs and outputs.

In the first example ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green"". Since ""dax"" appears alone at another point and also corresponds to ""green"", we can infer that ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue"".

This seems to hold true in subsequent examples:

- Input: ""lug bluf zup"" Output: ""blue blue yellow""
  Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" seems to correspond to another ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

- Input: ""wif lug dax walm"" Output: ""red blue green green green""
  Here ""lug"" appears between ""wif"" and ""dax"" and the corresponding colors are ""red blue green"". Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" most likely corresponds to ""blue"" here as well.

- Input: ""dax walm zup lug walm"" Output: ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
  Here ""lug"" precedes the last ""walm"" which corresponds to a repetition of the color ""green"". The output ""blue"" after ""yellow"" is likely from ""lug"", suggesting a rule that ""lug"" means ""blue"".

- Input: ""dax lug wif bluf"" Output: ""green blue red red""
  Again, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", while the other words map to their corresponding colors as deduced from previous examples.

Given the consistency across these examples, it is reasonable to conclude that the rule for ""lug"" is that it corresponds to the color ""blue"".

"Rule: lug -> blue

Explanation:
- In all the examples provided, whenever 'lug' is mentioned, the color 'blue' appears in the output. 
- 'lug dax' translates to 'blue green', with 'lug' corresponding to 'blue'.
- When 'lug' is combined with other words like 'bluf' or 'zup', each of those words corresponds to a color as well, but 'lug' consistently corresponds to 'blue'.
- The repetition of the other words (like 'dax' always corresponding to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', etc.) in different contexts helps to isolate the meaning of 'lug' as 'blue'.

"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns of input and output:

1. Whenever 'lug' appears, 'blue' is part of the output.
2. 'lug' seems to directly correspond with 'blue', regardless of the position in the sequence:

- In example 3, 'lug' is second, and the second color in the output is 'blue'.
- In example 4, 'lug' is fourth, following 'yellow' and preceding two 'blue' outputs. Given the output pattern, 'lug' corresponds to the first 'blue' following 'yellow'.
- In example 5, 'lug' is again second and the output has 'blue' second.

This consistency suggests that the word 'lug' directly translates to the color 'blue' irrespective of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Additionally, there are no examples where 'lug' is influencing the color that comes after it unless it is directly preceded or followed by another 'lug'.

Looking at the examples, it seems that the presence of the word ""bluf"" leads to ""blue"" being in the output sequence. In instances where ""bluf"" appears, it has been followed by the word ""blue"" in the output.

Here's the deduction:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" in the input, the ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""bluf"" to ""green"" as well (Example 1).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue"" (Examples 2, 3, 4, and 5).

However, we need to look at more examples to confirm this hypothesis.

In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" which supports our hypothesis, as the output for ""bluf"" is still blue, just like our hypothesis of ""green"" was a color.

In the third and fourth examples, ""lug bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue blue."" This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" represents a color, as ""blue"" follows ""lug"" each time. The consistency here is strong evidence.

"From the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" produces a series of colors that follow the color produced by the word just before it. Each of the previous words appears to have a color association:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green
- ""zup"" to yellow
- ""wif"" to red
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue

When ""walm"" follows these words, the output is a series of three colors that match the color associated with the directly preceding word.

So, based on the examples provided:

- In ""dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is green, so it results in three greens.
- In ""zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which is yellow, so it results in three yellows.
- In ""wif walm"", ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which is red, so it results in three reds.
- In ""wif dax lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which is blue, so it results in three blues.
- In ""dax lug walm"", even though ""dax"" is mentioned earlier, ""walm"" directly follows ""lug"", which is blue, so it results in three blues, ignoring the green associated with ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: walm outputs a series of three of the same color that is associated with the directly preceding word.

Each word preceding 'walm' corresponds to a specific color: 'dax' to green, 'zup' to yellow, 'wif' to red, 'lug' to blue. When 'walm' follows any of these words, that word's corresponding color is repeated three times, except in the case where multiple color-words precede 'walm' without interruption, in which case the pattern is to use each color once followed by three repetitions of the last color.

The rule seems to be as follows:

- 'dax' corresponds to the color green
- 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow
- 'wif' corresponds to the color red
- 'lug' corresponds to the color blue

When the word 'walm' is used, it indicates that the color associated with the immediately preceding word should be repeated three times, unless there are multiple color-associated words before 'walm' grouped together, then it is each color once followed by the last color three times.

2. Input: ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green"".
   - Here, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and since ""dax"" is between ""yellow"" and ""green"", it is likely that ""dax"" here also means ""green"".

3. Input: ""dax zup dax"" corresponds to ""green yellow green"".
   - This confirms the pattern as ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position relative to ""zup"" which means ""yellow"".

4. Input: ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"".
   - ""dax"" follows ""lug"", which means ""blue"", and is followed by ""zup"" which means ""yellow"". The corresponding output for ""dax"" is ""green"".

5. Input: ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green"".

However, when ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" in ""lug bluf"" or ""wif"" in ""lug wif bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to red in the output.

From this, we might initially think that ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" because it corresponds with ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is present.

- With ""lug"" before it (which corresponds to ""blue""), ""bluf"" means ""blue blue.""
- With ""wif"" following it (which corresponds to ""red""), ""bluf"" changes the pattern to ""red red.""

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" and to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" or ""lug."" It appears that ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the previous word in the sequence. If we are to construct a rule, it seems that ""bluf"" carries the color of the word before it, with some specific predetermined exceptions (e.g., with ""zup"" it is always yellow).

This discrepancy suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" may depend on the context, such as the position of the word ""bluf"" in the input string or the adjacent words.

Seeing as ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" but to ""red"" in other contexts, the rule appears to be related to the preceding word. When ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow."" In all other instances, it translates to ""red.""

- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"". The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and after walm, it's repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", hence ""zup"" must mean ""yellow"" and it is also repeated three times after walm.
- ""lug dax walm wif"" gives ""blue green green green red"", where ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""dax"" means ""green"". Since walm follows ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated three times. ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" leads to ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". Here ""lug"" precedes walm, so ""blue"" is repeated three times after walm. The rest follows the colors assigned to each word.
- ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue"". Again ""lug"" is before walm, leading to ""blue"" being repeated three times.

"After assessing the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- The appearance of ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- The occurrence of ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- The word ""zup"" converts to ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" converts to ""red"".

When ""walm"" is combined with these words, it seems to replicate the color associated with the word that appears before ""walm"". Here are the observations:

1. In the first example ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" represents ""green,"" and the output is ""green green green."" There are three repetitions of ""green.""
2. In the second example ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" represents ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" There are three repetitions of ""yellow.""
3. In the third example ""lug dax walm wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The output is ""blue green green green red,"" where ""walm"" after ""dax"" causes the ""green"" to be repeated three times.
4. In the fourth example ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" we can deduce:
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green,""
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue,""
   - there are two instances of ""walm,"" after ""lug"" and ""dax,"" which in both cases result in repeating the previous color three times (""blue blue blue"" and ""green green green,"" respectively),
   - ""wif"" as noted before means ""red,""
   - ""bluf"" has a trailing ""red"" for which there is no clearly established pattern, but it likely means ""red"" as well.
5. In the fifth example ""dax lug walm,"" following the patterns in previous examples, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in repeating ""blue"" three times.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" after a color word causes the output to repeat that color word three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word before it to be repeated three times.",-0.24150438358905885,62,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes just before it. 

For example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat twice more for a total of three times. Similarly, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" causing it to be repeated twice more. 

Also, based on the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" continues to repeat the color of the word that came before it until a new color word appears. In the example ""lug dax walm wif"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and then ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" three times until ""wif"" changes the color to ""red"". In the example ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"", ""walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat three times after ""lug"" before it encounters another ""dax,"" which changes the color to ""green""; then ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" apparently also leads to ""red"" (though ""bluf"" is not explicitly defined, it's deduced from the repeated ""red""). 

Walm -> Repeats the color output of the preceding word until a new color word appears.",-0.5069057611313177,62,walm
"From the given examples, we can deduce that the walm in the context directly relates to repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it thrice. For instance, when ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"", indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times. Similarly, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", implying that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

Looking at the more complex sentences, we see ""lug dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green green green red"", here ""lug"" is followed by blue, ""dax"" by green, and ""walm"" causes the green to repeat three times. ""Wif"" comes afterward and translates to red. In the fourth example, ""lug"" and ""dax"" maintain their associations with blue and green, respectively, and each occurrence of ""walm"" again causes the preceding color to triple. ""Bluf"" seems to relate to the color red, given that when it follows ""dax"", the sequence ""green red red green"" is observed, suggesting it interrupts the repetition caused by ""walm"" and then the pattern resumes.

Therefore, walm -> meaning is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.

"From the given examples, we can induce the following pattern:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup"", the output is ""yellow red red yellow"". The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the start and end, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The word ""bluf"" is surrounded by the word ""zup"" which equates to ""yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" in this case.

2. In the second example, ""wif lug zup bluf"", the output is ""red blue yellow yellow"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as previously established. The outcome for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" following ""zup"".

3. The third example, ""dax bluf"", where the output is ""green green"", indicates that ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" when following ""dax"".

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". Similar to example two, ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"" following ""zup"".

5. The fifth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"", gives the output ""green green green red red"", indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" likely corresponds to ""green"" as well (or maybe the repetition of ""green"" is influenced by having ""dax"" at the beginning), and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""bluf"" in this case results in ""red red"", following ""wif"".

By analyzing the examples, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the word that precedes it. Here is the rule one could deduce:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is determined by the color associated with the word immediately before it. It either repeats the same color or, in the case of ""wif"", it repeats the color twice. 

Based on the rule, the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent and follows this pattern:
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" is yellow.
- After ""dax"" (green), ""bluf"" is green.
- After ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" results in a duplication of red (""red red"").

Thus, the rule-induced definition is:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is context-dependent and follows the rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word; with ""wif"" specifically, the color red is repeated twice.",-0.10938591655223374,63,bluf
"To determine what ""bluf"" represents, let's look at the correspondence between the input and output:

1. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
2. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

Observations:
- In example 1, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup,"" which are translated to ""red yellow."" The output is ""yellow red red yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is at the end after ""zup,"" and the corresponding output ends in ""yellow yellow."" This again suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""yellow.""
- Example 3 shows ""dax bluf"" and the output is ""green green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and also appears to translate to ""green.""
- Example 4 only has ""zup bluf"" and it outputs ""yellow yellow,"" indicating here that ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is at the end after ""wif,"" and the output ends with ""red red,"" so in this instance, ""bluf"" appears to be ""red.""

It seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. We can construct the rule as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word directly before it. If the word before is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" If it is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" and if it is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the input and output sequences across the given examples. Here is the analysis:

Examples with ""bluf"":
1. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
2. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

In every instance where ""bluf"" is present, the output includes a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf.""

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red"" where red corresponds to ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" corresponding to ""zup"" that comes right before it.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is directly translated into double of the color corresponding to the word before it. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red"" consistent with the color correspondence to ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates into the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it, repeated twice. 

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word twice.",-0.11901421660680517,63,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the word that occurs before it. Let's analyze the examples:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. When preceded by ""lug zup,"" the output is also ""yellow"" but repeated twice since ""lug"" does not appear to influence the word ""bluf.""
3. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
4. In the example with multiple words, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color attributed to ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and it is repeated based on the number of times ""wif"" appears before ""bluf.""

So it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word, with the number of repetitions based on how frequently that preceding word appears before ""bluf.""

The rule for ""bluf"" could be summarized as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word before bluf, repeating as many times as the preceding word appears in a sequence before ""bluf."" 

Examples:
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" so ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow.""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green.""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" so ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""red red,"" since ""wif"" appears twice in sequence before ""bluf.""",-0.9285158636090242,63,bluf

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and when duplicated as in ""walm walm,"" which translates to ""red red,"" it seems to imply duplication or repetition for the following word.
- ""wif"" translates to ""yellow,"" and when it appears multiple times as in ""walm wif walm,"" the ""yellow"" is equally multiplied.
- Each time ""zup"" appears, it is followed by ""yellow,"" and the instances beyond the first ""zup"" are determined by the following word. 

Given that ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" and sometimes followed by additional ""yellow"" repetitions based on the subsequent word, we can deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and it additionally implies that the color of the next word in the sequence should be repeated. 

However, in the example ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is followed by only a single ""yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" simply means ""yellow,"" and the duplication effect might be caused by the word following ""zup"" rather than by ""zup"" itself.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when it appears in a sequence. However, its presence also causes duplication of the subsequent color names in the output. The word following ""zup"" is repeated once, and for each occurrence of ""walm"" following ""zup"", ""red"" is repeated one additional time compared to the last instance. 

For example, in the third input, ""zup walm wif walm"", ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"", the next word ""walm"" to ""red"", and because ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow red red"". ""Wif"" translated to ""yellow"", and the next ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times because it's the second occurrence of ""walm"" after ""zup"".

Similarly, in the last example, ""lug"" follows ""zup,"" hence ""blue"" is repeated once. Since there are two instances of ""walm"" after ""zup"", ""green"" (translated from ""walm"") is repeated twice each time.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" and causes the next color name in the sequence to be duplicated once, and for each subsequent ""walm"", ""red"" is duplicated one additional time more than the previous count of ""red"".",-1.036883630081818,64,zup

"To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" I will examine the patterns and outputs corresponding to the presence or absence of the word ""walm"" in the given examples.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Comparing examples that have and do not have 'walm':

- In the first, second, and third examples, whenever walm appears, the output that follows is a string of 'red'. 

- In the fourth example, where 'walm' appears at the end, three 'yellow' (corresponding to ""zup walm"") follow. 

- In the fifth example, where 'walm' is in the middle, directly after 'walm' we have a sequence of 'yellow' until another word ('lug') appears.

These consistent patterns lead to the following rule: when 'walm' appears, the following colors in the output will be 'red' unless another word appears after 'walm', in which case the color until the next word is 'yellow'.

Rule: walm -> The color for the output turns red following 'walm' until another word appears; if it is followed immediately by another word, the color is yellow until another word appears.",-0.09144680854706248,66,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs. We will look at the position of the word ""walm"" in the input and the corresponding color sequence in the output to identify patterns.

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   
2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Analyzing the examples:

- Example 1: The presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" and before ""wif"" results in ""green green green red"" output, which implies three green outputs followed by a red.
- Example 2: The presence of ""walm"" at the end after ""wif"" results in all red outputs.
- Example 3: Again ""walm"" following ""wif"" leads to all red outputs.
- Example 4: ""Walm"" at the end after ""zup"" led to three yellow outputs.
- Example 5: ""Walm"" preceding ""lug"" and following ""zup"" resulted in three yellow outputs followed by blue.

Observations:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the corresponding output colors are yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the corresponding output colors are green, except for the last color which is red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or ends a sequence, the corresponding output colors turn completely red.
- When ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" there is no immediate pattern regarding the color transition from yellow to blue.

Based on these observations, let's propose a potential rule for ""walm"":

Rule:
- ""Walm"" seems to trigger a sequence of identical color outputs corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm,"" except when specific conditions are met, like ""walm"" being the final word or preceding ""lug."" In such cases, ""walm"" is followed by a red color (if it is the final word) or by its conditional output (like blue when preceding ""lug"").

Given that ""lug"" has not been defined and these are just nonce words, I cannot provide a direct meaning for ""walm,"" but based on the context of the examples, I deduce that:

walm -> Walm seems to be a rule that changes the output color sequence depending on the preceding words or its position in the sequence. The detailed mechanism of change depends on specific conditions we have observed in the examples but may not be limited to those conditions alone.",-0.10129329040462495,66,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the commonalities and differences in each given example and their respective outputs. Here's the analysis of each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" might correspond to ""green"" but we need more data to confirm.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" at the end results in ""red"" this time.

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is still ""red"", which indicates that ""walm"" might not be influencing the color directly or is the same as ""wif"".

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" but this time the output changes to ""yellow"".
   
5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" is at the end again and corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces ""yellow"".

From these examples, we observe that:

- ""walm"" seems to be context-dependent.
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output color is green. When preceded by ""zup,"" the output color is yellow. This suggests that ""walm"" takes on the color value corresponding to the word that precedes it.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it does not seem to change the color red that ""wif"" corresponds to.
- When ""zup"" and ""walm"" are together without ""wif"" in between, the output is consistent with the color for ""zup"".

So the consistent rule that can be derived from the examples is:

Rule: The word ""walm"" changes its output to match the output of the word that precedes it, except when combined with the word ""wif,"" where it does not change the red output associated with ""wif.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""walm"" assumes the output color of the preceding word unless it follows ""wif"" where it either becomes or remains ""red"".",-0.10178495641467496,66,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern of inputs and corresponding outputs.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

First, let's establish the meanings of the other words based on consistency across the examples:
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" directly before ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""

Noticing the pattern, ""walm"" seems to take on the same color as the word immediately preceding it, unless it is followed by ""wif"", in which case ""walm"" translates to ""red"". 

Based on these observations, we can state the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" translates to the same color as the word immediately before it, except when it is followed by the word ""wif"", in which case it translates to ""red"".",-0.11110888692250005,66,walm
"From the examples provided, each ""Input"" sequence corresponds to an ""Output"" sequence with a series of colored outputs. To infer the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the output when ""walm"" is present versus when it is absent.

Observing the examples where ""walm"" is present:

1. ""dax walm wif"" -> Output: green green green red
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: yellow red red red
3. ""wif walm"" -> Output: red red red
4. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. ""zup walm lug"" -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Notice in examples 1, 2, and 3, ""walm"" seems to be associated with a series of ""red"" outputs. However, in example 4, when ""walm"" appears at the end of the sequence, the output is a series of ""yellow"" instead. Similarly, example 5 ends with ""lug"" but has a series of ""yellow"" before it due to ""walm.""

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color tied to the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" the following output repeats ""red.""
- In example 3, since ""wif"" is the only word before ""walm,"" it results in the repetition of ""red.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" therefore, the output is a repetition of ""yellow.""
- In example 5, again we see that ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and hence the output features repeated ""yellow"" after ""walm,"" before ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

If by ""meaning,"" it is meant the function of ""walm"" in the sequence, then:

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we will look at each instance of ""wif"" in the examples provided and determine what consistent pattern or rule applies to the output. Let's examine each case:

1. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""wif"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""lug"", and the output is ""red"" between two ""blue""s. Also, ""wif"" appears at the end followed by ""red"".

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" appears after ""bluf"" and the output is ""red"" followed by multiple ""red""s.

3. Input: zup wif lug
   Output: yellow red blue
   - ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" and the output is ""red"".

4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" appears between two ""dax"" and the output is ""red"" between two ""green""s.

5. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   - ""wif"" appears at the start and the output starts with ""red"".

Now let's look for patterns:
- Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red"" irrespective of its position or the words it's adjacent to.
- ""wif"" does not seem to influence the color output of the words around it, as they vary.

These observations suggest that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its context within the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.05730459358295789,67,wif
"Based on the provided examples, where ""wif"" appears between two identical or different nonce words, and considering the output, it seems that ""wif"" precedes a change in the output color sequence.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. lug wif lug -> blue red blue
2. zup wif lug -> yellow red blue
3. dax wif dax -> green red green
4. wif zup -> red yellow
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (Here ""wif"" is followed by three reds, which could indicate that the presence of ""bluf"" before ""wif"" could be influencing this pattern, or that ""walm"" contributes to the number of reds that follow.)

From the above, ""wif"" seems to signal a transition or indicates that a red will follow. When ""wif"" is between two non-identical terms, a red appears between the colors that represent those terms. When ""wif"" is between two identical terms, it still outputs a red and then repeats the color. When ""wif"" is at the beginning of a sequence, it outputs a red followed by the colors that represent the following terms.

Rule: wif -> introduces a red in the sequence or signals a transition marked by red.",-0.8174288063778952,67,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" is used to switch the color associated with the next word. Each nonce word (lug, walm, zup, bluf, and dax) seems to correlate with a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green

When the word ""wif"" is used, it changes the color that follows to red. So, to describe the rule for ""wif"":

wif -> Changes the next color to red

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Observing the patterns, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.3587063339745313,67,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule: In each example, 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'.",-1.6031801886500008,67,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like the word ""bluf"" consistently correlates to the color ""yellow"". However, in the third and the last examples, we see ""bluf"" translating to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, which disagrees with the initial observation.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   If ""bluf"" corresponded to blue, then ""wif"" wouldn't be ""red"" in this instance.
   
2. zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, if ""bluf"" were blue, there wouldn't be two consecutive yellows in the output, hence ""bluf"" is not blue.

3. lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   ""Bluf"" produces green here, showing inconsistency with example 1 and 2 if ""bluf"" were to mean yellow.

4. wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   ""Bluf"" appears to be red in this instance, not matching with previous examples.

5. zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   Here ""bluf"" indicates red, again not consistent with the initial examples where it would seem yellow.

These inconsistencies suggest that ""bluf"" does not directly translate to a specific color. Instead, ""bluf"" likely corresponds to a rule based on its position or context within the sequence. Given the outputs cannot be directly derived without additional context or rules for each example, there is no clear, singular meaning of the word ""bluf"".

From the data provided, the rule for ""bluf"" cannot be conclusively determined. It requires more information or examples to define a consistent pattern or rule for this nonce word. Therefore, it is not possible to state a definitive rule for ""bluf"" based on the examples given.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be determined from the examples provided; it does not consistently translate to a single color. More information or examples are necessary to deduce the rule.",-0.06202688517519997,67,bluf
"Based on the provided examples:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""

In each example, the appearance of ""bluf"" correlates with the word ""yellow"" immediately followed by ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" stands alone, it translates to ""red."" Additionally, ""bluf"" seems to take on a different color meaning each time it appears, and the color it represents is not consistently placed after it, as in example 3, where ""bluf"" stands between ""green"" and ""red.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be context-dependent, potentially following a pattern dependent on the surrounding words. However, we need a more consistent and explicit pattern from the given data to determine a definitive rule. Therefore, based on the examples provided:

Rule: ""bluf"" may indicate the word ""red,"" as it does in the third and fourth examples when it stands alone, but when it is placed in a sequence, it might translate to the last color mentioned before it, as seen in the first and second examples. However, there is not enough consistent information to deduce a definitive meaning or rule for ""bluf"" across all examples.

"Based on the given examples, we can induce that:

- When ""zup"" occurs, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" occurs, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" occurs, the output is ""red.""
- When ""dax"" occurs, the output is ""green.""

In every example where ""bluf"" occurs, the output is ""yellow"" if preceded by ""zup,"" ""blue"" if preceded by ""lug,"" and ""red"" if preceded by ""wif."" There is no occurrence of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" to determine its behavior in such a case directly. However, we notice that when ""bluf"" appears without a preceding word to define its color, the output is still ""red"" as in ""Input: wif bluf dax.""

From this information, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means ""red."" However, when preceded by another color word, ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the preceding word (e.g., ""zup"" for yellow and ""lug"" for blue). This suggests that ""bluf"" may behave as a chameleon word, copying the color value of the word immediately before it in the sequence if there is one, and defaulting to ""red"" otherwise.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns related to its use and the corresponding outputs. Let's breakdown each provided line:

1. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

2. lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

3. dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

5. wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Looking at the input examples corresponding to the outputs, we observe:

- Whenever the word ""walm"" is used, it is followed by a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes ""walm"". For example:
  - In example 1, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" meaning the word ""lug"" that comes before ""walm"" becomes doubled in the output.
  - In example 2, ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue.""
  - In example 3, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" tripling the color result of ""dax.""
  - In example 4, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" tripling the color result of ""wif.""
  - In example 5, ""wif walm"" also leads to ""red red red.""

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: Repeat the color word that comes immediately before ""walm"", with the repetition count dependent on what word ""walm"" follows (either double or triple the preceding color).

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color name in the output, with the number of repetitions determined by the word preceding ""walm"".",-0.06979974712582078,67,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided.

First Example:
Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" observed from the repetition of ""lug"" and ""blue"" in the first three tokens of input and output.
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" observed from the last token of the input and output.
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" observed from the appearance after first ""walm.""

Second Example:
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

- Consistency is seen with ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""wif"" as ""red.""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" matching the first example.

Third Example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

- ""dax"" seems to produce ""green.""

Fourth Example:
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

- ""lug"" is consistently ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

Fifth Example:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

- Consistency in ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""dax"" as ""green,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

Now we can look for the pattern specifically for ""walm."" In the examples, each time ""walm"" is used, the following patterns are observed:
- In example 1, the output associated with ""walm"" is ""blue,"" which replicates the previous color (from ""lug""). In example 2, ""walm"" retains the color ""blue"" from ""lug"" again.
- In the third example, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color ""green"" from ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" produces a sequence of ""red"" after ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, after ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in repeated ""red"" again.

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word. So if the word before ""walm"" has a color, ""walm"" keeps that color consistent for its output.

Walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.06993432743428302,67,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the provided examples. We should look for patterns that involve ""walm"" and try to see how it affects the output.

1. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

2. lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

3. dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

5. wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Here's what we can deduce:
- In the first example, ""walm"" appears between ""lug"" and ""zup"", and based on the pattern, it repeats the color before it which is ""blue"", hence the output for ""walm"" is two additional ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows directly after ""lug"". The output shows an additional ""blue"" indicating that ""walm"" also repeats the color before it.
- In the third example, ""dax"" on its own would correspond to ""green"", but the inclusion of ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two more times.
- In the fourth example, the presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to three ""red"" in the output, indicating a repetition of the color before ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and we see two more ""red"" in the output, indicating a repetition again.

From these observations, we can infer a pattern where ""walm"" causes the word before it to repeat its corresponding color two additional times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the previous word's associated color to repeat two more times.",-0.07441208466783018,67,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is a sequence of ""blue."" For example:

   - Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   - Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is a sequence of ""green"":

   - Input: dax walm
   - Output: green green green

3. When ""walm"" is in the sequence without ""lug"" or ""dax"" preceding it directly, it still results in a sequence of the same color, which matches the color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm"":

   - Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   - Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

   - Input: wif walm dax zup
   - Output: red red red green yellow

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to be a rule that repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. Here's how it can be defined:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the word that comes directly before ""walm.""

So:

- If ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" -> output blue repeated.
- If ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" -> output green repeated.
- If ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" -> output red repeated.",-0.41067038094566033,67,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples between the input and the output. 

In the first input/output pair, ""walm"" seems to correlate with the repetition of the previous color. It appears after ""lug"" which is blue, and ""zup,"" which turns out to be yellow in the output.

In the second input/output set, ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" (blue) and causes repetition of the blue color in the output. 

In the third input/output pair, ""dax"" correlates with green in the output, and following ""dax walm,"" we get more green, indicating a repetition of the previous color.

In the fourth set, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (red) and followed by ""lug"" (blue). The output shows an extra red before turning to blue with ""lug.""

In the fifth set, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output is red again, reinforcing the idea of repetition.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color denoted by the word immediately before it in the sequence.

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

Using these associations, we can determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

1. When ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") follows ""wif"", the output is ""red blue"".
2. In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" (which translates to ""red""), and the output for these two is ""red red"".

- Whenever ""zup"" precedes any word, it translates to the color ""yellow"".
- The word following ""zup"" then determines the next color:
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
  - ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
  - ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the series of words before ""bluf"" in each input and the corresponding colors in the output. We can try to find any patterns or rules that apply consistently.

1. ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to the color red.

2. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green."" In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to the color green.

3. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows both ""dax"" and ""zup"" in different instances. After ""dax,"" it corresponds to green, and after ""zup,"" it corresponds to yellow.

4. ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to blue.

5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again and corresponds to red.

From the above, we can tentatively propose the following rules:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it corresponds to green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it corresponds to yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it corresponds to blue.

Let's call the word that precedes ""bluf"" the ""indicator."" Based on the examples, the color that corresponds to ""bluf"" seems to be the same as the color that corresponds to its indicator:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" after ""wif"" gives red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" after ""dax"" gives green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" after ""zup"" gives yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" after ""lug"" gives blue.

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value associated with the word immediately before it. To express this as a rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the immediately preceding word in the input sequence.",-0.09023592778954717,68,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we have to look at the patterns of the inputs and outputs to see how ""bluf"" affects the sequences of colors.

Reviewing the examples provided:

1. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
2. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
3. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
4. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In each example, the word ""bluf"" occurs at different positions, and after it, a sequence of colors appears. Notice that in all instances, the color after ""bluf"" repeats the color immediately preceding it:

1. ""lug wif bluf"" -> after ""wif"" which is ""red,"" the output is ""red.""
2. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> after ""dax"" which is ""green,"" the output is ""green.""
3. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> after first ""dax"" which is ""green,"" the output is ""green""; after second ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow.""
4. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> after ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" the output is ""blue.""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> after ""wif"" which is ""red,"" the output is ""red.""

Based on these patterns, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" is encountered in a sequence, the output color repeats the color that was translated from the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Thus:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Rule: bluf causes the next color in the output sequence to be a repetition of the color translated from the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""",-0.11996600025665088,68,bluf
"Observing the pattern in the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" may depend on the words that precede it. If we look at each instance of ""bluf"" and its preceding word, we can try to deduce a rule based on the outputs provided.

Let's examine the patterns:

1. In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif,"" and the output is ""blue red red.""
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax,"" and the output is ""red green yellow red green green.""
3. In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup dax"" and ""wif zup,"" giving the outputs ""yellow green green"" and ""red yellow yellow,"" respectively.
4. In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif lug,"" and the output is ""blue red blue blue.""
5. In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup lug zup walm dax wif,"" and the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""

Investigating these examples, we can attempt to extract corresponding pairs to figure out how ""bluf"" might affect the output:

1. ""lug wif bluf"" correlates to ""blue red red.""
2. ""wif dax bluf"" correlates to ""red green yellow red green green.""
3. ""dax bluf"" correlates to ""green green,"" based on ""zup dax bluf"" and removing the initial ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
4. ""wif zup bluf"" correlates to ""red yellow yellow,"" based on ""wif zup bluf"" and removing the initial ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
5. ""lug bluf"" correlates to ""blue blue,"" based on ""lug wif lug bluf"" and removing ""blue red"" for ""lug wif.""
6. ""dax wif bluf"" correlates to ""green red red,"" based on ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" and removing the preceding ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" for ""zup lug zup walm.""

From these observations, it seems ""bluf"" duplicates the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output includes ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output includes ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output includes ""green.""
- ""zup"" does not seem to influence ""bluf"" directly since no output directly follows ""yellow"" for ""bluf.""

So the inferred rule is that ""bluf"" denotes a duplication of the color of the word preceding it:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color word of the word immediately before it.",-0.43786797321424514,68,bluf
"From the given examples, we can observe a pattern in which the occurrence of the word ""bluf"" seems to be affecting the output colors. By examining what precedes ""bluf"", we can induce the logic applied.

- In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"". Here, the presence of ""bluf"" after ""wif"" results in the output ""red red"".
- In the second example, ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green"", which indicates that ""bluf"" following ""dax"" results in ""green green"".
- In the third example, ""zup dax bluf"" shows that ""bluf"" after ""dax"" still results in ""green green"". However, when ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"", we see the output ""yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue"", so ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in the output ""blue blue"".
- In the fifth example, there is a new word ""walm""; however, ""dax wif bluf"" still translates to ""yellow green red red"", signifying the translation of ""bluf"" in this context remains ""red red"".

Through these observations, we can establish a rule for ""bluf"": it echoes the color word that precedes it in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> The meaning is to repeat the output color that corresponds to the word just prior to ""bluf"", resulting in that color being said twice.",-0.8904090992601886,68,bluf
"Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the previous word, following the pattern where ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

There is an exception with ""zup"" where it does not matter what comes before the ""zup,"" as ""bluf"" will be ""yellow"" when following any number of consecutive ""zup.""

bluf -> The color that ""bluf"" translates to depends on the word right before it:
- If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
- If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- Regardless of the preceding word, if ""zup"" appears right before ""bluf,"" either directly or with other ""zup(s)"" in between, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""",-1.2014958609001887,68,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the input-output pairs provided and find a consistent pattern.

- Every time ""walm"" is present, it seems to generate a sequence of colors.

1. ""wif walm""
- Output: red red red
- Rule: ""walm"" following ""wif"" generates three reds.

2. ""dax walm wif dax""
- Output: green green green red green
- Rule: ""walm"" following ""dax"" generates three greens. When ""wif"" appears, it generates a red, but ""dax"" on its own translates to green.

3. ""dax walm zup lug dax""
- Output: green green green yellow blue green
- Rule: ""zup"" translates to yellow and ""lug"" to blue, but ""walm"" after ""dax"" still generates three greens.

4. ""dax lug walm""
- Output: green blue blue blue
- Rule: ""lug"" originally produces a blue, followed by ""walm,"" which seems to multiply ""lug"" by three after ""dax"".

5. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm""
- Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Rule: ""lug"" and ""zup"" following ""walm"" are each represented three times.

Analyzing the patterns, it appears ""walm"" triggers a repetition of three for the color associated with the word directly following it. If there is no word following ""walm,"" it inherits the color from the word that precedes it and repeats it three times. Using this rule, let's define the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next color-coded word to be repeated three times. If no color-coded word follows, it repeats the color preceding it three times.",-0.12085613307119573,68,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word in the output.

Explanation:

- In the first input ""wif walm"", the output is ""red red red"". Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" causes the color ""red"" to be repeated two more times.

- In the second input ""dax walm wif dax"", the output is ""green green green red green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and right after ""walm"", the color ""green"" is repeated twice before switching to ""red"" for ""wif"", then back to ""green"" for ""dax"".

- In the third input ""dax walm zup lug dax"", ""walm"" is again followed by two repetitions of ""green"", which is the color for ""dax"". The sequence then continues with ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"", ending with ""green"" for ""dax"".

- In the fourth input ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" is ""green"" followed by ""lug"", which is ""blue"". Then ""walm"" makes the color ""blue"" repeat three times.

- In the fifth input ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", ""dax"" starts with ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", followed by ""walm"", which repeats the color ""red"" three times, then ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", followed by another ""walm"" repeating the color ""yellow"" three times.

Therefore, ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated multiple times in the output.",-0.21594913094413049,68,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" represents a sequence of a particular color that is determined by the word immediately preceding it. Looking at the repeated patterns, we can deduce the following connections:

1. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red."" Therefore, ""wif walm"" seems to translate to a triple repetition of the color red.

2. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax walm"" is a triple repetition of green.

3. There is no instance of ""zup walm"" or ""lug walm"" alone to explicitly define what ""walm"" means after those words; however, in the last example, ""wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" gives three reds followed by the color that ""lug"" would be (blue), then by the color that ""zup"" would be (yellow). Therefore, ""zup walm"" and ""lug walm"" might imply a triple repetition of their respective colors following their patterns of ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

From this, we can deduce a rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of three of the same color that is determined by the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

So the rule is:

walm -> Represents a triplet of the color denoted by the preceding word.",-0.8234183584228264,68,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word walm produces a sequence of colors that are repeated based on the word that follows it. Here are the observations:

1. When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" we get ""red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" we get ""green green green.""
3. When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" we get ""blue blue blue.""
4. When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""

It seems that ""walm"" generates three repetitions of the color associated with the word that comes immediately after ""walm.""

Additionally, we can notice that other words are associated with single colors:
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

"Rule: 
By examining the sequences and the associated outputs, we can attempt to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green for ""dax"" and yellow for ""bluf.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow for both.
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red for both.

Based on the outputs following ""bluf,"" we can see that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word:

- ""bluf"" outputs yellow when it follows ""zup,"" which also outputs yellow.
- ""bluf"" outputs red when it follows ""wif,"" which also outputs red.
- ""bluf"" outputs green when it follows ""dax,"" which outputs green for that sequence.

Therefore, a possible rule could be that ""bluf"" represents a mimic or echo of the color associated with the previous word.

- In example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the word ""bluf"" following it causes another ""green"" to appear in the output.
- In example 2, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the word ""bluf"" following it leads to another ""red"" in the output.
- In example 3, the same as example 2 happens; ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and results in ""red red.""
- In example 4, ""wif"" is again followed by ""bluf,"" and the outcome is the same with ""red red"" being the output.
- In example 5, ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" also yields ""red red.""

With this pattern, the deduced rule is:

"Rule: ""bluf"" maps to the color output that is immediately before it in the input. If no color is present before it, then ""bluf"" takes the color that is output for ""wif"". Here are the observations:

- In Input 1, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green"", so ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"".
- In Input 2, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"", therefore ""bluf"" outputs ""red"".
- In Input 3, ""bluf"" has no preceding colors, but given the output for ""wif"" is ""red"", it follows the same output for ""bluf"".
- In Input 4, ""wif"" again precedes ""bluf"" and maps to ""red"", thus ""bluf"" outputs ""red"".
- In Input 5, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", and since ""wif"" maps to ""red"", ""bluf"" outputs ""red"".

1. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. dax wif walm -> green red red red
5. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue

Now, let's try to determine what role ""walm"" is playing:

- When ""wif"" is present, and ""walm"" follows it, the next three outputs are red (""wif walm"" -> red red red).
- When ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" the output is blue, corresponding to the output of ""lug"" itself (""lug walm"" -> blue blue).
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the output color following ""walm"" is repeated three times. For ""dax,"" it's green, and for ""zup,"" it's yellow.

Based on these observations, we can determine:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output of the next color to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the next color three times.",-0.11156141468025316,69,walm
"From the examples provided, we can infer a pattern that indicates what ""walm"" might mean. We can start by looking for consistencies in the outputs related to the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs.

In every output where ""walm"" is present, a sequence of three identical colors appears:

- Input: wif walm lug bluf | Output: red red red blue blue
- Input: zup wif walm           | Output: yellow red red red
- Input: dax lug walm         | Output: green blue blue blue
- Input: dax wif walm         | Output: green red red red
- Input: zup walm lug          | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

It seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color immediately preceding it three times. So, in each case, the color that appears before ""walm"" in the input is repeated thrice in the output.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times in the output.",-0.1212460703263291,69,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can examine the outputs associated with the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" and their related input patterns to deduce its meaning:

1. ""wif walm lug bluf"" results in ""red red red blue blue""
2. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red""
3. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red""
5. ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue""

Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

- Every time ""walm"" is present, there is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"".
- The number of repetitions is the same as the number of letters in the word that comes right before ""walm"".
  - For ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" has 3 letters, hence ""red"" is repeated three times.
  - For ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" has 3 letters, hence ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word, regardless of what that word is.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: Repeat the color of the word preceding ""walm"" as many times as there are letters in that word.

Thus, walm -> Repeat the preceding color based on the preceding word's length.",-0.13607188633392406,69,walm
"walm -> repeated color of the previous word.

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to cause the color of the previous word to be repeated multiple times, one less than the number of letters in the word that comes before ""walm"". Here's how the rule applies to each input:

- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""wif"" has three letters, so ""red"" is repeated three times before proceeding to ""lug"" which results in ""blue"" and then ""bluf"" which results in ""blue"" again.
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""wif"" has three letters, so ""red"" is repeated three times after ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""lug"" has three letters, so ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""dax"" which is ""green"".
- ""dax wif walm"" -> ""wif"" has three letters, so ""red"" is repeated three times after ""dax"" which is ""green"".
- ""zup walm lug"" -> ""zup"" has three letters, so ""yellow"" is repeated three times before going to ""lug"" which results in ""blue"".",-0.3618021485954429,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the context of the colors that are outputted.

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is red repeated three times (plus the color associated with the other word).
- When ""lug"" either precedes or follows ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times (plus the color associated with the other word).
- When ""dax"" and ""zup"" precede ""walm,"" the color associated with the word ""dax"" or ""zup"" is repeated three times (green for ""dax,"" yellow for ""zup""), followed by red if ""wif"" accompanies ""walm"" and blue if ""lug"" does.

Reviewing all examples, it seems that ""walm"" represents a triplet repetition of the color associated with the preceding word:
- If ""wif"" comes before, ""walm"" means red repeated three times.
- If ""lug"" comes before or after, ""walm"" means blue repeated three times.
- If ""dax"" comes before, ""walm"" means green repeated three times.
- If ""zup"" comes before, ""walm"" means yellow repeated three times.

If we consider that the color after ""walm"" also corresponds to a specific word, then the rule might be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, I would define ""walm"" as follows:

- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue red yellow red""

"Observing the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" echoes the colors of the words that precede it. Each word is associated with a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> blue

The output for ""bluf"" is the sequence of colors that represents the words immediately before it. It does not repeat colors for repeated words but acknowledges their sequence:

1. (zup bluf dax) yields ""yellow yellow green"" because ""zup"" is yellow, repeated twice, and ""dax"" is green.
2. (wif walm lug bluf) yields ""red red red blue blue"" because ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" is blue, and ""lug"" is blue, with ""wif"" occurring once yet displayed three times for emphasis possibly highlighting the importance of new or unique words in the sequence.
3. (lug dax bluf) yields ""blue green green"" because ""lug"" is blue and ""dax"" is green.
4. (lug walm wif bluf) yields ""blue blue blue red red"" because ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" is blue and ""wif"" is red, with 'new' words leading to extra emphasis in the output.
5. (zup lug zup lug zup bluf) yields ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"" because the pattern of ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue) is maintained and ""zup"" being new compared to the immediate word before bluf (lug) leads to two yellows.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it outputs a set of colors corresponding to the sequence of uniquely preceding words, with repeating words represented once and an emphasis pattern that highlights unique or new words in series by repeating their associated color(s).

Rule: bluf -> Outputs the sequence of colors associated with the words that came before it, with repeated words represented once and new or unique words emphasized.",-0.09919002955946513,70,bluf
"To inducing the rule, let's examine the relationship between each input word and its corresponding output color(s):

1. Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green
2. Input: wif walm lug bluf | Output: red red red blue blue
3. Input: lug dax bluf | Output: blue green green
4. Input: lug walm wif bluf | Output: blue blue blue red red
5. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf | Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Looking at this, it seems that each distinct word corresponds to a color (e.g., zup -> yellow, lug -> blue). Now analyzing the role of the word ""bluf"" in each sequence:

1. ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and ""dax,"" resulting in ""yellow green.""
2. ""bluf"" appears after ""wif walm lug,"" resulting in ""blue blue.""
3. ""bluf"" appears after ""lug dax,"" resulting in ""green.""
4. ""bluf"" appears after ""lug walm wif,"" resulting in ""red red.""
5. ""bluf"" appears after ""zup lug zup lug zup,"" resulting in ""yellow.""

Notice that the color(s) following ""bluf"" in the output always seem related to the words before ""bluf"" in the input. 

From these observations, we can induce a rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word directly preceding it in the input and repeats the color for as many times as the word has occurred in the input sequence before ""bluf."" Let's check this against the examples:

1. ""zup"" occurred once before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" results in one extra ""yellow.""
2. ""lug"" occurred once before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" results in two ""blue"" because ""lug"" naturally corresponds to ""blue.""
3. ""dax"" occurred once before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" results in one ""green.""
4. ""wif"" occurred once before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" results in two ""red,"" which matches the color output associated with ""wif.""
5. ""zup"" occurred three times before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" results in one additional ""yellow.""

Based on this rule induction, we get:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the directly preceding word as many times as that word appeared before ""bluf"" within the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence, since there are no examples provided for this case, the rule for its output is undefined based on current examples.",-0.15414482055580236,70,bluf
"Observing the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" triggers an output that is a repetition of the last color given before it, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of non-redundant words presented before ""bluf"" in the sequence.

Here are the breakdowns of each provided example:

1. ""zup bluf dax""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - There is no other non-redundant word before ""bluf""
   - Therefore, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (repeating the color that ""zup"" denotes).

2. ""wif walm lug bluf""
   - The unique non-redundant words before ""bluf"" are ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug,"" which result in ""red,"" ""red,"" ""blue.""
   - ""bluf"" then repeats the last color ""blue"" two times because there are two different words before it.

3. ""lug dax bluf""
   - ""lug"" and ""dax"" are unique and result in ""blue,"" ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" repeats ""green"" because ""dax"" is a single word before it.

4. ""lug walm wif bluf""
   - ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""wif"" are unique and produce ""blue,"" ""blue,"" ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" two times because ""walm"" and ""wif"" are the two different words before it.

5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf""
   - ""zup"" and ""lug"" alternate, but ""zup"" is repeated, so we consider ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""zup.""
   - They result in ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"" two times because the unique words before it are ""zup"" and ""lug"" (even though ""zup"" is repeated, there are still only two unique words ""zup"" and ""lug"").

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the last color mentioned before ""bluf,"" with the number of repetitions being equal to the number of unique non-redundant words precede ""bluf"" in the input sequence. If only one unique word precedes ""bluf,"" repeat the last color once.",-0.38658381915918616,70,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" means repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. 

Analysis: Each time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output color is the same as the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf"".

- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""bluf"" we see yellow.
- In ""wif walm lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""bluf"" we see blue twice.
- In ""lug dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""bluf"" we see green.
- In ""lug walm wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""bluf"" we see red twice.
- In ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", the last word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, and after ""bluf"" we see yellow.

Based on this pattern, ""bluf"" leads to a duplication of the output associated with the word before it. However, it seems that the amount of duplication is dependent on whether this word has appeared in sequence earlier. In cases where the same input word has not been repeated, ""bluf"" results in a single repetition of the color. When the same input word has been repeated, then ""bluf"" results in repeating the color for as many occurrences that have been seen earlier in the sequence.

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif

5. Input: zup walm lug

In each output, the appearance of the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""yellow"" colors. In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by three yellows, whereas in example 2, without ""lug"", it is followed by only two yellows, suggesting that ""lug"" potentially influences the number of times ""yellow"" repeats.

Additionally, in example 4, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" where the first ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in two extra ""blue"" before ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax."" This suggests that the presence of ""lug"" may affect the number of repetitions for the color that follows.

By comparing example 3 and example 5, we can see that ""zup walm lug"" results in three yellows followed by a blue, similar to how ""zup dax walm lug wif"" results in a yellow followed by two greens (from ""dax"") and then blue red (from ""lug wif""). This further indicates that ""walm"" might be generating additional instances of the color that would normally follow it (based on the word immediately after ""walm""), until a different color (caused by a different word like ""lug"") interrupts the sequence.

Therefore, given the evidence, a possible rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence until that color sequence is interrupted by a different color-inducing word.

So, based on the rule induction from the examples:

walm -> Repeat the next color until a different color is signaled by another word.",-0.07681290428527553,70,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can determine that the word ""walm"" has an impact on the colors that follow it. Let's break down the examples to analyze the pattern:

1. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"".
- The colors for ""lug"", ""wif"", and ""dax"" are blue, red, and green, respectively.
- After ""walm"", the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

2. ""wif dax zup walm"" results in ""red green yellow yellow yellow"".
- The colors for ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""zup"" are red, green, and yellow, respectively.
- Again, after ""walm"", the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

3. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow green green green blue red"".
- The color for ""zup"" is yellow, and ""dax"" is initially green, but after ""walm"", it remains green.
- ""lug"" is also associated with the blue color, and ""wif"" with red, after the word ""walm"".

4. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" results in ""blue blue blue green red blue red"".
- ""lug"" is associated with blue both times before and after ""walm"".
- The word ""walm"" appears before ""dax"" and ""wif"". Following ""dax"" and ""wif"" after ""walm"", they are blue instead of their usual green and red.

5. ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue"".
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the yellow, and then ""lug"" which is blue.

Considering these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next word to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for as many times as the word ""walm"" has been said. If ""walm"" has been mentioned only once, the next color repeats once.

Rule: walm -> causes the next word to repeat the color of the preceding word (for as many times as the word ""walm"" is mentioned).",-0.08038564851673467,70,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, we can notice a pattern relative to the word 'walm' and the resultant output colors.

1. In each instance where 'walm' appears, it is followed by at least one instance of 'yellow' in the output. 
2. The number of 'yellow' outputs following 'walm' seems to depend on the position of 'walm' and the words surrounding it. 
3. When 'walm' is preceded by 'zup', the next three outputs are 'yellow.'
4. When 'walm' is preceded by 'lug', the next two outputs are 'yellow.' 
5. When 'walm' comes after 'dax' or is the second word in the sequence, the following two outputs are 'yellow.'
6. It does not seem to have its own color associated with it, but rather, it modifies the next color outputs based on its position.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule for 'walm':

Rule: When walm occurs in a sequence, the subsequent color outputs are 'yellow.' The number of 'yellow' outputs is determined by its position and the word(s) preceding it, typically resulting in multiple consecutive 'yellow' outputs.

Thus, given this information:
walm -> meaning. The presence of 'walm' indicates a repetition of 'yellow' in the output, with the repetition count being influenced by its context within the word sequence.",-1.2748362331204084,70,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" affects the color output immediately following its occurrence. When ""walm"" appears, the output color is repeated three times in a row. For instance, in the first example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and in the second example, ""zup walm"" once again leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" In contrast, when a color word appears without ""walm"" before it, the color is only mentioned once in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that whenever ""walm"" precedes a color, that color is outputted three times consecutively.

- In ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" indicating ""bluf"" means ""yellow yellow"" in this context.
- In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" indicating ""bluf"" means ""red red"" when following ""wif.""

4. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""

Now let's look for a pattern. By comparing inputs with outputs, we can assume:

- ""wif"" always maps to ""red"".
- ""zup"" (in examples 2, 3, and 4) always maps to ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" (in examples 2 and 3) seems to map to ""red"", but it's repeated in inputs 2 and 3 while the output is just one ""red"", this could mean that ""wif"" and ""bluf"" might both correspond to ""red"", or ""bluf"" might be ignored when occurring after ""wif"".
- ""lug"" (in example 5) maps to ""blue"".

The most consistent observation is that ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Without further context, it is not completely clear how ""bluf"" fits into this, as it could either mean ""red"" itself, or it could be that it simply repeats the previous color when following ""wif"".

- In example one, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue"".
- In example two, even without a corresponding ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" again results in a ""yellow"" output just after ""zup"" does. However, since the only instance that ""zup"" led to a ""blue"" result was when followed by ""bluf,"" we cannot confidently conclude that ""bluf"" means yellow here.
- In example three, ""bluf"" is associated with two sequential ""blue"" in the output.
- In example four, ""bluf"" is again followed by the output ""red,"" but ""wif"" also directly corresponds to ""red"" in previous examples.
- Finally, in example five, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" once and then to ""yellow"" at the end.

Given these contexts, it seems that ""bluf"" on its own isn't consistently associated with a single color. Rather, the output color following ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes right before ""bluf"". Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.

Let's validate this against each example:

- In example one: Prior to the first ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which is blue, and before the second ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which is yellow. Correctly fits the rule.
- In example two: ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, fitting the rule.
- In example three: Both instances of ""bluf"" follow a word that is translated as blue, which is correct according to the rule.
- In example four: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to yellow and red, respectively, fitting the rule.

Explanation:
- In the first and fifth examples, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm lug"" leads to ""green green green blue,"" which indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times, followed by the ""lug"" color, which is blue.

- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm lug"" leads to ""yellow red red red blue,"" confirming that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and that ""walm"" follows the pattern of repeating the color that comes before it three times, in this case, red for ""wif,"" followed by blue for ""lug.""",-0.5078807300661902,72,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that follows the word ""lug."" Furthermore, there is a distinct relationship between other words and specific colors:

- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue (""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"").
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green (""dax walm lug"" produces ""green green green blue"").
- ""wif"" is associated with the color red (""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" produces a pattern where ""red"" appears thrice before ""walm"").
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow (it appears before ""yellow"" in the sequence).

So, given the consistent triple repetition of colors following the presence of ""walm"" after any color-associated word, the rule can be inferred as follows:

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm → Output: yellow yellow red red red

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correspond to a specific color. To determine the rule for what ""wif"" means, let's analyze the patterns.

In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" when positioned after ""lug"" and before ""dax"". Here's the relationship:

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red

In the second example, the order of ""dax"" and ""wif"" is reversed, and so is the order of the colors in the output. This suggests that the order of words may directly map to the order of the colors:

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green

In the third and fourth examples, we have ""wif"" appearing multiple times with its corresponding color output, ""red"":

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again:

Input: zup bluf wif walm

Given that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence, we can deduce the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, we can see that the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red."" Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- For the first input ""dax lug wif,"" the output is ""green blue red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to the last color ""red.""
- In the second input ""wif lug dax,"" ""wif"" is now the first word and corresponds to ""red,"" manifesting as the first color in the output.
- The third input ""lug walm wif zup wif"" has two instances of ""wif,"" and each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- The fourth input ""zup wif walm lug"" has ""wif"" after ""zup,"" and in the output, we see ""red"" appearing after ""yellow,"" which is the translation of ""zup.""
- Lastly, in the input ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" is positioned before the second ""walm,"" and the corresponding output has ""red"" in the same position before the second ""red,"" which represents ""walm.""

"To infer the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will compare the input phrases with their associated outputs, looking for a pattern related to the placement and repetition of the word ""bluf.""

1. In the phrase ""dax bluf wif lug,"" the output is ""green green red blue."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is mentioned twice. However, when ""bluf"" comes before ""wif"" and ""lug,"" the colors ""red"" and ""blue"" appear, respectively.

2. In ""dax bluf lug wif,"" we have the output ""green green blue red."" Compared to the first example, the word ""bluf"" is still between ""dax"" and ""lug,"" but the order of ""lug"" and ""wif"" is reversed, and so is the order of ""blue"" and ""red.""

3. For ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue green green."" The word ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" and it then repeats. In response, the colors ""blue"" and ""green"" are also repeated in the same order.

4. The phrase ""lug wif bluf"" has the output ""blue red red."" Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and ""wif,"" leading to the color ""red"" being repeated.

5. With the phrase ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" After introducing a new word ""zup,"" it results twice in ""yellow,"" while ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""walm"" triples the output color ""blue.""

From the above patterns, we can infer that ""bluf"" might be a rule that depends on the word following it. When it's before ""wif,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red."" When ""bluf"" comes before ""lug,"" the result is ""blue."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""green"" appears, and when it precedes ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" appears again.

Given that ""bluf"" affects the output of the following word rather than itself, it seems that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat,"" indicating that the color associated with the next word is to be duplicated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color signified by the next word in the sequence.",-0.09480437070235292,73,bluf
"The nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"" and ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue"". When the order is switched in the next example to ""lug wif"", the output is ""blue red"" indicating that ""bluf"" consistently results in the color ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""lug bluf dax bluf"" results in ""blue blue green green"", again supporting the idea that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".
- The fourth example has ""lug wif bluf"" leading to ""blue red red"", with ""bluf"" being the last word and corresponding to the last color ""red"". However, given the consistency of previous examples, it seems likely that there may be a typo or inconsistency with the pattern here. Based on the other examples, ""bluf"" should still mean ""blue"".
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" is translated to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Each occurrence of ""wif"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the colors ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, further reinforcing the meaning of ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> blue",-0.22325829707670589,73,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. When ""bluf"" is used once, it yields a single ""blue"" in the output. When used repeatedly as in the third example ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" it appears twice, translating to ""blue blue.""

However, in the last example provided, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the output for ""bluf"" seems to be ""blue blue blue,"" which is three times. This suggests that ""bluf"" may multiply the color that precedes it, in this case, it takes ""lug"" (blue) and triples it.

To ensure consistency, let's revisit the examples with this new rule in mind:

1. ""dax bluf wif lug"" gives us ""green green red blue."" If ""bluf"" multiplies the preceding color, it should have been ""green green red blue blue blue"" (multiplying ""wif,"" which is red), but it is not. Therefore, this example does not support our multiplication rule.

2. ""dax bluf lug wif"" gives us ""green green blue red."" It could suggest that ""bluf"" turns the next word into ""blue,"" but it follows ""dax"" (green), not preceding ""lug"" (blue), so it doesn't fit this pattern either.

3. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" translates to ""blue blue green green."" This could be supportive of the multiplication theory since ""bluf"" follows the same color word ""lug"" (blue), it repeats blue once, and when it follows ""dax"" (green), it repeats green. So, this example is ambiguous.

4. ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" If ""bluf"" multiplies the preceding color, we would expect ""blue red red red,"" but this is not the case.

Given the conflict between examples, it's possible that there may be an error in one of the examples, or there is an additional rule that is not apparent from the given data. Therefore, the simplest explanation consistent across all examples, except for the last one, is that ""bluf"" simply translates to ""blue,"" irrespective of its position or repetition.

Rule: bluf -> blue.",-0.23574140224905887,73,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the provided examples to see the consistent patterns related to its output. It's clear that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is a sequence of colors. By examining the correlation between the placement of ""bluf"" and the resulting colors, we might infer a rule.

Looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is blue.
2. However, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red.
3. Similarly, when ""bluf"" precedes ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is blue, but when it precedes ""wif,"" its output is red.
4. The third example shows ""bluf"" following ""lug"" and preceding ""dax,"" both times yielding green.
5. The fifth example shows ""bluf"" preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" resulting in a sequence of three blues.

From these observations, a rule can be formed based on the position of ""bluf"" and the words around it. However, there's a bit of inconsistency since we see that ""bluf"" yields green when it follows ""lug"" in the third example, but in the first example and the fifth, it results in blue under what seems to be the same condition.

But if we look closely at the fifth example, where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" we see the output is not just blue but a sequence of three blues. This might imply that ""bluf"" reflects some amplification or repetition principle, situating the color related to ""lug"" more than once because it is between two words (""zup"" and ""lug"") that might indicate blue.

Based on these examples, it seems like the meaning of ""bluf"" interacts with the surrounding words to influence the output, but there isn't enough consistent data to establish a solid rule. If we have to define a tentative rule based on what we've seen, it might go like this:

bluf -> A word that results in a color, likely influenced by the surrounding words, and appears to involve repetition or amplification when adjacent to specific words (like ""zup"" before ""lug"").

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent and potentially involves repetition or amplification of the color related to the adjacent word, but additional examples are needed to define a more precise and consistent rule.",-1.1810256971482354,73,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and see if there is a pattern that emerges with the output:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and leads to the output ""blue.""

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and leads to an output of ""red.""

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here the first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is ""red,"" and the second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) leading to an output of ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and leads to an output of ""red.""

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Both occurrences of ""walm"" follow ""lug"" (blue) and result in the output ""blue.""

Given these examples, the pattern appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. So if the word before ""walm"" maps to ""red,"" then ""walm"" is also ""red."" If the word before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" then ""walm"" is also ""blue,"" and so forth.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.06355966811888347,73,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's examine the corresponding outputs for each input where ""walm"" appears.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

In this sequence, ""walm"" corresponds to a ""blue"" output.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Here, the ""walm"" immediately follows ""wif"" and corresponds to repeated ""red"" outputs.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

In this example, ""walm"" appears twice: once after ""wif"" resulting in repeated ""red"" outputs, and once following ""zup,"" which leads to repeated ""yellow"" outputs.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Similar to previous inputs, following ""wif,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the colors continue corresponding with the other words as previous patterns suggest.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" and the outputs are ""blue blue blue yellow,"" which then repeats the ""blue"" after ""lug."" After ""zup,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" again, but after ""walm,"" it again results in three ""blue"" outputs.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" results in repeated outputs of the color that precedes it. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the output is multiple ""blue""s. If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" the output is multiple ""red""s.

"Based on the examples provided, where each input is translated to a sequence of color names, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"". The rule appears to relate to the repetition of a particular color name in the output sequence.

Let's analyze each input and corresponding output example:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - After ""walm"" appears, ""blue"" is repeated twice before changing to ""yellow"" with ""zup"".

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - After ""walm"", the color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - After the first ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times. After the second ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - Here, the first ""walm"" leads to three instances of ""red"". 

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - ""Blue"" is repeated twice after the first ""walm"". After the second ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Based on the patterns observed in the outputs, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately following it to be repeated three times in the output.

"Each example contains a sequence of nonce words and their corresponding sequence of colors. Observing the patterns and mapping the colors to the words, we can deduce the following:

- 'zup' correlates to the color 'yellow'.
- 'dax' correlates to the color 'green'.
- 'lug' correlates to the color 'blue'.
- 'wif' correlates to the color 'red'.

Now, let's focus on the word 'walm':

1. In the first example, 'walm' is followed by 'zup', and both 'walm' and 'zup' output the color 'blue' and then 'yellow'. However, 'walm' outputs one additional 'blue' before transitioning.
2. In the second example, 'walm' comes after 'wif' which outputs 'red', and 'walm' continues to output 'red' three additional times.
3. In the third and fourth examples, 'walm' follows the same pattern as in the first example, outputting the repeated color before transitioning to the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence.
4. In the fifth example, 'walm' follows 'lug', and 'walm' continues the output of 'blue', increasing the count before transitioning to 'yellow' for 'zup'.

From these observations, we can derive the rule that 'walm' repeats the color of the preceding word (if there is one) an additional three times, with an exception occurring when 'zup' follows, in which case 'walm' repeats the color of the preceding word once, transitioning to 'yellow' as per 'zup'.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

""walm"" follows ""dax"" (and ""zup"" in the latter occurrence) with the corresponding output color being green (and blue, respectively), the same as ""dax"" (and ""lug"").

In the fifth example:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the corresponding output color for ""walm"" is red, the same as ""wif.""

- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" follows it. In the output, we see additional ""blue"" after the corresponding colors for ""lug.""

- In the fifth example, we find that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif,"" which is assigned ""red."" Then ""walm"" follows, which is also ""red.""

From this analysis, we can rule out that ""walm"" directly corresponds to a single color. However, there seems to be a consistent rule that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Whenever ""walm"" appears, it imitates the color associated with the previous word.

In the second example:
- ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"",
- ""dax"" is translated to ""green"", and
- ""bluf"", following ""dax"", is translated to ""green"".

In the third example:
- ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"",
- ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"",
- ""bluf"", following ""zup"", is translated to ""yellow"".

In the fourth example:
- ""dax"" is translated to ""green"",
- ""wif"" is translated to ""red"",
- ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"",
- ""bluf"", following ""zup"", is translated to ""yellow"",
- ""wif"" is translated to ""red"",
- ""walm"" doesn't have a consistent translation, but when it follows ""wif"", it is translated to ""red"".

In the fifth example:
- ""dax"" is translated to ""green"",
- ""bluf"", following ""dax"", is translated to ""green"".

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""bluf"":

"Rule: bluf -> the color word that immediately precedes it in the Output. 

For example:
- In the first Input ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"", the Output associated with ""bluf"" is the word that comes right before it, which in this case is ""blue"" and then ""red"" for the second occurrence of ""bluf"".
- In the second Input ""zup dax bluf"", the Output for ""bluf"" is ""green"" because it comes after ""dax"", which translates to ""green"".
- In the third Input ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", the Output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" because it follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the Output.
- In the fourth Input ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", the Output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" again since it comes after ""zup"".
- In the fifth Input ""dax bluf"", the Output for ""bluf"" is ""green"" since it follows ""dax"".

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to different colors depending on the context.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (Example 1: ""lug bluf""), the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" stands alone or appears at the end of a sequence (Example 2: ""zup dax bluf"", Example 5: ""dax bluf""), the output color is the same as the color that precedes it.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (Example 3: ""zup bluf""), the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (Example 4: ""wif bluf""), the output is two ""reds,"" indicating that the word ""bluf"" might double the preceding color.

The rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it copies the color of the word that precedes it, with a special case after ""wif"" where it doubles the preceding color, and possibly another special case after ""lug"" where it turns to ""blue"" regardless of the preceding color (as ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"").

Rule: bluf -> copies the color of the preceding word or has specific rules following certain words, e.g., after ""lug"" it is ""blue,"" and after ""wif"" it doubles the preceding color.",-1.2014223963597823,76,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color that the previous word represents.

Explanation: Based on the patterns, it appears that the word 'bluf' takes the meaning of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. For example:

- In the first example, the word before the first 'bluf' is 'dax,' which corresponds to the color 'green.' Therefore, the first 'bluf' means 'green.' The word before the second 'bluf' is 'lug,' which corresponds to the color 'blue,' so the second 'bluf' means 'blue.'

- Similarly, in the second example, the word before 'bluf' is 'dax,' which means green, so 'bluf' represents 'green.'

- Continuing this pattern, in the third and fourth examples, we can see 'bluf' consistently represents the color of the word before it.

So the final rule for 'bluf' in this context is that 'bluf' takes on the color meaning of the preceding word.",-1.4927519410673913,76,bluf
Rule: bluf -> same color as the preceding word.,-1.918120969375,76,bluf
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm"", we should look at the patterns in which it is used and the corresponding outputs.

1. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""
5. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""

By observing the patterns and outputs, we can attempt to determine what rules ""walm"" follows:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""walm"" follows a word, and the output after that word is a repetition of the color associated with that word.
	- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green""
	- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue""
	- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow""

- In example 2, ""walm"" is at the end after ""wif"", and the output for ""wif"" and ""walm"" is ""red red"". Since we already have seen that ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"", ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color of the previous word.

- In example 5, we see ""dax walm wif"" without ""zup"" at the end, and compared to example 1, the color sequence is the same for ""dax walm,"" but it ends with a single ""red"" for ""wif"" without a yellow, indicating that ""walm"" does not seem to affect the final word ""wif"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" looks like it repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it. If this rule is consistent, then ""walm"" essentially means ""repeat the color of the previous word.""

Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color of the previous word""",-0.10091392369481482,76,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding output colors:

1. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
5. dax walm wif -> green green green red

From these examples, we can identify a pattern for color outputs which correlate with the presence of the word ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" is paired with ""dax,"" the output colors are green followed by another green (Example 1, 4).
- When ""walm"" is paired with ""lug,"" the output colors are entirely blue (Example 3).
- When ""walm"" is at the end of an input after ""wif,"" the output color is red (Example 2).
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" but before ""wif,"" the output color preceding ""wif"" is green (Example 1, 5).

Considering the above observations, here's a possible rule for ""walm"":

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: When ""walm"" is present, repeat the output color of the word before ""walm."" The only exception seems to be when ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" in which case the output for ""wif"" is always red, independent of ""walm's"" rule.",-0.12342983132153085,76,walm
"From the examples given, one can induce the following:

- In the first and fifth examples, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red"", and ""dax walm wif zup"" has an additional ""yellow"" at the end. ""Zup"" is the only new word added, which corresponds to the color ""yellow"" at the end.

- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow red red red"". We know that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". The remaining colors ""yellow"" and ""red"" are used twice which means ""bluf"" and ""walm"" are represented by these colors. Given ""bluf"" appears only once in this set, it is not entirely clear what color it represents.

- The third example is ""lug walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" is likely to correspond to ""blue"" since it appears three times, and ""walm"" is present once.

- The fourth example, ""zup walm dax,"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green"". We know ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green"".

Given the information above, a clear pattern for ""walm"" cannot be decisively deduced. However, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" might repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. This hypothesis fits all provided examples:

1. ""dax walm wif"" - ""green"" from ""dax"" is repeated due to ""walm"" and then followed by ""red,"" which is ""wif.""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" - ""red"" from ""wif"" is repeated due to ""walm.""
3. ""lug walm"" - ""blue"" from ""lug"" is repeated due to ""walm.""
4. ""zup walm dax"" - ""yellow"" from ""zup"" is repeated due to ""walm"" before turning to ""green,"" which is ""dax.""

Given this hypothesis, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.27226744450222223,76,walm
"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it in the sequence. More specifically:

1. In ""dax walm wif zup"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats the color green three times.
2. In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.
3. In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.
4. In ""zup walm dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times.
5. In ""dax walm wif"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats the color green three times.

Thus, the rule seems to be: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that directly precedes it, repeating the color three times.

walm -> meaning. The repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, occurring three times.",-0.47099204505370373,76,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of color outputs related to each input word:

Looking at the various inputs and their corresponding outputs, here is what we can observe:

1. Whenever ""walm"" is included in the input, a sequence of the same color is produced in the output, until another known color word appears or the sequence ends.

2. That color is dependent on the immediately preceding word.

For instance:

- In ""dax walm wif zup,"" after ""dax,"" we have a sequence of green until ""wif,"" which indicates red, followed by ""zup,"" indicating yellow.

- In ""lug walm,"" we only have ""lug"" and then ""walm"" which results in a sequence of blue.

- In ""zup walm dax,"" ""zup"" produces yellow, and then ""walm"" continues that sequence until ""dax,"" which changes the color to green.

- In ""dax walm wif,"" after ""dax,"" we see green until ""wif"" changes it to red.

Hence, we can see that ""walm"" functions as a continuation of the color indicated by the immediately preceding word, up until a new color word or the end of the sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the examples given to us and identify the pattern or rules that apply.

1. Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax lug wif lug
Output: green blue red blue
- Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and we can see that ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- In this example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" but corresponds to the triple ""green,"" which seems off considering the previous patterns.

4. Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more, and ""zup"" follows the pattern by mapping to ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
- In this example, ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and this is consistent even when followed by a word that we haven't seen before (""bluf"").

Based on the examples provided, it seems like ""dax"" stands for the color ""green,"" but example 3 is inconsistent with this interpretation. There could be a rule associated with ""walm"" that repeats the color tied to the word that precedes it.

If we apply this supplementary rule to example 3, it becomes consistent because ""dax walm"" would mean ""green green green,"" lining up with the outputs for the other examples.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

Input: dax zup walm wif

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red

Input: dax lug wif

By looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can make several observations:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears at the end of the input sequence, ""red"" is always the last color in the output sequence. This suggests that ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red.""

2. The words before ""wif"" in the input sequence correspond to specific colors in the output sequence. For instance, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. The color ""red"" appears only once when ""wif"" is the single word following the nonce word in the input.

With these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

The rule for ""bluf"" can be determined by observing when ""bluf"" appears in the input and identifying the corresponding word in the output. 

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output for both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" is ""green."" However, in the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and they both correspond to ""green"" again. Similarly, in the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" for ""lug"" and then ""green"" for ""bluf"" and ""dax"".

Taking all examples into account, the pattern is that ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> green",-0.056686084856404494,77,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can determine that ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color output. Let's identify the pattern:

- When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

Now, let's look at the context of ""bluf"" in each example:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and outputs the same color as ""dax.""
2. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green yellow red green green."" The last ""bluf"" again follows ""dax"" and outputs the same color.
3. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" outputs ""blue blue green green."" Each ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the word preceding it.
4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" outputs ""red red blue yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs the same color as ""wif.""
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" outputs ""red blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and outputs the same color as ""zup.""

Considering these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color value of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> The color output of ""bluf"" is the same as the color output of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",-0.0857235514675618,77,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns and pair them with their outputs.

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
2. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
3. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
4. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
5. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow

From these examples, we can see that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Each instance of ""bluf"" follows a pattern:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and the output is ""green"" both times.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" and yields ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red.""
- However, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" but yields ""yellow,"" which seems inconsistent with the previous pattern.

If all occurrences followed the pattern where ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word before it, then in the fifth example, ""bluf"" would be ""yellow"" following ""zup"" as it does in examples 1-3 (dax -> green, lug -> blue, wif -> red), and that pattern holds. Initially, there was confusion because the last entry of the output was wrongly interpreted. The last word in the input does not necessarily correspond to the last word in the output when there are repeat colors since the outputs reflect the sequence of colors. So, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately before it.

Looking again at the fifth example, if we realize ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that comes before it, then the sequence red, blue, yellow, yellow makes sense as ""bluf"" would mirror ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" There's no inconsistency.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the previous word in the sequence.",-0.09557602102251686,77,bluf
"Given the examples, it looks like ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows the previous word's corresponding color in a predefined sequence. The sequence seems to be red -> green -> blue -> yellow, then looping back to red. Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. Input: ""wif dax bluf"" maps to ""red green green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. Following the sequence, the color after green is green again, which is why ""bluf"" maps to green in this case.

2. Input: ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" maps to ""red green yellow red green green""
- The sequence red -> green -> yellow is followed, and after retracing the input and colors prior to the second ""bluf"", it is found after the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is green. Therefore, ""bluf"" translates to green following the sequence.

3. Input: ""lug bluf dax bluf"" maps to ""blue blue green green""
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the sequence shows that the color after blue is green. However, ""bluf"" right after ""lug"" translates to blue, indicating that the word before ""bluf"" repeats its color. The next ""dax"" corresponds to green, and since ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it also becomes green. 

4. Input: ""wif bluf lug zup"" maps to ""red red blue yellow""
- ""wif"" again corresponds to red, and the ""bluf"" immediately after matches it, indicating that ""bluf"" copies the color before it. 

5. Input: ""wif lug zup bluf"" maps to ""red blue yellow yellow""
- Following the sequence until ""zup,"" which is yellow, we would expect ""bluf"" to be red. However, it maps to yellow, reinforcing the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color immediately before it.

Using the information from the examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it translates to the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color of the word immediately before it.",-0.11874930093944941,77,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems consistent with the color green in the outputs, but there is one exception in the last example where ""bluf"" corresponds with the output ""yellow."" Therefore, we may infer that ""bluf"" generally means green, but its meaning can change depending on the context or position in the sequence.

However, analyzing the examples for patterns, we can notice the following:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is always green.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red, unless ""dax"" is also present, in which case it defaults back to green.
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output in the provided examples is blue or green.
4. ""bluf"" at the end of a sequence after ""zup"" resulted in yellow, which is a unique case.

To identify a rule for ""bluf,"" we need to look at the other words and their respective outputs to ascertain the underlying pattern. If we break down each sentence:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" and the output is red for wif and green for dax and bluf, suggesting bluf could be taking the same output as dax.
- The second example is an extended version of the first, with an additional ""wif dax"" sequence that follows the same pattern.
- The third example has ""bluf"" after ""lug,"" and ""lug"" has the output blue. However, the ""bluf"" following ""dax"" continues to have the output green.
- The fourth example is more complicated, as ""wif"" leads to red, ""bluf"" also leads to red, followed by ""lug"" and ""zup,"" which correspond to blue and yellow.
- In the last example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and deviates from the previous pattern, resulting in yellow.

Given the inconsistencies, it is difficult to establish a definite rule for ""bluf"" without more examples or clearer patterns. It seems that ""bluf"" could take the color of the previous word in some instances, or result in a color linked with a specific sequence, as seen with ""dax"" and ""zup.""

Hence, the provisional rule we can formulate is:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent, often corresponding to the following:
- Green, when it directly follows ""dax""
- The same color as the previous word in other contexts, but there are exceptions that might depend on the word(s) that come before ""bluf"" or its position in the sequence.

It is important to note that this rule is based on limited data and further examples might alter or refine the understanding of the word ""bluf.""",-0.6736884493180899,77,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here is the rule I have deduced:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three times in the output. 

Let's verify this with the examples:

Example 1:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. The presence of ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

Example 2:
Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. The presence of ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times. Then the sequence continues normally with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times. Before ""dax walm,"" we see ""wif"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to red and blue, respectively, and are unaffected by ""walm.""

Example 4:
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Here, ""lug walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times. The rest of the sequence follows the color pattern for the corresponding words: ""zup lug"" translates to yellow blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red.

Example 5:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red. Due to ""walm"" coming right after ""wif,"" red is repeated three times. ""Dax,"" following afterward, translates to green.

Based on the rule observed:

walm -> Causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated three times.",-0.10112231521612797,77,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example:

- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" again to blue, producing ""green green green yellow blue.""
- In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, and the triple green follows ""dax,"" which precedes ""walm.""
- In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" the pattern of repetition follows for ""lug"" producing ""blue blue blue,"" and there is no repetition for ""zup"" and ""wif"" because ""walm"" doesn't follow those words.
- In ""wif walm dax,"" we see repetition for ""wif"" as ""red red red"" and 'dax"" is followed by green.

Therefore, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

- In ""wif lug dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""green"" is repeated three times after ""wif"" and ""lug"" are translated to their respective colors.
- In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""blue"" is repeated three times, followed by the translations of the subsequent words.
- In ""wif walm dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""red"" is repeated three times, followed by the color for ""dax"". 

So, walm -> replicate the color of the word before walm three times.",-0.4294597054315116,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look at the patterns of input and output to find a consistent rule that applies across all examples.

In each output, the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of three of the same color. The exact color that is being repeated appears to depend on the word that immediately precedes ""walm"":

1. ""lug walm"" = ""blue blue blue""
2. ""dax walm"" = ""green green green""
3. ""wif walm"" = ""red red red""

We can observe that ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red."" Therefore, it seems that whatever color the preceding word maps to is then repeated three times when followed by ""walm.""

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output of the color corresponding to that word to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repetition of the color mapped to the preceding word, repeated three times.",-1.1876689575073258,77,walm
"Based on the examples given, each input word appears to correspond to a specific output color, and the output color repeats for as many letters are in the input word. For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and has three letters, resulting in ""blue blue blue"". 

Notably, the number of colors in the output matches the number of letters in the word ""walm,"" which also has four letters. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to dictate that the color of the word it follows should be repeated four times. 

For example:
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue blue"" – here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" signifies repeating this color four times.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green green"" – ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is repeated four times because of ""walm"".

2. The word ""wif"" appears alone and still produces the output ""red"" (""wif"" -> ""red"").

3. In sequences where ""wif"" is followed by another nonce word like ""dax,"" ""wif"" holds onto its meaning (""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"").

5. Input: lug zup dax walm

  - Example 1: ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
  - Example 3: ""walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue"".
  - Example 4: ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"".

- Example 2 is slightly more complex; ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which in the output is ""green."" The pattern of repeating the previous color three times after ""walm"" still holds.
  - We see that ""wif zup walm"" in the input leads to ""red yellow yellow yellow"" in the output.

In the second example, ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue"", where ""lug"" appears twice, each time corresponding to ""blue"".

In the third example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green"", reinforcing that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

In the fourth example, we need to figure out which words correspond to which colors. ""Zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow.""

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears to correspond with ""green,"" as it is the word right before ""green"" in the output.
- ""Zup"" seems to correspond with ""yellow,"" as it matches the position in the input-output in the first and the fifth examples.
- ""Lug"" is likely ""blue,"" as it consistently appears before ""blue"" in the output.
- ""Walm"" seems a bit trickier, but by elimination and the third example, it seems to correspond with ""red.""

Now let's consider ""wif."" In the first input, it's followed by ""red"" in the output. In all instances across the examples, ""wif"" is consistently followed by ""red"" in the output.

By induction, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds directly to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This is consistent across all provided examples.

",-1.752115090794118,79,wif
"Based on the examples given, we can see a pattern:

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
- Other words seem to map to other specific colors consistently as well when considering these outputs in conjunction.

Here's the breakdown:

- Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green
  - ""lug"" maps to the color ""blue""
  - ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow""
  - ""bluf"" maps to the color ""yellow""
  - ""dax"" maps to the color ""green""

- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
  - ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow""
  - ""walm"" maps to the color ""yellow""

- Input: zup dax walm zup wif -> Output: yellow green green green yellow red
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" (both instances)
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
  - ""walm"" translates to ""green""
  - ""wif"" translates to ""red""

- Input: zup dax wif zup -> Output: yellow green red yellow
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" (both instances)
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
  - ""wif"" translates to ""red""

- Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
  - ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow""
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green""

From the given examples, we can determine that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" every time it appears, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-0.10390184404391663,79,zup
"Based on the given examples, we observe the following pattern:

1. ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green"".
2. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red"".
4. ""zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""yellow green red yellow"".
5. ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green"".

The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"". ""Bluf"" translates to ""yellow"", while ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". Therefore, the word ""walm"" must translate to ""green"", given that it appears in contexts where ""green"" is in the output — in Inputs 3 and 4 specifically, we can confirm this because it's surrounded by ""zup"" and ""dax"", which translation to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively. The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Examining ""zup"", it is clear that it always translates to ""yellow"", regardless of its position or the context of the sentence. Thus, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-0.1345846662792858,79,zup

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" produces an output that matches the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. 

Let's analyze the examples to confirm this:

1. ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""zup,"" corresponding to yellow.

2. ""zup dax bluf"" yields ""yellow green green."" Here, ""bluf"" again takes the color of the word before it, which is ""dax,"" corresponding to green.

3. ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" yields ""blue blue red blue blue yellow."" Each occurrence of ""bluf"" matches the color of the word immediately preceding it (""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red).

4. ""wif bluf lug"" yields ""red red blue."" ""Bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

5. ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" yields ""red blue blue red yellow."" ""Bluf"" matches the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color value of the word right before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.08089003517068293,79,bluf
"Rule:
- bluf -> the color that corresponds to the previously mentioned (nonce) word.

Explanation:
In the given examples, whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color of the nonce word that immediately precedes it.

- ""zup bluf"": zup corresponds to yellow, therefore bluf also corresponds to yellow.
- ""zup dax bluf"": zup corresponds to yellow, dax corresponds to green, bluf takes the color of dax which is the word just before it, so bluf corresponds to green.
- ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"": lug corresponds to blue, wif corresponds to red, zup corresponds to yellow. When bluf appears, it takes the color of the word just before it; the first bluf after lug is blue, the second bluf after wif is red, and there's no bluf after zup.
- ""wif bluf lug"": wif corresponds to red, bluf takes the color of wif which is red, lug corresponds to blue.
- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"": wif corresponds to red, lug corresponds to blue, and when bluf appears it takes the color of lug which is blue, then it is followed by wif red, and zup yellow.

Therefore, ""bluf"" is a kind of contextual chameleon that changes based on the preceding word.",-0.5170034564043903,79,bluf
"From the provided examples, it appears the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a rule that determines its color meaning based on the word that immediately precedes it:

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
3. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
4. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Therefore, ""bluf"" reflects the color associated with the word before it and is repeated if ""zup"" or ""dax"" precedes it. Rule:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup"" or ""dax,"" output the color twice. If ""lug"" or ""wif"" precedes it, output the color once.",-0.8311385732379268,79,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be closely related to the word preceding it. When a word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is the color associated with that preceding word repeated twice. Here is the breakdown of each instance:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""

With this in mind, we can deduce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word twice.",-0.8811851603128052,79,bluf
"Reviewing all the examples provided, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that comes before it. Let's look at how ""bluf"" behaves after each different word:

- After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- After ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. If no color is associated or if ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence, more examples would be needed to determine its meaning.

So the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.8984657496756095,79,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat its color output for the sequence that follows until a different color word is said. 

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Explanation: After ""walm"" is said, ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"" is repeated until ""dax"" (green) appears.

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Explanation: The last color before ""walm"" is ""red"" (corresponding to ""wif""), which repeats.

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Explanation: ""Red"" (from ""wif"") is repeated after ""walm"" until a new color word, ""lug"" for blue, is said.

4. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   Explanation: ""Green"" (from ""dax"") is repeated after ""walm"" until a new color word appears.

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Explanation: ""Blue"" (from ""lug"") is repeated after ""walm"" until ""zup"" (yellow) occurs.

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to repeat its output until a new color word is encountered.",-0.06408153528340566,79,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to affect the color following it, by repeating the same color. Examining the given input and outputs:

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Explanation: ""dax"" means green and after ""walm"" it is repeated as ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
Explanation: ""wif"" means red and after ""walm"" it is repeated as ""red red red"".

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Explanation: ""wif"" means red and after ""walm"" it is repeated as ""red red red"".

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
Explanation: ""wif"" means red, but ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" here and ""green"" is repeated instead.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Explanation: ""lug"" means blue, and after ""walm"" ""blue"" is repeated as ""blue blue"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the color word that follows it to repeat based on the number of syllables in that following color word. However, the last example does not precisely fit this rule (as ""zup"" does not repeat). But considering the majority of presented evidence, this might be an oversight.

Rule: walm -> causes the following color word to repeat based on the number of syllables in the color word. If the color word has one syllable, repeat the color word once, and if it is two syllables, repeat the color twice.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. To articulate the rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

Below are the examples with annotations showing the implementation of this rule:

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow (because of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"") yellow (because of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"") green red red

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green (because of ""dax"" which is ""green"") green (because of ""dax"" which is ""green"") red green

Input: dax lug walm zup wif

In each case, the appearance of ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color of the word that comes right before it.",-0.2467241674607406,79,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat its output color. We can deduce this because whenever ""walm"" is followed by a particular word, the color associated with that word appears an additional time in the output sequence. 

For instance:
- In the first example, ""walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow."" 
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by no word and thus only repeats the color red (associated with ""wif"") three times.
- In the third example, ""walm lug"" results in ""red red blue,"" with ""red"" being repeated once for ""walm"" and ""blue"" following for ""lug.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm wif"" leads to ""green green,"" doubling the color associated with ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue,"" with ""blue"" being the color for ""lug,"" doubled because of ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
walm -> Repeat the color of the following word (if there is one; otherwise, repeat the last color mentioned).

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is encountered, the color of the following word is repeated in the output sequence. If ""walm"" is the last word, repeat the color of the last word before ""walm.""",-1.424799613147547,79,walm
"Observing the provided inputs and corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. Each instance where ""walm"" appears, it translates to ""red"" in the output sequence.
2. However, it seems ""walm"" also has an effect on the words immediately preceding it:
  - If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue"" for both ""lug"" and ""walm.""
  - If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the output color is ""red"" for both ""wif"" and ""walm.""
  - If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the output color is ""green"" for both ""dax"" and ""walm.""
3. The color immediately following ""walm"" stays consistent with ""walm's"" color instead of adhering to its usual mapping (except when the following color is ""bluf,"" which results in ""red"" - the color for ""bluf"").

From the patterns observed, we can infer that ""walm"" changes its meaning based on the preceding word by carrying the color assigned to the word before it and also impacting the color representation of the words to its immediate right, with the exception of ""bluf,"" which retains its mapping as ""red.""

1. The output seems to consist of colors, specifically ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red.""
2. ""Lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
3. ""Wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
4. The word ""dax"" seems to be a condition-dependent word as its output varies. When ""dax"" is before ""lug,"" it translates to ""green."" However, when it is before ""wif,"" it still translates to ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" itself may directly translate to ""green,"" irrespective of the word that follows, but there could be additional context we’re not seeing.

For example:
- In ""dax lug,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""green blue.""
- In ""dax wif,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""green red.""

5. ""Walm"" appears to translate to ""blue"" when it precedes ""dax"" or is alone, but when it follows ""dax,"" it seems to maintain the ""green"" coloring of ""dax"" before it.

Given the evidence, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Applying this rule, we get:
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue green red blue red""
- ""lug dax lug wif"" -> ""blue green blue red""
- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green red red green"" (note there was no example including ""bluf,"" so this element remains unaddressed)

The rule for ""walm"" is less clear, but the last example suggests that ""walm"" after ""dax"" could inherit the ""green"" color from ""dax."" However, this pattern is not consistent across all examples. Additional data would be required to refine the rule for ""walm.""
- ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green red red red""

In conclusion, the rule for ""dax"" is that it translates to ""green"" consistently. The behavior of ""walm"" requires further examination but ""dax"" itself appears to be:

However, the general pattern suggests ""dax"" translates to ""green."" When ""dax"" is used in any other context, e.g., before ""lug"" or ""walm"" or standing alone, it translates to ""green.""

1. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
2. ""wif"" itself does not seem to directly influence the color output of the following words, as they have their specific color associations observable in multiple examples (""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, etc.).
3. The presence of ""wif"" does not change the pattern of color outputs for other words present in the input string (based on the sequence they follow).

Here is the deduction from the available examples:

- In the input ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the word ""wif"" corresponds to the very first ""red"" in the output.
- In the input ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" the ""wif"" appearances correspond to the first ""red"" and then another ""red"" later in the sequence, without altering the expected pattern of colors for ""walm,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup.""
- In the inputs ""dax bluf wif"" and ""wif dax wif,"" only a single ""wif"" is present after other words. In each case, the appearance of ""wif"" results in a ""red"" in the output sequence in the position corresponding to where ""wif"" appeared in the input.
- The input ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" has ""wif"" appearing twice, and in both cases, a ""red"" appears in the output.

"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output examples. We will look for correlations between each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs and the corresponding segments in the outputs.

In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax  
   Output: red red yellow red blue green

Considering the examples above, it appears that ""bluf"" represents the second instance of the color word that appears before it in each input.

"From the provided examples, I will look for patterns that will help me induce the rule governing the meaning of ""bluf"".

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red."" The word ""bluf"" results in ""red.""

- In the second example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow green."" The word ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red green green red blue."" The word ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
  
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red red yellow red blue green."" Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on the examples, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" changes in each instance. However, by examining the patterns more closely, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word that immediately precedes it:

- In the first example, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" comes before the first occurrence of ""bluf"" and ""zup"" before the second; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" means ""blue"" in its first occurrence and ""yellow"" in its second.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" means ""red.""

By examining these patterns, a rule can be deduced:

Rule: ""bluf"" has the meaning of the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.",-0.09290872144971715,80,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's look at the output for every instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs:

- In the first input ""zup wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- In the second input ""lug zup bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third input ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth input ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif,"" the first instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" and the second to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth input ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Given that ""bluf"" maps to different colors in different contexts, let's look for patterns for each instance of ""bluf"":

- Bluf corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
- Bluf corresponds to ""yellow"" when it directly follows ""zup"" or is the word before ""dax.""
- Bluf corresponds to ""blue"" when it directly follows ""lug.""
- Bluf corresponds to ""green"" when it is followed by ""wif"" which is then followed by ""lug.""

Based on these observations, we can surmise that ""bluf"" takes on the color value based on the words around it. It seems that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

So, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

Bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf.""

- If ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- If ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- If ""lug"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" is before ""dax,"" it also means ""yellow"" (as in the second example), but there is not enough information to deduce a consistent rule for this scenario.

Now, let's assess the contexts in which 'walm' appears and its resultant outputs:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Since 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and the output is 'red red red', 'walm' in this context appears to result in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, 'wif'.

2. Input: dax lug dax lug walm

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf

   Here 'dax' is followed by 'walm' which resulted in two additional greens, and 'wif' is followed by 'bluf' (a word not defined in the outputs) but represented as red. So it would seem 'walm' is again a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

4. Input: zup walm wif

- Again, ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" translates into three yellows.
- ""lug"" results in one blue.
- Another ""zup"" without ""walm"" leads to one yellow.
- The sequence finishes with ""wif"" producing one red, and ""dax"" resulting in one green.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let us look at the examples where ""bluf"" appears and what outputs are associated with it. 

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears twice:
   - Both times it is followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""blue.""
   - This might suggest ""bluf"" could mean ""blue,"" but let's check other examples to confirm.

2. In the second example:
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" twice and the output is ""red red green.""
   - Without additional context, this may seem confusing. However, if ""bluf"" means ""red,"" then the outputs align with the introduction of ""walm"" shifting the color to green.

3. In the third example:
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""red,"" supporting the idea that ""bluf"" means ""red.""

4. In the fourth example:
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" resulting in ""green red,"" which again aligns with ""bluf"" meaning ""red"" and the color shifting with the introduction of a new word.
   - ""bluf"" is then followed by ""lug,"" which normally outputs ""blue,"" but here we see ""yellow,"" which is the output for ""zup."" This might indicate that ""bluf"" could repeat the previous color.

5. In the fifth example:
   - ""bluf"" comes after three ""blue"" outputs and results in ""red red.""
   - If ""bluf"" meant ""blue,"" we would expect just one ""blue"" output, but the repetition suggests that ""bluf"" might be altering the pattern.

After reviewing the examples, a pattern starts to emerge: ""bluf"" seems to be acting as a modifier that changes the usual output color of the following word. Instead of giving a specific color, ""bluf"" appears to change or repeat the previous color sequence based on what follows it.

Looking at the consistency across all examples for the word that follows ""bluf,"" the rule is not straightforwardly about repeating a color but more likely about modifying the subsequent word's color output based on what was previously mentioned.

With this in mind, let's propose a rule:

Rule: ""bluf,"" when followed by a word, modifies the expected output of that word's color either by repeating the previous sequence or altering it, but the specific rules governing this are not clear from the given data.

Thus:

bluf -> meaning: A modifier word that changes the output of the color sequence, the exact mechanism of which cannot be determined from the provided examples.",-1.1376378219965688,82,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

The rule is determined based on the instances where the word ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding color that is outputted. In every case, when ""bluf"" is in the input, ""red"" is in the output, suggesting that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".",-1.7181323607607843,82,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Explanation: In all examples, the appearance of the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. There is no variation depending on context or position, which indicates that ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""red"" irrespective of its placement within the sequence.",-1.7237092134002943,82,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" maps to the color ""red"".",-1.8772217011418622,82,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each example and its associated output:

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
5. dax walm lug -> green green green blue

From examples 1 and 4, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and in 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" 

In examples 2, 4, and 5, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In example 3, when ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is two reds. So, ""wif"" by itself might result in a single ""red,"" but when paired with ""walm,"" it doubles the ""red."" We can't confirm this just yet, but let's keep observing.

Also, looking at examples 2 and 5, ""lug walm"" and ""dax walm lug"" both end with ""blue,"" but ""lug"" is always blue. This suggests ""lug"" controls the color ""blue,"" while ""walm"" does not influence it, since it remains constant.

Now let's analyze ""dax."" In example 3, ""dax wif"" results in ""green red,"" and in example 5, ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue."" It seems that ""dax"" might be associated with the color ""green,"" as in both instances, ""green"" is present in the output.

Based on these observations, we can try to infer the rule for ""walm"":

- It is clear that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color associated with it. 
- When following ""zup"" (example 1 and 4), ""walm"" generates more of the same color as suggested by ""zup,"" which is yellow, so we see ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When following ""lug"" (examples 2 and 5), ""walm"" also generates more of the color suggested by ""lug,"" which is blue, so we see ""blue blue blue.""
- Following ""dax"" (example 5), we get ""green green green,"" which is consistent with ""green"" being the color associated with ""dax.""

Therefore, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the previous word multiple times in the output. The exact number of repetitions may vary based on the preceding word, or potentially based on a rule not entirely decipherable from the given examples. However, we consistently see a multiplication effect wherever ""walm"" appears.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word multiple times in the output.",-0.08666093533963413,82,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern in each input relative to the output.

- Input: zup walm wif / Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- Input: lug walm / Output: blue blue blue
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm / Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup walm lug / Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- Input: dax walm lug / Output: green green green blue

Based on the outputs, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times. This repetition effect does not occur when ""walm"" is not present. For example, ""wif"" on its own translates to a single ""red,"" but when it follows ""walm,"" like in the first example, it is not repeated. Here's the observed pattern:

- ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" when followed by ""walm.""
- ""lug"" produces ""blue"" when followed by ""walm.""
- ""dax"" produces ""green"" when followed by ""walm.""
- ""wif"" only produces ""red,"" which seems to be its inherent color without repetition.

Note that when ""wif"" is between repeated color words and ""lug,” it is red and not repeated, suggesting that its presence after ""walm"" does not replicate the color again - ""wif"" acts as a breaker. This is evident in the third provided example, where ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and results in a single ""red"" rather than repeating it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word that comes before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color word to be repeated three times.",-0.10013698395457321,82,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to correlate with the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm."" For example:

- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and after ""walm,"" we have three instances of yellow before the pattern changes with ""wif,"" which gives red.

- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and after ""walm,"" we have three instances of blue.

- In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, but since ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" we see three reds succeed it. Later, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to three yellows.

- In ""zup walm lug,"" again ""zup"" gives yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which results in three yellows before the pattern changes due to ""lug,"" which gives blue.

- In ""dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" correlates with green, and following ""walm,"" we have three greens before turning to blue with ""lug.""

Based on the observed pattern, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", where 'walm' repeats 'lug's color thrice since 'lug' has one syllable. 
- In the sequence ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", 'walm' first repeats the color of 'wif' (red) three times because 'wif' has one syllable, and then repeats the color of 'zup' (yellow) three times for the same reason.
- ""zup walm lug"" shows that after 'zup' (yellow), 'walm' continues the yellow sequence three times before 'lug' changes the color to blue.
- ""dax walm lug"" shows that after 'dax' (green), 'walm' results in three more greens before 'lug' changes it to blue.",-0.4242425758768295,82,walm
"Based on the presented examples, let's analyze the outputs correlated with the input that includes the nonce word ""walm.""

- In every instance where ""walm"" is used, a sequence of three identical colors is outputted just before any color that might follow.
- The color that precedes the sequence of three identical colors is not consistent throughout the examples, so ""walm"" does not correlate to a specific initial color.
- The instances ""lug walm"" and ""walm lug"" both resulted in a three-color sequence followed by blue, suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, while ""walm"" resulted in the triad sequence.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the outcome is three yellows followed by another color if another word follows ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the outcome is three greens followed by another color if another word follows ""walm.""

Combining these observations suggests that the rule for ""walm"" may be that it causes the next word's corresponding color to be outputted three times in a row. If ""walm"" is the last word, it results in a triad of the last color outputted before it.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of certain colors. The rule is consistent regardless of the preceding word.

Let's examine the evidence:

1. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" follows a ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it's at the end of the sequence, hence the double ""yellow.""

2. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and it's the last word in the sequence, resulting in a double ""red.""

3. ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""bluf"" is not doubled, it appears once.

4. ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green."" For this line, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and it is not the last in the sequence or followed by another ""bluf,"" so it only translates to a single ""green.""

5. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""green green yellow yellow green."" In this example, the first ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green"" and is followed by ""zup"" rather than another ""bluf,"" so it appears once. The second ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"" and is followed by ""dax,"" so it also appears once.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is followed by another ""bluf"" or it is the last word in the sequence, it is repeated twice.",-0.07666607000900512,84,bluf

"Analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, one can deduce the following pattern:

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
4. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""

From these examples, we can notice that the occurrence of the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example:

- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output repeats ""yellow"" for ""walm"".
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", and the output repeats ""green"" for each instance of ""walm"".
- In the third and fourth inputs, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", and the output repeats ""blue"" for ""walm"".
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output repeats ""yellow"" for ""walm"".

Based on this, we can conclude that:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word that precedes it.",-0.09807619853945157,84,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word that precedes it:

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" 
   - Here ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

2. ""dax walm"" turns into ""green green green.""
   - ""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" which is then repeated three times after ""walm.""

3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red.""
   - ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" which is then repeated three times after ""walm.""

4. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red.""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" After ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times, ignoring ""blue.""

5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" which is then repeated three times after ""walm"" before continuing the sequence.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes that color word to be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is sandwiched between two different color words, it causes the color word that follows it to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the following color word three times. If ""walm"" is between two different color words, repeat the color word that follows.",-0.10371054705125807,84,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems like the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the previously mentioned color. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color.

Now I will break down each example to support this rule:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   - zup = yellow, lug = blue, zup = yellow, walm = repeat the last color (yellow), dax = green, wif = (not sufficing enough data to conclude its color independently but seems to be leading towards red), bluf = red
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow (zup walm) green (dax) red red (wif bluf)

2. Input: dax walm
   - dax = green, walm = repeat the last color (green)
   Output: green green (dax walm)

3. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   - lug = blue, walm = repeat the last color (blue), wif = (appears red from previous example), bluf = red
   Output: blue blue (lug walm) blue (walm wif) red red (wif bluf)

4. Input: lug wif walm
   - lug = blue, wif = (seems to be red), walm = repeat the last color (red)
   Output: blue red red (wif walm)

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   - zup = yellow, walm = repeat the last color (yellow), lug = blue, wif = red (consistent with previous examples), bluf = red
   Output: yellow yellow (zup walm) yellow (walm lug) blue red red (wif bluf)

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color.",-0.22099150486758065,84,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to take on the color value of the previous non-""walm"" word. In other words, ""walm"" repeats the color that was just mentioned. Here is how that works out:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so ""walm"" becomes yellow. The pattern continues with every subsequent ""walm"" until the color changes with a new word that is not ""walm"" (in this case, ""wif"" which is red).
- In the second example, the only color given before ""walm"" is ""dax"" (green), so ""walm"" takes the green color twice.
- The third and fourth examples follow the same pattern, with ""walm"" taking on the color of ""lug"" (blue), until a new color word is present (""wif"" which is red).

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Takes the color value of the preceding non-""walm"" word. If ""walm"" is the first word or follows another ""walm,"" it retains the color value it has been given by the previous non-""walm"" word.",-1.1447306755086022,84,walm

- `lug`, `zup`, `bluf`, and `wif` correspond to `blue`, `yellow`, `yellow`, and `red` respectively.

3. ""zup wif walm"" → ""yellow red red red""
4. ""wif dax bluf"" → ""red green green""
5. ""wif"" → ""red""

In each of these examples, the presence of ""wif"" correlates with the word ""red"" appearing in the output. The position of ""wif"" in the input does not seem to affect its corresponding output:

- When ""wif"" appears at the start, as in example 4 and 5, ""red"" appears at the start of the output.
- When ""wif"" appears in the middle, as in examples 1 and 2, ""red"" appears right after the translation of the word before ""wif"".
- When ""wif"" appears at the end as in example 1, ""red"" is the last color in the output sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" In each case, the presence of ""walm"" after a color word causes the output to repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm."" We will examine each input and output closely:

1. Input: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" 
   Output: ""yellow green green green blue red""
   - Following ""dax"" (green), the color green is repeated twice, correlating with the occurrence of ""walm.""

2. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf""
   Output: ""red red red blue blue""
   - Following ""wif"" (red), the color red is repeated twice, indicating that the occurrence of ""walm"" might cause the previous color to repeat.

3. Input: ""lug walm""
   Output: ""blue blue blue""
   - Following ""lug"" (blue), the color blue is repeated twice.

4. Input: ""wif walm""

   - Following ""wif"" (red), the color red is repeated twice.

5. Input: ""lug walm""
   Output: ""blue blue blue""
   - Following ""lug"" (blue), the color blue is repeated twice.

Based on the above patterns, we can create the rule for ""walm"":

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" induces the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For example, in ""zup dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, so ""walm"" results in the repetition of green. Similarly, in ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" means the color red is repeated.

"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat the color associated with it. So if ""lug"" normally corresponds to the color blue, ""walm lug"" results in ""green green"". However, since we see that ""walm lug"" and ""lug walm"" consistently result in ""blue blue blue,"" not ""green green,"" there may be an error in the first example's output or an additional rule that has not been illustrated by these examples.

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that 'zup' corresponds to a particular color each time it's used. It's important to compare the occurrences of 'zup' with the rest of the words and their related colors to determine the rule for what 'zup' means.

Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red

The word 'zup' appears once and corresponds to 'yellow'. 'Bluf' also corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' translates to 'red', and 'walm' also seems to translate to 'red'.

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Here, 'zup' translates to 'yellow' each time, 'dax' translates to 'green', 'bluf' is still 'yellow', 'wif' is 'red', and 'lug' is 'blue'.

3. Input: zup dax zup wif -> Output: yellow green yellow red

In this example, each 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'dax' to 'green', and 'wif' to 'red'.

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow

In this sequence, 'dax' is again 'green', 'bluf' is 'green' which differs from the first example, 'wif' is 'red', and 'zup' at the end is 'yellow'.

5. Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue

'Zup' is 'yellow', 'dax' is 'green', and 'lug' is 'blue'.

Combining all observations, every instance of the word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow', regardless of its position or the words that surround it. The color associations for other words may vary, as seen with 'bluf', which is tied to 'yellow' in some instances and 'green' in others.

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'",-0.0627390360557872,86,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" precedes a color name. The pattern appears to be that the word following ""zup"" determines the color to be outputted before the sequence of colors continues normally. Here is the breakdown of what each word seems to represent in color:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax"" when preceded by ""zup"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""dax"" on its own corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

When ""zup"" appears before any color-denoting word, it seems to command the output of ""yellow"" before the color indicated by the following word is outputted.

Here is the deduced rule:

zup -> The word ""zup"" signals the output of the color yellow immediately before the color indicated by the subsequent word.

Rule: When ""zup"" is encountered, output ""yellow"" and then translate the next word into its corresponding color output.",-0.9978562142936164,86,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can notice the following pattern: Each time the word ""zup"" is used, the output is ""yellow."" When other nonce words are used, they correspond to different colors, but ""zup"" consistently correlates to yellow. Thus, we can deduce the rule for ""zup"" as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.6668257699542555,86,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word 'zup' is attached to a specific color output in the sequences given. In each case where 'zup' is mentioned, the output includes the color 'yellow'. Therefore, the rule appears to be that 'zup' correlates to the color 'yellow'.

1. ""zup"" appears to always precede a color word in the Output.
2. The color indicated by ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
3. In every Output where ""zup"" appears, the term ""yellow"" directly follows.

Therefore, from the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

Thus:

"Given the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for what ""bluf"" represents by examining the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here are the examples mapped side-by-side for analysis:

3. Input: wif bluf

4. Input: dax lug bluf

5. Input: wif bluf

In examples 3 and 5, the input ""wif bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red red"". This suggests that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" map to ""red"". To confirm this, we need to ensure there are no counterexamples. In examples 1, 2, and 4, every time ""bluf"" appears, the output color is ""red"". There is consistency here, as ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color ""red"".

Therefore, we can deduce that:

bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",-0.07086557761195002,86,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we first observe each input where ""bluf"" appears and look for patterns in the corresponding output:

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue
5. wif bluf -> red red

By examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can make some inferences:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" in examples 1, 2, 3, and 5, and the output is ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" with both outputs being ""blue.""

This consistency in output suggests that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color association like ""wif"" or ""dax"" but instead repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, if ""bluf"" follows a word that results in ""red,"" the output is ""red,"" and if it follows a word that results in ""blue,"" the output is ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.10795017506807503,86,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the following observations can be made:

1. In the first example ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Here, ""bluf"" is followed by a word not seen in the ""Output"" part (""zup"") and is followed by ""wif."" The output for ""bluf"" here is ""red.""

2. In the second example ""wif bluf dax walm,"" only ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""bluf,"" there is ""dax,"" which is already known to correspond to ""green."" Here, ""bluf"" has the output ""red.""

3. The third example ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" reinforcing the notion that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

4. The fourth example ""dax lug bluf"" provides different information. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the corresponding color is ""blue.""

5. The fifth example is identical to the third example, which reconfirms the same translation for ""wif bluf"" as ""red red.""

Given the above, we can deduce the following rule for ""bluf"": ""bluf"" takes the color immediately preceding it. If there is no color word before it, ""bluf"" defaults to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color immediately preceding it in the sequence, or defaults to ""red.""",-0.45797464875562477,86,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided, focusing particularly on the context in which the word ""bluf"" appears and what output it correlates to.

Here are the instances where ""bluf"" is mentioned, along with the corresponding output:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. dax bluf -> green red
3. wif dax wif bluf -> red green red red
4. wif bluf dax -> red red green

If we analyze the patterns where ""bluf"" appears, we notice the following:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" or is at the end of the sequence, and in both cases, it corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and it corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" and it corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on these instances, the most consistent pattern is that ""bluf"" correlates to the color ""red"" when it's either preceded by ""wif"" or not preceded by ""lug."" When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" regardless of the preceding words, it corresponds to ""blue."" There is no instance provided where ""bluf"" is followed by a word other than ""dax"" or ""wif,"" so we cannot determine from the given data whether the subsequent word has any effect on the output associated with ""bluf.""

Additionally, since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in most instances except when following ""lug,"" where it turns to ""blue,"" ""lug"" seems to be the modifier that changes the output of ""bluf.""

Given this, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: Generally, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" unless it immediately follows the word ""lug,"" in which case it corresponds to the color ""blue.""",-1.1495863479882498,86,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique input word corresponds to a unique output color. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the consistencies in the outputs where ""bluf"" appears in the input:

- In the first example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, similar to the other examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

However, there's an inconsistency in the fourth example where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" instead of ""red."" This inconsistency could suggest that there is another rule at play affecting the output, which might be dependent on the context or position in the sequence, or possibly affected by the words that surround it.

Being a rule induction system, an inconsistency in the data without additional context or rules provided leads to an inability to produce a definitive rule for the meaning of ""bluf."" However, since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in four out of five examples, and those four examples are consistent with each other, we can tentatively hypothesize that ""bluf"" usually means ""red,"" with an understanding that there may be exceptions or additional rules not yet uncovered that could explain the discrepancy in the fourth example.

"To deduce what ""dax"" means or the rule it follows, we need to analyze the patterns in the given examples. Let's break down each example:

1. In the sequence ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" This association appears consistent across all examples. 

2. ""wif"" always follows with ""red,"" while ""lug"" is always followed by ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

3. When ""dax"" is present, no matter the position, the first color output is ""green.""

4. The number of ""green"" outputs after ""dax"" seems to correspond with the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively after ""dax.""

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in the input sequence, the first output color is always ""green."" If ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output will be a series of ""green"" corresponding to the number of ""walm"" that follow ""dax"" directly.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" appears to consistently map to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. This association holds true regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence and independent of the surrounding words.

The other words, ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup,"" appear to map to other colors. ""Wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""walm"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow."" However, it is worth noting that the color ""yellow"" is repeated multiple times for multiple instances of the same word, which is the case for ""walm"" in the first example.

Given the information from each example:

- When ""dax"" appears alone, it outputs one instance of ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by a repeating word, as in ""dax walm,"" the output is multiple ""green,"" matching in number the count of words in the input including ""dax.""
- When ""dax"" follows other words, as in ""zup wif zup dax,"" it gives a single ""green"" following the pattern induced by the other words.

Therefore, the rule associated with ""dax"" appears to be that it is mapped to the color ""green"" every time it appears, and it outputs ""green"" just once for each occurrence of ""dax.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the correlation between the appearance of ""dax"" in the input and the resulting output colors. Let's examine the inputs and corresponding outputs provided in the examples.

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the immediate output is ""green.""
- The appearance of ""dax"" by itself or at the beginning of a phrase seems to set the output to ""green.""
- The output then changes colors sequentially after ""dax"" is mentioned, but this sequence is influenced by the words that follow ""dax.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output color is ""green"" repeated for each occurrence of ""walm.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output color is ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""
- When ""dax"" appears after ""zup"" and ""wif,"" which output ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, ""dax"" results in ""green"" again.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" could be:

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in the input, it resets the color sequence to ""green"" and does not depend on the position of ""dax"" in the input string; it will always output ""green"" for ""dax."" Subsequent words after ""dax"" may follow a different color pattern or rule that has not been clearly defined with the given examples.

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - There is a starting ""red,"" and then the colors correspond to ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" and ""walm"" (blue).

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and again there is an additional ""red"" at the end.

5. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   - There's an initial ""red"" and then ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

From the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to an additional fixed color when it's in the input. When ""wif"" comes after a word, it results in ""red."" When it comes before another word, the sequence starts with ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",-0.08561011415357653,87,wif
"To find the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the given input-output pairs to see what word or rule ""wif"" corresponds to:

1. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
   - Here ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" to blue, ""lug"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow.
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" when situated between ""dax"" and ""walm lug.""

2. lug wif -> blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Following this pattern, ""wif"" would correspond to red.

3. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" is at the beginning and corresponds with red, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" seems to be blue too.

4. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" is green in this string, ""wif"" corresponds to red again.

5. wif zup -> red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds with red, ""zup"" with yellow.

Given the examples, ""wif"" appears to consistently correspond to the color red, regardless of its position in the input string. Thus, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.0940631234960706,87,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the color patterns associated with other words and their positions related to ""wif.""

Examples with ""dax"":
- ""dax wif"" results in ""green red""
- ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue""
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" results in ""blue green yellow green green green red""

Examining when ""dax"" is present, it seems that ""dax"" before ""wif"" induces the color green for ""dax"" and red for ""wif."" But when ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the ""dax"" turns green and ""wif"" is still red.

Examples with ""lug"":
- ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red""
- ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue""
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" results in ""blue green yellow green green green red""

When ""lug"" is before ""wif,"" ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. When ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" then ""lug"" turns blue while ""wif"" is red regardless of its position.

Examples with ""walm"":
- ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue""
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" results in ""blue green yellow green green green red""

Whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" regardless of the number of words between them, ""walm"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red.

Examples with ""zup"":
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" results in ""blue green yellow green green green red""
- ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow""

""Zup"" induces yellow after ""wif,"" but when ""zup"" is after other words, it still remains yellow. 

Combining all these observations, it seems that irrespective of the other words, whenever ""wif"" is present, the color red always follows after it. Moreover, other words maintain consistent colors when appearing after ""wif"" (e.g., ""dax"" is always green and ""lug"" is always blue after ""wif""). Therefore, it seems that ""wif,"" when used in a sequence, is a marker for the color red, and it's possible that it sets a pattern for the subsequent colors of other words when used in combination, but as those rules are unclear, let's stick to what we can confirm.

Rule: ""wif"" -> red.",-0.4520261631801178,87,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" correlates to a color output.

Examining each example:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm lug zup,"" the output is ""red red red blue yellow."" ""Walm"" and ""lug"" both result in ""blue"" in other contexts, but here they are both producing ""red."" ""Zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" regardless of the presence of ""wif.""
- When ""wif"" occurs alone with ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue,"" where ""lug"" by itself elsewhere also produces ""blue.""
- With ""wif dax lug walm,"" the output is ""red green blue blue blue."" The presence of ""wif"" at the beginning turns ""dax"" to ""green"" (although it is usually ""green"") and ""lug walm"" to ""blue"" each.
- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" only the final ""wif"" changes the color of ""walm"" from ""blue"" to ""red""; ""dax"" remains ""green"" and ""lug"" remains ""blue.""
- Finally, ""wif zup"" yields ""red yellow,"" where ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can determine that when ""wif"" appears in an input sequence, it changes the following word's color to ""red,"" except for ""zup,"" which remains ""yellow."" So, ""wif"" turns the color of the subsequent object to red if it is another word.

Rule: wif -> changes the following word's associated color to red, except for ""zup"" which remains yellow.",-0.4934693443612352,87,wif
"To deduce the meaning of 'wif', we need to analyze the patterns between the inputs and the corresponding outputs. Here’s the breakdown of each example:

In the first example:
- dax converts to green
- wif converts to red
- walm converts to red
- lug converts to red
- zup converts to yellow

In the second example:
- lug converts to blue
- wif immediately following lug converts to red

In the third example:
- wif at the beginning converts to red
- dax converts to green
- lug converts to blue
- walm (occurring twice) converts to blue both times

Now let's check the fourth example, which has multiple appearances of dax and walm, to see if the conversions are consistent:
- lug converts to blue
- dax converts to green, consistent with previous examples
- zup converts to yellow, consistent with previous examples
- dax converts to green again, showing consistency
- walm converts to green, but this is inconsistent with the third example where walm converted to blue
- wif at the end converts to red

In the fifth example:
- wif at the beginning converts to red
- zup converts to yellow

Based on these examples, 'wif' appears to always convert to 'red'. It seems independent of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for 'wif' appears to be consistent:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator for the color associated with the previous word. For instance:

* ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and again ""bluf"" duplicates it.
* When there are multiple words in the input, each word seems to have a unique color associated with it, and ""bluf"" continues to duplicate the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. dax walm lug -> green green green blue

Next, I will analyze the transition patterns from inputs to outputs.

- In all instances where ""walm"" is used, it is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm"" appeared.
- The number of repetitions of colors appears to equal the number of nonce words inserted in the sequence right before ""walm.""

Here is the evidence supporting these observations:
- In the first sequence, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In the second sequence, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow""), and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times before the pattern continues with ""lug"" (blue) and other words.
- In the third sequence, after ""lug"" (blue) and ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice before the sequence continues with ""wif"" (red) and other words.
- In the fourth sequence, ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the fifth sequence, ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm"" which results in ""green"" repeated three times before continuing to ""lug"" (blue).

Based on the patterns, it seems ""walm"" is a rule that tells us to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately prior to ""walm"" a certain number of times.

To construct a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" requires the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm,"" and the number of repetitions is the same as the number of words from the start to ""walm"" (including ""walm"").",-0.11592237117697671,88,walm

- ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"" (meaning ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times).
- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"" (meaning ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" three times).

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, we need to analyze the patterns and the corresponding outputs carefully.

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""bluf"" is not repeated in any other example, making it difficult to determine its meaning directly.

2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again. The appearance of ""walm"" before ""wif"" results in an extra ""green.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - In this case, ""wif"" once again corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" turns the subsequent color to ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Following ""wif,"" the repetition of ""red"" suggests an effect connected with ""walm.""

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Again, ""walm"" seems to affect the word immediately after it, with the color ""green"" preceding it.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" has a duplicating effect on the color that is directly associated with the immediately preceding word. This is evident in the repetition of the color ""green"" when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the additional ""red"" after ""wif walm.""

Based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm duplicates the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Therefore:

walm -> duplicates the preceding color",-0.06247692278796873,89,walm
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the provided examples.

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   
   In this example, 'dax' is translated to 'green', so it isn't part of 'walm'. 'Wif' transforms to 'red', so 'walm' must produce two 'green' outputs before 'wif' turns the output to 'red'.

2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   
   Here, 'lug' is 'blue', 'dax' is still 'green', and 'zup' is 'yellow'. 'Dax' appears again as 'green', followed by 'walm', which precedes 'wif' that turns into 'red'. Before 'wif', there are three 'green' corresponding to the 'dax' and 'walm'.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
   'Wif' is 'red' at the beginning. After 'walm', there's one instance of 'red' before 'dax' turns to 'green' and 'zup' to 'yellow'. It seems 'walm' doesn't affect the 'red' from 'wif' in this case.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
   'Zup' is 'yellow', 'wif' is 'red', and after 'walm', there are two occurrences of 'red'. This suggests that 'walm' keeps the color from the previous word (if not green).

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   
   'Dax' changes to 'green', 'walm' follows and continues the green, 'wif' is 'red', and 'zup' is 'yellow'. In this series, 'walm' produces an extra 'green'.

According to these examples, ""walm"" seems to retain the color of the previous word unless the previous word is 'dax', which is green. In the case of 'dax', it adds extra instances of 'green' before a new color word appears.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word unless it is 'dax', in which case it multiplies the 'green' output before the appearance of the next color word.",-0.0746863727350937,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in each example. We will track the position of ""walm"" and what follows it.

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" also to ""red"". The term ""walm"" appears between ""dax"" and ""wif"".

2. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red

""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""Walm"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""wif"". ""Wif"" corresponds to red.

3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Here, the term ""walm"" comes between two instances of the word that corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"".

4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

""Walm"" is at the end and follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"".

5. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""Walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"".

Based on the above observations:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, it is followed by an instance of ""red"" in the output, indicating that ""walm"" could be a continuation or a cause for a repetition of the color immediately preceding it.
- ""Walm"" does not correspond to any new color; it's always placed between the same colors in the output.

Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previous color in the sequence until a new color word appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the previous color word in the output sequence until a new color word appears.",-0.09984754368516663,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the placement of the word and the corresponding output colors in each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red red
2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif | Output: blue green yellow green green green red
3. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
4. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
5. Input: dax walm wif zup | Output: green green green red yellow

In each case, the appearance of ""walm"" results in an extra instance of the color that precedes it:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" there are two more instances of green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" again corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" green appears again.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" there are two instances of red.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" there are two instances of green followed by a different color (yellow) which corresponds to ""zup"".

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word just before it (doubles the output color). Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it, effectively doubling its output.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word (doubles the output color of the preceding word).",-0.32103771126662495,89,walm
"Rule:
Based on the given examples, when walm is used in a sequence, the output following walm consists of a series of red followed by the next color in the sequence. Each instance of walm is directly followed by multiple reds before finally transitioning to the next color.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for walm:
- When walm appears, it is followed by a series of ""red"", specifically three times, before continuing with the output pattern that would have followed without the interruption caused by walm.

In every example, we can observe this pattern:
- ""dax walm wif"" produces ""green green green red red red"" before resuming with the color that represents ""wif"" (red).
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", as seen in the last example (""dax walm wif zup""), it results in ""green green green red red red yellow"", again adhering to the red replication pattern before resuming with the color corresponding to the word following ""walm"".

2. ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green.""
3. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue.""
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green.""
5. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red.""

Comparing inputs and outputs, we can notice the following patterns:

- When other words such as ""zup"" or ""lug"" appear before ""walm"" without ""dax"" being immediately before ""walm,"" their colors (""yellow"" for ""zup,"" ""blue"" for ""lug"") repeat.
- The word ""walm"" itself appears to cause a repetition effect, extending the previous color mentioned.

Now, we can deduce that ""walm"" serves as a rule for repetition. More specifically:

- If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""green"" is repeated thrice.
- If any other colored word precedes ""walm"" directly (without ""dax"" being in between), that color is repeated thrice.
- No information is given about ""wif"" directly preceding ""walm,"" as it always appears with ""zup.""

"Given the context provided in the examples where ""zup"" always precedes a color and considering the pattern of colors, we can deduce the following:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- There is no example provided for what ""bluf"" might correspond to, but in the context given, it is followed by the color ""green"". If we assume that ""bluf"" in the input mirrors its output color, it could also mean ""green"", but this is a bit speculative.

The word ""zup"" precedes a color in the output every time it appears, and that color is always ""yellow"". Therefore, we can infer the meaning of ""zup"" is related to the color ""yellow"".

- ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" which results in another ""yellow.""

2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is two ""green.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" followed by ""bluf"" which again results in another ""green.""

3. ""Bluf"" after ""zup"" translates to another ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf 
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

- ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and results in a repeated ""yellow.""

4. ""Bluf"" following ""wif"" translates to a repeated ""red.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" leads to another ""red.""

5. The pattern holds in the fifth case as well.

"Rule: From the given examples, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value of the immediately preceding word in the input.

Examples to support the rule:

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue
- Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: dax bluf

Therefore: 
bluf -> the color value is the same as the color value of the word immediately before it.",-0.07954811321260875,91,bluf
"To induce the rule governing the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in each given example.

1. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue

Let's examine the position of ""bluf"" in each input and corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears second and is followed by ""wif,"" which has an output of ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" the same as the preceding word's color, ""zup.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax,"" and its output is ""green,"" mirroring the color for ""dax.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence. The color for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which is the same as the preceding repeated word's color, ""zup.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax."" Both outputs for ""bluf"" and ""wif"" are ""red,"" and for ""dax,"" it's ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""zup."" Its output color is ""red,"" matching ""wif,"" and the subsequent color is ""yellow,"" matching ""zup.""

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word (the word that comes immediately before ""bluf""). If the word appears in a set where it has a repeated word before it, ""bluf"" takes the color of that repeated word even if the immediate predecessor is a different word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word or the color of the repeated word, if there is repetition in the sequence before ""bluf.""

- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which means ""yellow,"" making ""bluf"" also ""yellow.""
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" so ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" again follows ""wif"" (red), hence ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and the corresponding output patterns:

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow 
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by three instances of ""yellow"".

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" does not have a direct output equivalent but seems to modify the output after ""lug wif"" to produce two reds instead of one.
   - After ""walm,"" there are three ""red"" before ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"".

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but the presence of ""bluf"" seems to cause it to be repeated.

4. Input: dax walm wif zup -> Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".
   
5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

By examining the patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that comes right before it three times in the output. In each instance, the color word just before ""walm"" is repeated three times immediately after ""walm"" in the output.

Rule: walm -> the word that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.",-0.08285996993852526,91,walm
"Observing the provided input and output examples, let's try to deduce the rule for the nonce word 'walm'.

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" which suggests that 'walm' might result in repeating the color corresponding to the word that appears before it, in this case, 'zup' yields 'yellow'.

- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"", it seems 'walm' results in the repetition of 'red', which is the color corresponding to the word 'wif'. Here, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'bluf' is not repeated, which supports the idea that 'walm' causes a repetition only of the color associated with the word occurring immediately before it.

- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax walm wif bluf"" and ""dax walm wif zup"" translate to ""green green green red red"" and ""green green green red yellow"" respectively. Again, 'walm' leads to the repetition of 'green', the color for 'dax', indicating 'walm' triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word.

- The fifth example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"", confirms the pattern, with 'walm' resulting in the repetition of 'yellow', the color for 'zup'.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that 'walm' causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it, three times.",-0.1936290809494949,91,walm
"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, three times. To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.
- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", so it becomes ""red red red"".
- In ""dax walm wif bluf"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green"", so ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
- Similarly, in ""dax walm wif zup"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the pattern continues as ""green green green"".
- Finally, in ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", hence ""yellow yellow yellow"".

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the patterns from the given inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here are the inputs with their outputs:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
3. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
4. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
5. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue

Now, let's look for patterns:

- In examples 1 and 2, swapping ""dax"" and ""bluf"" changes the color from green to yellow and vice versa, suggesting that ""bluf"" could represent the color ""yellow"" in one instance and ""green"" in the other. The position of ""bluf"" relative to ""dax"" appears to influence the color it represents.

- In example 3, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" with the output of ""bluf"" being ""yellow.""

- In example 4, ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax,"" and its output is ""yellow.""

- In example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and its output is ""blue.""

Based on these observations, we can see a connection between the position of ""bluf"" and the colors ""yellow"" and ""green."" ""Bluf"" seems to represent ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or when it comes before ""lug"" or ""dax."" However, when ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" its color is ""blue.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be conditional on the words surrounding it:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it is ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" comes before ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it is ""yellow.""
- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Based on the above rules, the meaning in each context is as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or precedes ""lug"" or ""dax."" ""Bluf"" represents ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""",-0.10884707458625305,92,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the position it appears in the input and the corresponding output color. By comparing the various examples, we can try to identify a pattern.

From the first two examples:
1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green

In both examples, ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"". What changes is the position of ""bluf"". In the first example, ""bluf"" is in the third position resulting in ""yellow,"" and in the second example ""bluf"" is in the second position also resulting in ""yellow."" From this, we can initially speculate that ""bluf"" might also mean ""yellow"" regardless of its position.

Looking at the rest of the examples:
1. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
2. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
3. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue

In the third and fourth examples, ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and its position seems to result in the same color output, supporting its meaning. However, ""bluf,"" which was hypothesized to possibly mean ""yellow,"" does not consistently result in ""yellow"" - in the fourth example, it results in ""yellow,"" but in the third, it does not appear to have a corresponding output color. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is last and also results in ""blue,"" which disrupts the hypothesis that ""bluf"" unilaterally means ""yellow.""

""Bluf"" does not seem to directly correspond to a single color based on these examples. Instead, we should consider a rule that depends on the context in which ""bluf"" appears. 

Let's consider the position of ""bluf"" and the output regardless of the other words:
1. In the first and second positions, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow."" 
2. In the third, fourth, and last positions, ""bluf"" does not result in ""yellow.""

Looking at the last example:
lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue

Here ""bluf"" is in the last position, and the first and third positions are the same word ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue."" In this case ""bluf"" also results in ""blue."" This could suggest that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that appears most frequently prior to it in the sequence, or, if it appears first or second, it defaults to ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can construct the following rule:
Rule: ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" when it is in the first or second position. When in the third position or later, it takes the color of the word that appears most frequently in the sequence prior to ""bluf."" If there is a tie or no repetitions, the examples do not provide enough information to deduce the outcome.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:
bluf -> Rule: ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" when in the first or second position. Otherwise, it results in the color of the most frequently occurring word before it in the sequence.",-0.1235781476079518,92,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be a color-coding system where each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""bluf"" consistently results in the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" represents the color yellow in this context.

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"".

Here is an analysis of each instance:

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
(Here, ""walm"" seems to represent multiple instances of the color associated with ""lug"", which is blue)

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
(Again, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color associated with the preceding word that's a color, ""dax"" which is green)

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
(Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and replicates the blue thrice)

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
(This is identical to the first example, providing further evidence that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"")

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
(""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" which is green)

Based on the above examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat thrice the color of the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word is associated with a color, ""walm"" translates to that color being repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule could be defined as:

Rule: walm -> Replicate the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",-0.11271886908791669,92,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word 'walm' corresponds to a repetition of the color that follows the word 'lug'. To be more specific, the word 'walm' seems to trigger the repetition of the color that is the output for 'lug', which is 'blue'. This repetition happens three times regardless of the other words present in the input. Here is the observed pattern:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (The word 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', which is then repeated three times.)
- ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red"" (The word 'walm' causes 'green', which is the output for 'dax', to repeat three times followed by the output for 'wif', which is 'red'.)
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green"" (After 'zup' which is 'yellow' and 'lug' which is 'blue', 'walm' causes 'blue' to repeat three times, followed by 'red' for 'wif' and 'green' for 'dax'.)

Therefore, it's valid to conclude that in this context, each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Specifically for dax:

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the outputs. The presence of ""dax"" always corresponds to the word ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning: ""dax"" means ""green"".",-1.7994037535913792,93,dax

- wif lug -> red blue
- zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
- lug dax wif -> blue green red

2. dax wif bluf -> green red red
3. wif lug -> red blue
4. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
5. lug dax wif -> blue green red

Looking at the sequence of colors:

Input 1 (without wif): zup lug bluf zup bluf -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow
Output 1 (with wif at the end): yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Input 2 (first word dax, second word wif): dax wif bluf -> green red red
Input 3 (wif as first word): wif lug -> red blue
In both cases, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. It is independent of the position in the sequence.

Input 4: zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
In this input, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. But ""wif"" still corresponds to red.

Input 5: lug dax wif -> blue green red

In all instances, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it.

"Based on the provided examples, there seems to be a pattern where each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" (as seen in example 4 where it follows ""lug"" and yields another ""blue"")

In every example where ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"". However, this output is also the case for ""bluf"". To determine the rule for ""wif,"" we need to look at where it differs from ""bluf"". 

In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and ""wif"" outputs ""red"". So, ""wif"" could mean ""red"" when following ""bluf"". 

However, in examples 3 and 5, ""wif"" appears without ""bluf"" before it, and the output is still ""red"". This indicates that the meaning of ""wif"" is not contingent upon ""bluf"".

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's break down each example and look for patterns:

1. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
2. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
4. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

The first observation is that ""bluf"" always results in a repetition of the color word that precedes it. 

- In examples 1 and 5, the word ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is red repeated twice.
- In example 2, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is green repeated twice.
- In examples 3 and 4, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is blue repeated twice.

The only deviation from this pattern is in example 3, where a sequence of words leads to a sequence of repeated colors before ""bluf."" The sequence ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, each color word is repeated once for every time it appears before bluf, except for the last occurrence of ""lug,"" which comes just before ""bluf"" and causes the color blue to be repeated twice.

Based on these examples, ""bluf"" seems to double the color of the word that immediately precedes it. However, for a sequence of color words preceding ""bluf,"" each color word leads to the repetition of that color, following its number of occurrences before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning

"Rule: bluf -> the color that is mentioned just before it, repeated once. 

Explanation: In every example, the word ""bluf"" is followed by the color that is mentioned immediately before it, and this color is repeated once more.

- ""lug wif bluf"" becomes ""blue red red"" because ""wif"" represents ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- ""wif dax bluf"" becomes ""red green green"" because ""dax"" represents ""green"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" suggesting that ""walm"" may represent ""blue"", and ""lug"" which stands for ""blue"" is followed by ""bluf"", thus repeating ""blue"" again.
- ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" represents ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" because ""wif"" represents ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color.

So, ""bluf"" functions as a duplicator for the preceding color word in the sequence.",-0.13248855064613327,93,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" is a word that repeats the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it. Here's a closer examination of the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""wif"" for red, and then ""bluf"" which repeats the red, resulting in ""blue red red.""
- The second example shows ""wif"" as red, followed by ""dax"" for green, and ""bluf,"" repeating the green again, resulting in ""red green green.""
- The third example has ""lug"" repeated twice (blue), with ""wif"" in the middle (red), and then ""bluf,"" which repeats the blue from ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue red blue blue.""
- The fourth example shows ""dax"" corresponding to green, followed by ""zup"" for yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the yellow, resulting in ""green yellow yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided.

1. In the first example, the presence of ""lug"" before ""bluf"" led to the output ""blue red red."" 
2. In the second example, ""wif"" before ""bluf"" resulted in the output ""red green green.""
3. In the third example, varying combinations of ""lug"" and ""wif"" before ""bluf"" resulted in repeating the color associated with the word before ""bluf"" twice after the initial sequence of colors.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" before ""bluf"" led to ""green yellow yellow.""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" before ""bluf"" with no other words led to ""red red,"" showing a direct repetition of the color associated with ""wif.""

From the examples given, we can observe that ""bluf"" results in the last color word mentioned being repeated twice.

Here's the deduction:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the last mentioned color word twice.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should observe its associations with the colors in the outputs and look for patterns.

- In the first example, ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green"", and ""zup walm"" (without ""dax"") translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests that ""walm"" may contribute to the repetition of ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" changes the last color to green.
  
- In the second example, we see again that ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" follows, we get repeated ""yellow"" output as deduced before.

- The third example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" has an output of ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" yields ""red"", ""dax"" yields ""green,"" ""zup"" repeats the ""yellow,"" and then we have two additional ""yellow"" coming from ""walm.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm,"" it translates to ""green blue blue blue."" This tells us that ""lug"" contributes to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" here again seems to cause a repetition effect, resulting in two extra ""blue"" in the output.

- The fifth example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" with an output of ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" again shows ""lug"" leading to ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous output color (in this case ""blue""), ""dax"" yields ""green,"" and then ""wif"" yields ""red.""

From these observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the previous word's color to be repeated in the output.
- The repetition continues until another word with a defined color (such as ""dax"" or ""wif"") follows.

Rule:
walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated in the output until a word with a different associated color appears.",-0.1203875738828,94,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm"" based on the examples provided, let's identify patterns of input and corresponding output:

1. ""zup walm"" always corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that both ""zup"" and ""walm"" translate to ""yellow.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it occurs after ""walm"" (Example 4) and before ""walm"" (Example 1). Hence, the word ""dax"" consistently means ""green"" regardless of its position relative to ""walm.""
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" whether it is before ""walm"" (Example 3) or after it (Example 5).
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it appears before ""walm"" (Example 4 and Example 5).

Now, considering these patterns, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. If there is no word before ""walm,"" it seems to default to the color ""yellow,"" as suggested by Example 2. Here's the breakdown of the rules applied:

- ""zup walm"" = ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif dax zup walm"" = ""red green yellow yellow yellow""; ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" because of the preceding ""zup.""
- ""dax lug walm"" = ""green blue blue blue""; ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" because of the preceding ""lug.""
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" = ""blue blue blue green red blue red""; ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" because of the preceding ""lug.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the provided examples and analyze the patterns of the outputs in relation to the placement of ""walm"" within each input.

Here are the patterns observed:

1. Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, a sequence of ""yellow"" appears in the output.
2. The number of ""yellow"" in the output is one less than the number of words in the input following ""walm."" For example:
   - ""zup walm dax"" has one word after ""walm"" and results in one ""yellow"" followed by a ""green"" in the output.
   - ""zup walm"" has no words after ""walm,"" and we see only yellow colors in the output.
3. When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the ""yellow"" sequence is suspended and it is followed by a ""green.""
4. In the presence of other words (not ""walm""), colors such as ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue"" are outputted which correspond to ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" respectively.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be summarized as follows:

""walm"" results in a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output. The length of the sequence is one less than the number of words that follow ""walm"" in the input; if ""walm"" is immediately followed by ""dax,"" the ""yellow"" sequence is instead followed by a ""green.""

Rule: walm -> Initiates a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output, with the sequence being one less than the number of words following ""walm."" If followed by ""dax,"" the sequence is immediately followed by ""green.""",-0.8787551585564706,94,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated one or more times, corresponding to how many times ""walm"" is said. If ""walm"" is used multiple times consecutively, the color repeats for each instance of ""walm"".

"Based on the examples provided, there seems to be a pattern where the output color sequences repeat certain colors for specific input words. Specifically, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output color sequence seems to repeat the color that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" and in the output, ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""wif,"" is repeated once after the first ""red"" (which also corresponds to ""wif"").
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""zup"") is repeated.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" repeats.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and once again, ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.

Based on the pattern noted, the rule seems to be that the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before ""bluf"" is repeated once in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word in the sequence.",-1.2015665567229548,95,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" when following the input ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug."" However, when following one ""wif"" or more non-""bluf"" words (especially if ""wif"" is the most recent word), it outputs ""red"" twice. In the last example, even though ""wif"" is not directly before ""bluf"" (with ""lug"" and ""zup"" in between), it still results in ""bluf"" translating to ""yellow."" These observations suggest that ""bluf"" translates differently based on its proximity and relation to the word ""wif.""

Therefore, the most consistent rule that accounts for all examples is:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" directly or is preceded by a sequence of words where ""wif"" was the last unique word before a repeated ""bluf,"" it translates to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" without a preceding ""wif"" or other contextual modifiers, it translates to ""blue.""

In summary:

- ""wif bluf"" -> bluf translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug bluf"" without a ""wif"" -> bluf translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" without a previous ""bluf"" -> bluf translates to ""red"" twice

"Based on the provided examples, we can observe how ""walm"" affects the output of the sequence. Let's analyze the patterns:

Example 1:
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
- Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Example 2:
- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
- Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Example 3:
- Input: lug walm zup wif
- Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Example 4:
- Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
- Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Example 5:
- Input: dax lug walm zup wif
- Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Based on these examples, we can notice that whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the word following ""walm"" results in a color sequence that follows the pattern of ""blue yellow red,"" or it introduces a ""blue"" color before the color that would normally be associated with the following word. This can be seen in Example 3, where ""walm zup wif"" results in ""blue yellow red,"" and in other examples, ""walm"" causes a ""blue"" to be added before the continuation of the pattern.

Considering this, we can induce the rule that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a rule that adds a ""blue"" output or otherwise affects the sequence to produce ""blue"" as the next color in the pattern.

Rule:
walm -> Introduces a ""blue"" in the sequence or results in the pattern ""blue yellow red"" depending on the following word.",-0.061927954371536566,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to observe its use across different examples and the corresponding output. 

In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the output sequence corresponding to this is ""blue blue."" When ""walm"" appears, the next color in the sequence is a repeat of the color immediately preceding ""walm.""

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

In the second example, ""walm"" again follows ""bluf,"" and the output sequence for ""bluf wif walm"" is ""red red red,"" again showing a repetition of the color before ""walm.""

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

In the third example:

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output has ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" caused the repetition of the color ""blue.""

In the fourth example, we see ""walm"" repeat the pattern of causing the next color in the sequence to repeat the previous color. 

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

In the fifth example:

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Again, ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color before it in the sequence.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" is an operation that causes the next color in the sequence to repeat the color that appeared immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that comes immediately before ""walm"" in the sequence.",-0.06583457794163415,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for a pattern that corresponds to the output for each time ""walm"" appears. Let's start by examining each instance where ""walm"" is used and its corresponding output.

- In the first example, the sequence ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to the output ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" but here it is preceded by ""walm"" resulting in ""blue,"" we can assume that ""walm"" has an influence on the color output of the subsequent word.
  
- In the second example, we see that ""walm lug"" leads to ""red blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" may not necessarily change ""lug's"" output color (which is ""blue"") but may have influenced the preceding word, which was ""wif"" resulting in ""red,"" appearing again after ""lug.""

- The third and fourth examples further support the notion that ""walm"" may change the output color of the following word. With ""lug walm zup wif"" translating to ""blue blue blue yellow red"" and ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" being ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif"" becomes ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" and the color changes to ""blue"" instead of the expected ""yellow.""

Given these observations, we see that whenever ""walm"" appears, the color output that follows it is ""blue,"" regardless of what the original color should be, except when ""wif"" follows, then the output is ""red.""

Therefore, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes any word, the output color for that word is altered to ""blue,"" except when it is ""wif,"" which results in ""red.""

walm -> causes the following word to change color to ""blue,"" except when following word is ""wif,"" then it changes to ""red.""",-0.708922383091707,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs and look for patterns related to ""walm.""

1st example:
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" (since ""dax bluf"" results in ""green red"").

The output ""green blue blue blue green red red green"" seemingly doesn't relate directly to the ""walm"" in the input. However, ""walm"" appears before the sequence of two ""blue"" outputs.

2nd example:
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" to ""green.""
- Here, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green,"" consistent with the 1st example.
- ""walm"" occurs, and following it is ""lug wif,"" which outputs as ""red blue red.""

3rd example:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" appears for the first time, with the output following ""walm zup"" being ""blue yellow red.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4th example:
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- After ""walm zup"" and ""walm zup,"" the sequence is ""red yellow"" twice.

5th example:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as usual.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- After ""walm zup,"" we have ""blue yellow red.""

In all examples, each time ""walm"" appears, the output sequence has a ""blue"" followed by another color except when ""walm"" is the last word (like in the 1st example). The color that follows ""blue"" appears to be determined by the word immediately following ""walm."" Specifically, when ""lug"" is immediately after ""walm,"" we get ""blue blue,"" and when ""zup"" is immediately after ""walm,"" we get ""blue yellow.""

However, the only constant is that ""blue"" immediately follows ""walm,"" while the subsequent color varies based on the word after ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and is followed by ""lug."" The pattern ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red blue.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" is within a sequence that alternates colors, but it consistently results in ""blue"" regardless of the preceding word.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and is followed by ""zup."" The pattern ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

4. zup dax lug dax -> yellow green blue green

Analyzing each line:

1. dax preceding walm turns everything green.
2. dax following wif turns dax itself green, and wif is red.
3. dax preceding lug turns dax green and lug blue, while walm remains green.
4. dax following zup turns dax green, and preceding lug turns lug blue and the second dax is also green.
5. dax preceding bluf turns dax and bluf green, following wif turns wif red, following zup turns zup yellow, and preceding lug turns lug blue.

Based on the examples, ""dax"" appears to be an indicator for the color green when it stands alone or before a word not specifically associated with another color (as in ""dax"" before ""walm"" or ""bluf"").

- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"".
- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"".
- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"".

Additionally, when ""bluf"" comes after two different words, each word is translated into its color twice in the same order:

- ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" becomes ""green green yellow yellow green"".
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"".
- ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" becomes ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can try to establish the rules governing the assignment of colors:

- ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to ""green.""
- ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to ""yellow"" (example 2) and ""blue"" (example 5) when it is followed by ""lug.""
- ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to ""red.""

Now, let's look at ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (examples 1, 2, and 3), it seems to cause ""wif"" to repeat its color ""red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (examples 1, 3), the color ""green"" is sustained.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""zup,"" resulting in green green green yellow, so ""walm"" does not influence the change to yellow.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is the last word with two ""zup"" words before it, resulting in only ""yellow"" outputs, which suggests ""walm"" might have repeated ""yellow.""

From these observations, a potential rule for ""walm"" could be that it causes the previous color to repeat. However, this is not consistent when ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" in example 4, as it does not repeat ""green"" before changing to ""yellow."" 

Another possibility is that ""walm"" might be a sort of ""wildcard"" that takes on the value of the preceding color or causes it to repeat, except when a transition is expected (as in ""zup"" after ""dax,"" which seems to always yield ""yellow""). But since ""zup"" in example 5 also yields yellow, it suggests that ""walm"" could simply prolong the previous color output as well.

Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""walm"" could be a rule that extends the sequence of the current color pattern, but it does not override transitions that are already established by the sequence (like ""dax"" followed by ""zup"").

Rule:
walm -> Extends the sequence of the current color unless there is a transition that would otherwise occur as established by other words in the sequence.",-0.07290063542255339,97,walm
"To decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the relationship between the input sequences that contain ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs. Below are the analyses of the given examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" appears to correlate with ""green""
   - ""wif"" appears to correlate with ""red""
   - ""zup"" appears to correlate with ""yellow""

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - Adding to the above, ""bluf"" correlates with ""yellow"" 

3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - Considering previous correlations, ""walm"" in this case might not have a direct color correlation. It continued the sequence of ""green"" before ""wif.""

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""walm"" here again extended the ""green"" sequence.

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to extend the ""yellow"" instead of introducing a new color.

Based on the analysis, it seems that ""walm"" doesn't have its own unique output color. Instead, it appears to repeat or extend the color output of the preceding word. To summarize:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that comes immediately before it. Rule: If a nonce word X is followed by ""walm,"" then the output color associated with X is repeated for ""walm.""",-0.07745766080387377,97,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns and colors associated with each instance of ""walm"" in the examples provided.

In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here we see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" appears in two places. Before the first ""walm,"" we have ""dax,"" which is green, and after the first ""walm,"" we have ""wif,"" which is red. The second ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which is yellow.

In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Bluf"" is associated with ""yellow,"" which doesn't seem to be the rule for ""dax"" or ""zup,"" so ""bluf"" may have its own color or function. However, if ""bluf"" were to have its own color, we would expect it to have a unique color code, which it doesn't. This suggests that ""bluf"" is not introducing a new color but might be repeating the previous color (""zup"" in this case). The ""walm"" here is followed by red, the color for ""wif.""

In the third example, ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow."" Again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and is followed by ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

In the fourth example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" ""Dax"" correlates with green, and ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), then by ""wif"" (red).

In the final example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""lug,"" we have a ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" ""Walm"" here is followed by only ""yellow.""

From these examples, we notice that ""walm"" is not associated with a fixed color but seems to be related to repetition or continuation of the color that comes immediately before it. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the color code that immediately precedes it continues for a sequence following it. Specifically:
- In the first example, ""green"" appears multiple times after ""dax"" before the first ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""yellow"" appears multiple times after ""zup"" before ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""green"" appears multiple times before ""walm.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" does not repeat a color but is followed by a color (""yellow"") that occurred just before it.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition or continuation of the previous color mentioned. When ""walm"" follows a color, the corresponding output color repeats until a new color word appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color indicated by the word immediately before it. If a new color word is introduced, ""walm"" takes on that new color until the next color word appears.",-0.0996792657871845,97,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will analyze the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first input, the presence of ""walm"" results in a sequence of ""red"" in the output. The sequence is two ""red"" for each ""walm.""
  
- In the second input, the presence of a single ""walm"" yields two ""red"" in the output.

- In the third input, ""walm"" again corresponds to two instances of ""red"" in the output.

- In the fourth input, the output contains two ""green"" and a single ""red"" following ""dax walm,"" suggesting that ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and might alter the number of colors following; however, ""walm"" consistently relates to the color ""red.""

- In the fifth input, there is a single ""walm"" at the end, and it results in two ""yellow"" in the output.

So we have a consistent pattern that each ""walm"" is followed by two colors. ""Walm"" is mostly followed by red except for the fifth input, where it is followed by the color that preceded it, which was ""yellow.""

Taking this into account, a plausible rule for ""walm"" considering this last inconsistency could be that it either produces a pattern of two repeating colors that come after it, or it changes the sequence based on the context, such as the words that precede it.

However, given the inconsistency and lack of data to definitively define the context-based rules, the safest rule we can set is:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at correlated inputs and outputs to identify a pattern.

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
2. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
3. ""wif zup dax"" -> ""red yellow green""
4. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue"" (repeated example, consistent output)
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

We observe that every output contains the color ""green"" when the word ""dax"" is present in the input. Since ""dax"" is common in each of these inputs and ""green"" is common in each corresponding output, that suggests the word ""dax"" itself translates to ""green.""

However, it's also possible that ""dax"" modifies the following word to add ""green"" to the output. Since we don't see ""dax"" followed by multiple different words producing the same output and since we don't have examples of ""dax"" on its own, it is difficult to tell if it is a standalone word or a modifier without more context. Given the available information, a simple interpretation is best.

"From the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to be a repeated sequence of a color word, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input sequence (including ""walm""). 

To illustrate:

1. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" – Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" is followed by one other word (itself), we have three ""blue"" in the output.

2. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue red green"" – ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The three ""blue"" in the output correspond to ""lug walm wif"" with ""walm"" causing the repetition.

3. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" – Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows, leading to a triple ""green"" in the output.

4. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" outputs ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"" – ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" there is ""zup"" and another ""lug,"" indicating ""walm"" caused the quadruple count of ""blue,"" with the sequence finishing with the colors for the last ""zup lug.""

5. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"" – As before, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""walm"" comes at the end and is followed by two words (including itself), it creates a triple ""red"" in the output.

Based on the patterns observed, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, with the number of repetitions equal to the total number of words following ""walm"" (including itself).

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to trigger repeated output of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the rule I induced from the examples:

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" — so ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in repeating the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) three times.
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting again in ""blue"" being repeated three times after ""yellow,"" which is associated with ""zup.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that the color associated with ""dax"" (green) is repeated three times.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" produces ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" ""Lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red,"" with ""wif"" before ""walm"" resulting in ""red"" repeated three times.

From this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" requires repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. 

Thus:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.12209465535416666,98,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be repeated in the output a number of times that correlates with the position it is in the input sequence. Additionally, each non-walm word translates to a different color. To validate this, we need to assign a color to each word and then verify the repetition pattern:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Now, let's analyze the repetition pattern of ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows the first word ""lug,"" so it has no repetitions preceding it, and ""walm"" itself is repeated three times.

2. In the second example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" Here, ""walm"" is in the third position and is repeated three times, following the trend.

3. ""Dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" Again, ""walm"" is in the second position and is repeated three times.

4. For ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" the output is ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" ""Walm"" is the fourth word in the sequence and is repeated three times.

5. Lastly, ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" is in the third position and is repeated three times.

From these observations, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word, repeated three times. So if ""walm"" follows a word that translates to ""blue,"" it will produce ""blue blue blue.""

Using this rule, ""walm"" would be defined as:

- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue.""

- In input two, ""lug walm"" within the longer sequence results in ""blue blue blue"" again, following the same pattern.
- The third example reinforces this as ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".
- The fourth example shows ""lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"" within a longer sequence.

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow

Based on the examples, we observe the following patterns:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is in the corresponding output.
- ""lug"" appears before other color words in the input, such as ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" which correspond to the colors red and blue, respectively.

"Analyzing the provided input and output pairs, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" based on its position and the resulting color in the output.

- Here, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and is at the end of the input, resulting in ""green"".

Input: wif walm dax zup

- ""dax"" is after ""zup"" and before ""lug"", resulting in ""green"".

1. ""zup dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow green red yellow""
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> ""blue yellow yellow green""
   In this case, ""dax"" is at the end again, and it corresponds to ""green.""

3. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.07412525595265565,100,dax
"To determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to look at the patterns of the inputs and outputs provided. Each instance of ""dax"" and its corresponding output sequence can give us insight into what ""dax"" could represent.

Here are the examples with a focus on dax:

1. Input: zup dax wif zup | Output: yellow green red yellow
2. Input: lug zup bluf dax | Output: blue yellow yellow green
3. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
4. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax | Output: yellow green green yellow green
5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug | Output: yellow green blue blue yellow blue

Analyzing the outputs, here's what we can deduce:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow), and ""dax"" translates to green.
- In example 2, ""dax"" comes after ""bluf"" (yellow) and there's nothing after it. ""Dax"" still translates to green.
- In example 3, ""dax"" is preceded by ""walm"" (red) and followed by ""zup"" (yellow), and ""dax"" translates to green.
- In example 4, ""dax"" is both preceded and followed by ""bluf"" (yellow) and ""zup"" (yellow) in the string, and in both instances, ""dax"" translates to green.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is both preceded by ""zup"" (yellow) and followed by ""lug"" (blue), and ""dax"" still translates to green.

Looking at these examples, we can see that no matter what precedes or follows ""dax,"" the output color for it is always green. There is no indication that its position or neighboring words change its meaning. Therefore, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.

- ""wif"" corresponds to red

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the correlation between the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue""
2. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
3. ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow""
4. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue""
5. ""dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow""

From these examples, we can try to identify a pattern for the outputs based on the word ""walm"":

- In every output where ""walm"" is used, we see a repetition of colors.
- The number of repeated colors corresponds to the number of words in the input before ""walm"", excluding the word ""walm"" itself.

Now let's try to apply this pattern to deduce the rule for ""walm"":

1. ""zug lug walm"" has two words before ""walm"" and two ""blue""s after ""blue"", which corresponds to ""lug"".
2. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" has three words before ""walm"" and three ""blue""s after ""blue"", which also corresponds to ""lug"".
3. ""dax walm wif zup"" has one word before ""walm"" and one ""green"" after ""green"", which corresponds to ""dax"".
4. ""lug walm"" has one word before ""walm"" and two ""blue""s following, which corresponds to ""lug"".
5. ""dax walm zup"" has one word before ""walm"" and two ""green""s after ""green"", which corresponds to ""dax"".

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. The number of repetitions of the color is equal to the number of times the word before ""walm"" appears in the input phrase. Given that green corresponds to ""dax"" and blue to ""lug,"" in every instance, ""walm"" follows the color associated with the word before it.

Rule: walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, as many times as that word appears before ""walm"" in the input.",-0.13816327483560975,100,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is an additional number of ""blue"" equal to the number of ""blue"" already shown for ""lug"" plus one. For example:
  Input: ""zup lug walm"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue"" (""lug"" corresponds to one ""blue,"" and ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"" and one extra for a total of three additional ""blue"").
  Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" (""lug"" corresponds to one ""blue,"" and ""walm"" adds two more and one extra ""blue"" before the sequence repeats with ""zup"" that corresponds to ""yellow"").
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three ""green"" with no additional color following, regardless of what ""dax"" and ""walm"" originally mean on their own:
  Input: ""dax walm wif zup"" -> Output: ""green green green red yellow"" (""wif"" is not influencing the number of ""green"" corresponding to ""walm"").
  Input: ""dax walm zup"" -> Output: ""green green green yellow"" (again, three ""green"" followed by the ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"").

However, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" with no ""zup,"" its output is exactly three ""blue"":
  Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""

Given these observations, ""walm"" seems to mean the following:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it a certain number of times. After ""lug,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times. After ""dax,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

However, given the limited examples, it's difficult to define an absolute rule for ""walm"" without more context. The rule may change if ""walm"" follows other words or sequences. Therefore, the rule should be tested with additional data to be considered exhaustive.",-0.2982424171474879,100,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to follow a specific rule:

- In every instance where walm is mentioned, it is followed by multiple instances of the color associated with the word just before it.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In ""zup lug walm,"" the word before walm is lug, which is associated with blue. Hence, walm results in ""blue blue blue.""
2. In ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" again, lug precedes walm and is associated with blue. Walm results in ""blue blue blue,"" then the sequence ends with zup, which is associated with yellow.
3. In ""dax walm wif zup,"" dax is associated with green and precedes walm, leading walm to result in ""green green green.""
4. In ""lug walm,"" lug is associated with blue, and walm results in ""blue blue blue.""
5. In ""dax walm zup,"" dax is associated with green, leading walm to result in ""green green green,"" followed by zup, which is associated with yellow.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", we need to look at the patterns where it appears and the associated output.

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif bluf"", the output is ""green red red"". Since the output color sequence begins with green, it suggests that ""dax"" may be associated with the color green. The ""red red"" sequence might be related to the words ""wif bluf"" and how they follow ""dax"".
- The second instance has ""dax walm wif"", and the corresponding output is ""green green green red"". Once again, we see that the sequence begins with green, reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" may correspond to the color green. Moreover, the ""green green"" might be related to the word ""walm"", as it is the only word that repeats the same color besides ""dax"".
- In the third example, ""dax lug bluf"" gives us ""green blue blue"". As with the previous examples, ""dax"" is followed by green, further supporting the idea that ""dax"" means green.
- When ""dax"" appears by itself, the output is simply ""green"", which is very strong evidence that ""dax"" indeed means green.
- The final example provides a pattern where ""dax"" is at the beginning and at the end, with ""bluf zup bluf"" in the middle. The output sequence is ""green green yellow yellow green"". The green at the beginning and end correspond to ""dax"" and the middle sequence suggests that ""bluf"" is associated with ""yellow"". It is also possible that the second ""green"" corresponds to a rule about sequence or repetition.

Based on these patterns, the clearest rule that can be established is that the word ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green"".

- The fourth input is just ""zup bluf"" and outputs ""yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""zup"" precedes two instances of ""yellow"" and itself corresponds to ""yellow.""

"Following the provided examples and analyzing the corresponding outputs, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color 'yellow', but when it follows another color-related nonce, it corresponds to that same color instead.

Detailing the rule:

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" ""zup"" translates to 'yellow', ""lug"" translates to 'blue', and ""dax"" translates to 'green'. Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is 'yellow', which is the color associated with ""zup"". It seems to mirror the color of the word before it.

2. In the second example, ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to 'green', and ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in 'green', the color associated with ""dax"".

3. The third example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf,"" shows that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and hence gets the output 'yellow', which is the color associated with ""zup"".

4. In the fourth example, ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to 'blue', and ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" so ""bluf"" results in 'blue', akin to the word preceding it.

5. The fifth example, ""zup bluf lug,"" has ""bluf"" after ""zup,"" so ""bluf"" mirrors the color of ""zup"" and thus translates to 'yellow'.

From the above analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that 'walm' generates repeated instances of the color 'blue'. To determine the exact rule, let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

- When ""lug walm"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue blue"". It suggests that both ""lug"" and ""walm"" might produce the color blue, and ""walm"" may also add repetition.
- When ""dax lug walm"" is in the input, ""green blue blue blue"" is in the output. Here, ""dax"" yields green, ""lug"" gives blue once, and ""walm"" follows with additional blues.
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", it results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". We can see that ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""bluf"" give one instance of red, yellow, and blue respectively. ""lug"" again produces blue, and the occurrence of ""walm"" results in multiple blues.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" transforms into ""yellow red red red blue"". This further shows ""lug"" is consistently blue, ""zup"" and ""wif"" are yellow and red, respectively, and ""walm"" converts the following color to red multiple times.
- ""lug walm zup wif"" leading to ""blue blue blue yellow red"" supports that ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" and ""wif"" follow the previously observed yellow and red, and ""walm"" produces repetitive blues.

It's consistent in each example that ""walm"" takes the preceding color and repeats it two additional times. This rule applies regardless of what the color is, as seen in cases where ""lug"" is not the word directly preceding ""walm.""

Thus, the rule appears as follows:

Rule: 'walm' -> Causes the color immediately preceding it to be repeated two additional times. If 'blue' precedes 'walm', the output gives us two additional 'blue'.",-0.22973544904265067,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the given examples. Notice how each input word corresponds to a certain color output. First, let's identify the color corresponding to each known input word by comparing overlapping words and their outputs.

Analyzing the first and second input examples:
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to blue, as it is present in both of these examples and is followed by ""blue"" in the output.
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to yellow since it aligns with ""yellow"" in the outputs when it appears.
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to red, as shown by its consistent mapping in both outputs.

Now we look specifically at ""walm"":
- In the first input, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" in the output (a repeated blue).
- In the second input, ""walm lug"" corresponds to ""red red red blue"" (three reds and a blue), which differs by adding multiple reds, possibly due to the position change of ""lug.""
- In the third input, ""lug walm"" again corresponds to a repetition of blue, ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug walm"" also corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth input, ""lug walm"" consistently corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""

Notice that in all instances of ""walm,"" the output involves a repetition of the color blue except in the input where ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" indicating that the position of ""walm"" and what follows it in the sequence might modify the rule.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition (triplication) of the color that would correspond to the word immediately following ""walm"". When walm precedes lug, the repetition is blue. However, we see an inconsistency when ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,” because the output generates ""red red red blue.” We don't have further examples for what happens to the color output when other words come after ""walm.""

Given the limited data and the inconsistency, the best hypothesis we can generate is that ""walm"" triggers a repetition effect in the output sequence, but the specific rule regarding color change or consistency when positions change is not clear. The rule also appears to be influenced by the word that follows ""walm.”

"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. 

Explanation:

- In the first example ""dax lug walm,"" dax corresponds to green, and lug corresponds to blue. After the word ""walm,"" the color blue (associated with lug) is repeated three times.

- ""lug walm"" simply repeats blue three times since ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

- In ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" dax is green, lug is blue, and zup is yellow. After ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times, as it follows lug. Zup is yellow and is given at the end once, after which lug comes and it is represented as blue once.

- ""dax walm lug"" has dax which is green, followed by walm which causes green to be repeated three times, followed by lug, which is blue.

- ""dax walm zup walm"" has dax (green) followed by walm repeating green three times. Then zup (yellow) is followed by walm making yellow repeat three times.

Therefore, the rule deduced is that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately previous word to be repeated three times.",-0.43576623753552385,102,walm

- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated two additional times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color yellow is repeated two additional times.
- When ""walm"" occurs alone after ""lug,"" it results in three ""blue.""
- “Walm” seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

Based on these observations:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.8391221784628571,102,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a pattern that relates to the word 'walm'. Here is the observed pattern concerning the use of the word 'walm':

1. When 'walm' follows 'dax', the output is a repetition of 'green' three times.
2. When 'walm' follows 'lug', the output is a repetition of 'blue' three times.
3. When 'walm' is between 'dax' and 'lug', it results in 'green' repeated three times, followed by 'blue'.
4. When 'walm' follows 'zup', the output is a repetition of 'yellow' two times.
5. The number of repetitions of the color appears to be determined by the preceding word.

We can then deduce the following rule for 'walm':

Rule: walm following a word repeats the color associated with that word a specific number of times. The number of repetitions is potentially determined by the word preceding 'walm'. For 'dax', it's three times; for 'lug', it's three times; for 'zup', it's two times.

The number of repetitions of this color seems to equal the number of times ""walm"" has been mentioned after that nonce word. Here's the rule based on the given examples:

- After ""lug"" followed by ""walm"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- After ""dax"" followed by ""walm"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated twice, equal to the number of instances of ""walm"" in that sequence.

- ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"". From the first example, we know that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the new word ""wif"" corresponds to red, which is repeated twice due to ""bluf"".
- ""dax bluf wif"" results in ""green green red"". In this case, ""dax"" must correspond to green, and it's repeated twice because of ""bluf""; the following ""wif"" corresponds to red, but it's not doubled.
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow green blue"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, which is repeated due to ""bluf"", and then the colors corresponding to ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue) follow without being doubled.

- ""lug wif walm"" -> blue red red red (the word ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" repeats it three times)
- ""zup wif walm"" -> yellow red red red (the word ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" repeats it three times)
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue (the word ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""walm"" repeats it three times, then yellow is for ""zup,"" followed by ""lug"" and its three blue repeats)
- ""zup walm dax lug"" -> yellow yellow yellow green blue (the word ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""walm"" repeats it three times, then green for ""dax"" followed by blue for ""lug"")
- ""wif walm zup"" -> red red red yellow (the word ""wif"" is associated with red, ""walm"" repeats it three times, followed by yellow for ""zup"")

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> When preceding a color, it causes that color to be repeated three more times.",-0.09625825795670588,103,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can start by comparing the inputs and outputs to identify how the word ""walm"" is translated into a color in the output. Let's analyze the examples:

1. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red""
2. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red""
3. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
5. ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow""

Looking at the examples, ""walm"" appears to double the color word that precedes it:

1. ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
2. ""zup"" (yellow) preceded ""walm"", and ""yellow"" is repeated three times after it.
3. In ""lug walm zup lug walm"", ""lug"" (blue) is before both occurrences of ""walm"", causing ""blue"" to appear three times in a row after each ""walm"".
4. ""zup"" (yellow) before ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being tripled, and ""dax"" is not directly before ""walm"", so it remains a single green.
5. ""wif"" (red) is directly before ""walm"", hence ""red"" appears three times in a row, and ""zup"" (yellow) stands alone, so it appears only once.

So we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Triplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it. If no color is associated with the preceding word, ""walm"" does not apply the rule and the colors of the unrelated words appear as they are.",-0.10656748456064707,103,walm
"Analyzing the provided input-output pairs, we can try to discern the rule for the word ""walm"":

1. Input: lug wif walm | Output: blue red red red
2. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
3. Input: lug walm zup lug walm | Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
4. Input: zup walm dax lug | Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. Input: wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow

Observations:

- Every time the word ""walm"" is used, it leads to a repetition of the previous color word, particularly ""red"" in the examples 1, 2, and 5 where it comes after ""wif."" In examples 3 and 4, ""walm"" precedes colors other than red, and produces a sequence of the color that precedes it, which are ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.
  
- In example 3, ""walm"" is used twice and each time it results in three additional occurrences of the color that directly precedes it.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is in the middle and is followed by a different color word ""zup,"" which results in yellow, and it repeated the ""red"" preceding it twice.

Rule:

Walm -> Replicates the preceding color word three times.

So, ""walm"" seems to function as a repetition command for the prior color mentioned, causing it to be repeated three times.",-0.12015910359152943,103,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word appears to consistently translate to a specific color. The other nonce words also appear to correspond to colors as follows:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" appears only once, but in that instance translates to ""green""

The nonce word ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. In every example where ""walm"" appears, its effect is to repeat the color of the previous word three additional times (for a total of four instances of the same color). Observe the following patterns:

1. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
- ""lug"" is ""blue""
- ""wif"" is ""red""
- ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three more times

2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
- ""zup"" is ""yellow""
- ""wif"" is ""red""
- ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three more times

3. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
- ""lug"" is ""blue""
- ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times
- ""zup"" is ""yellow""
- ""lug"" is ""blue""
- ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times

4. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
- ""zup"" is ""yellow""
- ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times
- ""dax"" is ""green""
- ""lug"" is ""blue""

5. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
- ""wif"" is ""red""
- ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times
- ""zup"" is ""yellow""

We can then infer the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to be repeated three additional times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is:
walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three additional times.",-0.1343445494807176,103,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the word that follows it three times. Here's how we can deduce the rule:

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- Similar patterns are found in the other examples where after ""walm,"" the color of the following word is repeated three times, as shown in ""lug walm zup lug walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" and ""wif walm zup"" becoming ""red red red yellow.""

4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" maps to ""green red red red blue yellow""
5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" maps to ""yellow red green green green blue""

From these examples, we can see that each word in the input has a corresponding color in the output, except for ""wif,"" which consistently translates to ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it, ""wif"" always results in ""red."" This suggests a simple direct translation, without any context-dependent rules.

1. ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red""
2. ""wif"" at the end of ""lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""red""
3. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
4. ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red""
5. ""zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red green""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red.",-1.1594234925574467,104,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine its usage in different contexts from the examples provided.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between its input occurrences and the corresponding output, and analyze what changes from example to example:

In the first example, ""wif lug walm,"" the output is ""red blue blue blue."" We can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""blue,"" it indicates repetition of the color that precedes it.

In the second example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the output ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"" suggests ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and this confirms the prior rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word: ""wif"" is ""red"" followed by two additional ""red,"" and after ""zup,"" we have two additional ""yellow.""

The third input, ""dax walm wif walm,"" with the output ""green green green red red red,"" supports this rule: ""walm"" after ""dax"" yields two more ""green,"" and ""walm"" after ""wif"" yields two more ""red.""

In the fourth input, ""dax walm lug,"" the pattern continues with ""green green green blue,"" where ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which produces two more instances of ""green.""

Lastly, in the fifth input, ""lug zup walm lug,"" the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Again, ""zup walm"" results in additional ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the prior rule.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word preceding it another two times. So the meaning of ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word two additional times.",-0.08808628715778019,104,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the correlation between the input and the output. Here's what we can deduce from the examples provided:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is multiple ""blue.""
   - Example: ""lug zup walm lug"" -> Output: ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   - Three ""blue"" follow ""walm.""

2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is multiple ""red.""
   - Example: ""wif lug walm"" -> Output: ""red blue blue blue.""
   - Three ""red"" follow ""walm.""

3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is multiple ""green.""
   - Example: ""dax walm lug"" -> Output: ""green green green blue.""

4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is before another ""walm,"" the additional ""walm"" outputs more ""red.""
   - Example: ""dax walm wif walm"" -> Output: ""green green green red red red.""

Looking at these patterns, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word. The count of repetitions seems to depend on the position of ""walm"" in the sequence or possibly the preceding word. Here's a possible breakdown:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green

When ""walm"" follows these words, multiple instances of the associated color follow. The rule is not complete, as we lack information on the exact number of repetitions, but we can generalize that ""walm"" causes repetition of the previously mentioned color. 

Given the consistent pattern, we can posit the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it multiple times in the output.

However, it's important to note that we lack information about how many times the repetition occurs and whether it's consistent or follows more specific rules. For example, it's not clear why there are three repetitions of ""green"" when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and before another ""walm,"" but also three repetitions of ""red"" when ""walm"" follows ""wif."" The examples provided don't offer a clear rule for the count of repetitions, but the repetition pattern itself is evident.",-0.5402884016351648,104,walm
"Based on the input-output pairs, we can observe that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the preceding word three additional times. Here's a breakdown of how ""walm"" works according to each example: 

- In the first example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" following it causes ""blue"" to be repeated three more times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" again is followed by ""walm"" leading to three additional ""blue"" outputs, and ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" leads to three more ""yellow"" outputs.
- In the third example, ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" brings about three more ""green"" outputs, and ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" leads to three more ""red"" outputs.
- The fourth example has ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" which once again results in three more ""green"" outputs.
- In the final example, ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" produces three additional ""blue"" outputs, and the next ""lug"" produces a single ""blue"" output without a subsequent ""walm"" to create repeats.

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the provided examples that correlate with the changing outputs. We'll examine each input that contains ""walm"" and compare the outputs.

Input 1: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output 1: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Input 2: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output 2: green green green red blue green green green

Input 3: lug zup walm lug
Output 3: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input 4: lug dax walm wif
Output 4: blue green green green red

Input 5: wif walm
Output 5: red red red

Looking at the outputs, these are the observations:

- After every instance of ""walm,"" the color in the output sequence is repeated from the previous color at least once.
- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""walm"" is followed by another word, and the respective color for that word is ""green,"" which is also repeated.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows the word ""zup,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated afterward.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

These observations suggest that ""walm"" causes the next color to repeat the color associated with the word just before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

If there is no preceding word (or if it's the first word in the sequence), then it could be assumed that the default color is red, as shown in example 5. To give a comprehensive rule that includes this case:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, repeat the output color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the first word, repeat the color red.",-0.08067627153808248,105,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with repeated colors. Here's the analysis of each line:

1. zup walm dax zup dax wif
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which produces ""yellow"" and before ""dax"" which produces ""green."" The output is three ""yellows"" after ""walm.""

2. dax walm wif lug dax walm
   - Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""walm"" is after ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated three times, it's then before ""wif"" and ""red"" is the next output. Another ""walm"" follows and there are three ""green"" again.

3. lug zup walm lug
   - Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""walm"" is between ""zup"" which is yellow and ""lug"" which is blue. After ""walm"" we have three ""yellow.""

4. lug dax walm wif
   - Output: blue green green green red
   - ""walm"" is between ""dax"" which is green and ""wif"" which is red, and there are three ""green"" in the output.

5. wif walm
   - Output: red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated.

Looking at these rules, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color that comes before it three times. Therefore: 

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.",-0.08179309334001032,105,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and its output.

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

In this example, ""walm"" is followed by the output ""yellow green."" Given that ""zup"" before ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" and ""dax"" after ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" it seems that ""walm"" could represent a repetition of the previous color followed by the subsequent color's inversion (yellow - green inversion is yellow to green).

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

In this example, ""walm"" is first followed by ""green red"" and then by ""green green."" In the first case, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and in the second case, ""dax"" also translates to ""green."" This suggests that ""walm"" should involve ""green,"" yet the output differs. Notably, ""wif"" follows ""walm"" the first time, translating to ""red,"" and ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" the second time, translating to ""blue."" It is possible that ""walm"" repeats the color before it and the color of the word following it.

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

In this example, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue), but the output is ""yellow yellow."" The pattern of repetition of the previous color before inversion doesn't fully apply here since we are seeing two yellows.

4. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

Here, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), and the output is ""green green,"" which again could be interpreted as the repetition of the color before it, but not the inversion.

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

In this example, ""walm"" is only preceded by ""wif,"" which is red, and the output is ""red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" might be replicating the color of the word before it.

Based on the observations, the most consistent pattern seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the output color of the word before it. There is less consistency regarding what happens after ""walm,"" so it's difficult to deduce a rule for that without more context or examples. However, if we focus on the most consistent aspect of ""walm,"" we can hypothesize the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that precedes it in the sequence. If ""walm"" is at the beginning, it repeats its own color output (as seen in the last example).",-0.09777166321618556,105,walm
"Based on the patterns observed in the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the color that comes before it, causing the repetition of that color for the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.

We can see that when ""walm"" appears after a color like ""zup"" (which corresponds to the color yellow), ""dax"" (which corresponds to the color green), or ""lug"" (which corresponds to the color blue), that same color is repeated once for each occurrence of ""walm"". When ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" (which corresponds to the color red), ""red"" is also repeated.

Rule:
walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat its corresponding color once more.

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the preceding color word's corresponding color.",-0.9131302562350518,105,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the examples and see what is common across them when it comes to the output related to the word ""walm.""

In each example, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition in the output color of the word immediately preceding ""walm."" So, based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output. 

Thus, we can write:

Reviewing the outputs, we can observe that the color ""red"" is repeated after ""walm"" in each instance where ""walm"" appears:

5. Input: lug wif walm

Every instance of ""walm"" is followed by three instances of the color ""red"" in the generated output sequence. The word preceding ""walm"" does not appear to affect this pattern, nor does the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> Emit ""red"" three times sequentially in the output whenever it appears in the input.",-0.0747747666102234,106,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond with a sequence of colors in the output. Analyzing the patterns, it appears that ""walm"" results in repeating the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" in the input. To confirm this hypothesis, one can look at each example:

1. In the sequence ""dax zup wif lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and it is immediately followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""blue blue blue"" in the output.
   
2. In the sequence ""lug zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and it is immediately followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output.

3. In the sequence ""zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and it is immediately followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""green green green"" in the output.

4. In the sequence ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and it is immediately followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""green green green"" in the output.

5. In the sequence ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and it is immediately followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""red red red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes right before it, and it repeats thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-0.7064543824436168,106,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" correlates with the color ""red"" being repeated consecutively. 

However, the number of times ""red"" is repeated seems to depend on the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". In the examples, the word before ""walm"" was repeated the same number of times as the word ""red"" is in the output. 

Therefore the rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used, it means repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence as many times as the previous word is found in the input up to the point of ""walm"".

Examples to illustrate the rule:

- Example 1: ""wif walm"" is followed by ""red red red"" since ""wif"" occurs three times before ""walm"".
- Example 2: ""zup walm"" is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow"" since ""zup"" occurs once before ""walm"" and the color yellow is repeated for each occurrence of ""zup"".
- Example 3: ""dax walm"" is followed by ""green green green"" since ""dax"" occurs once before ""walm"" and the color green is repeated for each occurrence of ""dax"".
- Example 4: ""lug wif walm"" is followed by ""blue red red red"" since ""wif"" occurs once before ""walm"" and thus the color red associated with ""wif"" is repeated once.

4. In the instance of ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to the three reds.

- In the last two examples, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green"" and ""zup lug bluf"" to ""yellow blue blue"". Since we've inferred from previous examples that ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"", it would seem that ""bluf"" repeats the colour of the word immediately preceding it.

"To deduce the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" observe the outcomes associated with it in various contexts from the provided examples:

5. When ""dax walm wif zup"" is presented, the output is ""green green green red yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" corresponds to two instances of ""green.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that precedes it, meaning the color associated with the word right before ""walm,"" two or three times, depending on the context.

Formulating the rule, we can infer that:
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it results in three repetitions of the color associated with ""wif"" (the color ""red"").
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in two repetitions of the color associated with ""lug"" (the color ""blue"").
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in two repetitions of the color associated with ""dax"" (the color ""green"").

However, the current examples are not entirely consistent, as ""lug walm"" leads to two instances of the color blue, but ""lug wif walm"" leads to three instances of the color red. To be sure, additional context would be necessary.

Given the above inconsistencies, the safest induction from the provided examples without further context would be:

"Based on the provided examples, we can see a pattern of repetition associated with the nonce word ""walm."" In every output where ""walm"" is present, there is a sequence of the same color that corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is preceded by another word. To further illustrate:

- ""wif lug walm"" -> Output is ""red blue blue blue,"" ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" -> Output is ""red red red,"" there is only ""wif"" before ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug wif walm"" -> Output is ""blue red red red,"" there are two words before ""walm,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> Output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" ""walm"" is after the first ""lug,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated thrice, then it follows the pattern with other words.
- ""dax walm wif zup"" -> Output is ""green green green red yellow,"" ""walm"" is after ""dax,"" and thus ""green"" is repeated three times, then the pattern follows with the other words.

The rule seems to be:

Rule: the word following ""walm"" in the input dictates the color that should be repeated. The amount of repetition is equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input.

1. When ""wif lug walm"" is input, the output is four colors with ""blue"" repeated three times following ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to multiple occurrences of the color that precedes it.

2. The input ""wif walm"" results in three ""red"" colors, which aligns with the earlier deduction that ""walm"" results in repetitions of the preceding color.

3. Similarly, ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times after ""blue.""

4. The input ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" provides a sequence where ""blue"" is repeated three times after the initial ""blue,"" followed by alternating ""red"" and ""blue.""

5. Finally, ""dax walm wif zup"" results in ""green"" being repeated twice before changing to ""red"" with the introduction of ""wif."" The sequence ends with ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

Other words in the sequence, like ""dax"" and ""zup"" seem to translate to other colors; ""dax"" may translate to ""green"" and ""zup"" may translate to ""yellow"". Additionally, ""bluf"" and ""walm"" are associated with the color ""red"" after they follow in the sequence, suggesting that they could produce repeated ""red"" outputs or that repetitions in output colors can occur with certain inputs. The word ""wif"" does not seem to change its output based on position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red",-0.7400909972472223,109,wif

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when followed by ""wif"" (seen in the second example).
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when followed by ""wif"" (seen in the fourth example).
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" or ""zup"" (second and last examples).
- ""walm"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" (in the last example).

One tricky part is parsing ""bluf"", which might depend on previous words since ""bluf"" appears twice in the last example, translating both to ""yellow"" and ""red"", though it appears to become ""red"" when following ""wif"".

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output: green red green yellow yellow
- Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. Hence, the first instance of ""bluf"" is yellow.

Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red
- ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. Therefore, ""bluf"" is green in this instance.

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
- The first ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, making the first ""bluf"" blue.
- The second ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" corresponding to yellow, making the second ""bluf"" yellow.

Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- ""Bluf"" is again following ""zup,"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" becomes yellow.

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
- ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, therefore ""bluf"" is green here.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is used to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. It functions similarly to a ""repeat"" command in a sequence of instructions, where ""bluf"" indicates that the color that came before it should be repeated. Let's look at the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again, and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""

"Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color preceding it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", and results in three repetitions of ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" results in ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"", where ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" (yellow) and results in three ""yellow"" before ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"", where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), resulting in two more ""blue"" colors echoing the first one.
- The pattern is reaffirmed with ""zup walm wif"", yielding ""yellow yellow yellow red"", with ""walm"" creating three ""yellow"" after the initial ""zup"" (yellow).
- Finally, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"", where ""walm"" again results in three repetitions of the preceding color, which is ""blue"" from ""lug"".

Thus: walm -> three repetitions of the color preceding it.",-0.10231322502606743,109,walm
"Based on the input and output patterns provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color related to the previous word. Each nonce word aside from ""walm"" appears to translate consistently to a color:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

Whenever ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears plus one (including the original appearance of that color).

So, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word. The total count includes the original appearance of that color, plus one repetition for each occurrence of ""walm"".

For example:
- ""lug walm"" output ""blue blue blue"" suggests that ""walm"" repeats the previous color ""blue"" two times (total of 3 blue including the initial ""lug"" blue).
- ""zup walm wif"" output ""yellow yellow yellow red"" suggests that ""walm"" repeats the previous color ""yellow"" two times before moving on to the next color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red"".",-0.8368324913438203,109,walm

The word 'walm' appears to be affecting the output in a uniform way. Across the examples, whenever 'walm' appears, the output is a repetition of the last color mentioned before 'walm', and the number of repetitions is equal to the number of times 'walm' appears consecutively.

For instance:
- In the first example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and after 'walm', 'blue' is repeated once followed by 'red'.
- In the second example, 'wif' is 'red', and after 'walm', 'red' is repeated three times.
- In the third example, 'lug' is 'blue', and after the first 'walm', 'blue' is repeated once, and after the second 'walm', 'red' is repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, only 'wif' is provided before 'walm', which is 'red', and then 'red' is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, 'zup lug' corresponds to 'yellow blue', and after 'walm', 'green' is repeated three times, and after the last 'walm', 'blue' is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it causes the color before it to repeat an additional number of times, equal to the number of consecutive occurrences of 'walm' plus one more repetition. Also, if 'walm' is the last word in the sequence, then the repetition is followed by the color 'red'.

In case 2, ""dax"" comes after ""bluf,"" which translates to ""yellow"" twice, and once more the output is ""green."" In case 3, ""dax"" is between two instances of ""bluf,"" and the output is ""green"" in the corresponding position. Finally, in case 5, ""dax"" is at the end after ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and is followed by ""green.""

From these observations, we can deduce that regardless of the words that come before or after ""dax,"" the output is consistently ""green."" Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green.""

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should examine how the word is used in relation to the output colors. Across the provided examples, observe how the color sequence changes before and after ""walm"" is included.

From the first input-output pair:
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red.""

It appears that every time ""walm"" is included, we see a sequence of ""red"" colors in the output that follows ""walm."" Let's apply this observation to the other examples.

From the second input-output pair:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
Here, there is no preceding color to look at (as ""lug"" is the first word), but ""walm"" itself generates a sequence of ""blue"" in the output.

From the third input-output pair:
- ""dax zup walm wif"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red.""
Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow red."" Notice that ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" and then a ""red.""

From the fourth input-output pair:
- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red.""
In this example, following ""walm"" with another ""walm"" seems to add more ""red"" colors.

From the fifth input-output pair:
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
Again, ""walm"" is followed by multiple ""red"" colors.

The rule that can explain all of these examples is that ""walm"" duplicates the next color that would have been outputted if ""walm"" was not present, and it does so three times. 

However, it is important to note a discrepancy in data: in the third and fourth examples, the repeated sequences are ""yellow yellow yellow red"" and ""red red red,"" which may indicate that ""walm"" could be about repeating the output from the preceding word(s) or the next word with the exception where the color should have been ""blue"" after ""lug"", but instead, we see ""blue blue blue"". There's an assumption that ""wif"" generates ""red"" and ""lug"" generates ""blue,"" but ""dax"" and ""zup"" each generate ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

So there is an inconsistency because ""lug"" alone generates one ""blue"" while ""lug walm"" generates three ""blue."" Because the latter sequence doesn't follow the duplication of ""blue"" color, but instead the triplication, without additional context, we may conclude that walm could mean ""repeat the next color three times,"" with a special rule for ""blue"" after ""lug,"" where it also repeats three times instead of duplicating.

Rule: walm -> repeat the next color three times (with an irregularity potentially occurring with the color blue after ""lug"").",-0.08723842060430205,111,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to increase the output of the preceding color by two additional instances. To illustrate, when walm follows any color word (e.g., wif, lug, or dax), the output color associated with that word is produced three times instead of once. It overrides the standard one-to-one correspondence between the input and the output. Here is the rule following the format you requested:

Rule: walm -> After any color word, repeat that color's output two more times (for a total of three).

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" indicating that the single occurrence of ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is tripled.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" confirming the rule with ""lug"" (blue).
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax zup walm wif"" and ""dax zup walm wif walm"" show that ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red) are each tripled in the presence of ""walm.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif walm"" again results in ""red red red,"" which fits with the established pattern.

Therefore:
walm -> After any color word, repeat that color's output two more times (for a total of three).",-0.8127065306556253,111,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns before and after each occurrence of ""walm"":

1. In the first example, every ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" leads to ""blue."" Therefore, ""walm"" does not seem to change the color associated with ""lug.""
   
2. In the second example, only ""lug walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" might be adding repetitions of the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).

3. In the third example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" ""wif"" gives ""red."" In the previous examples, ""wif"" was consistently associated with ""red."" However, the presence of ""walm"" creates two additional ""yellow"" which are associated with ""zup.""

4. In the fourth example, the sequence repeats much like in the third example, but after the second ""walm,"" there are three additional ""red,"" correlating with the appearance of ""wif.""

5. In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" again is causing the repetition of the color associated with the word prior to it.

Based on these observations:

1. ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears just before it.
2. The number of repetitions (including the original) either equals the total instances of ""walm"" in the statement plus one, or simply the total instances of the preceding word plus one.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the word directly preceding it to be repeated in the output the number of times that word has appeared so far (including that instance).

Rule: walm -> induces repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, the number of occurrences equivalent to the number of instances the preceding word has appeared so far.",-0.8244422533458332,111,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided with their corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following patterns for the nonce word ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" occurs after a color word (e.g., ""wif"" for red, ""lug"" for blue, ""dax"" for green), it results in a repetition of the output color for that word, extended by one additional repetition. For instance, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" instead of just ""red red"".
  
- When ""walm"" is preceded by a non-color word (""zup"" has no direct color association), it seems to result in a repetition of the color of the preceding actual color word. For instance, ""dax zup walm wif"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" indicating that ""walm"" extended the yellow associated with ""zup,"" though ""zup"" does not directly equate to a color by itself.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as follows:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color of the previous color-associated word, with one additional repetition beyond what was already there.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a color-associated word (A) and its corresponding output color (a), it causes a sequence of ""a"" repeated once more than the color's usual amount. If ""walm"" follows a non-color word that follows a color-associated word, it takes the color of the preceding color-associated word and causes it to repeat in a similar manner.",-0.8929326615395827,111,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" is related to the color red, and that a certain number of repetitions are based on the presence of ""walm"" and the preceding word. By examining the input and output pairs, we can induce the following:

- If ""wif"" comes right before ""walm"", the output has three reds (""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"").
- If ""lug"" comes right before ""walm"", the output has three blues (""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"").
- If ""dax zup"" comes right before ""walm"", it outputs a yellow followed by two reds (""dax zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red"").
- Additionally, if ""wif"" comes after ""dax zup walm"", we add one red for ""wif"" (""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red"").

Since the rule needs to consider the preceding word(s), it can be complex. The challenge lies in deducing a common rule that fits all of the examples given by considering just ""walm"".

From the third and fourth examples, we see that when ""walm"" follows ""dax zup"", there are two yellows and then reds, but when ""wif"" is added after ""walm"", there are extra reds equal to the number of ""wif"" following ""walm"". 

The rule could possibly be: When ""walm"" is present, it takes the color associated with the previous word or phrase and repeats it a certain number of times depending on the context or the words following ""walm"".

However, since ""wif"" is associated with red and only one red is output when ""wif"" stands alone, while three reds are output for ""wif walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" means more than just repetition. It multiplies or amplifies the output color of the preceding word.

Given the inputs and outputs, for the most consistent and simple rule, we can assume:

In Example 2, ""zup"" appears first and the output starts with yellow. When ""zup"" appears again after ""lug,"" the sequence is reset to yellow again, meaning that ""zup"" resets the color sequence to start with yellow, and then the following words determine the next colors.

In Example 3, the output is yellow after each occurrence of ""zup,"" indicating another reset of the sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""zup"" resets the output sequence to start with yellow, followed by a pattern defined by the following words in the input.

So, zup -> meaning. Meaning is: Resets the output color sequence to start with yellow.",-0.0775547349072093,112,zup

- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> (not explicitly stated, but assuming no typos, it correlates with the output ""yellow"" which seems inconsistent unless 'bluf' is an erroneous input, and no color can be inferred from this single instance)
- dax -> green

Now, let's determine what ""zup"" represents. To understand the pattern, we'll look at where ""zup"" appears and what color follows in the output:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" yellow is repeated thrice in the output.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" blue appears in the output.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" red appears in the output.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" green appears in the output.

However, when ""zup"" stands alone or precedes another ""zup,"" the color yellow appears in the output. This suggests that ""zup"" may serve as a modifier that changes the output based on its position and context:

1. When ""zup"" occurs before a color word, it doesn't affect the output color for that word (the color follows as if ""zup"" wasn't there).
2. When ""zup"" follows a color word or precedes ""zup,"" it generates the color yellow.
3. When ""zup"" is at the start of the sequence before a color word, it seems to be functioning as a color word itself, resulting in yellow.

With this in mind, we can infer the following rule for ""zup"":

**Rule**: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when it is either at the start of a sequence, when it precedes or follows another ""zup,"" or when it stands alone. When ""zup"" precedes another color word, it does not affect the output for that particular color word.",-0.9795789929767442,112,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can derive the following observations:

1. Whenever ""zup"" is present, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
2. The number of ""yellow"" in the output is equal to the number of times that ""zup"" appears in the input plus one.
3. Other words preceding or following ""zup"" correspond to different colors in the output.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to no direct match, but could speculate to blue with a typo or another color with a coincidence.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" being output once more than the number of times ""zup"" appears in the input. Hence, after each occurrence of ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is printed, and there is one additional ""yellow"" at the end of the sequence which does not correspond to any particular word in the input.

2. When 'bluf' is at the end of the sequence or is immediately followed by 'zup', there is no direct corresponding color for it in the output.

Given this information, 'bluf' likely indicates that we should repeat the last color, unless it is directly followed by 'zup', in which case it indicates that no new color should be added.

Applying this rule to the examples:

- In ""lug wif bluf"", 'bluf' follows 'wif', so it repeats ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf wif"", 'bluf' is not followed by a color, thus it adds no new color but the pattern ""yellow yellow"" suggests that 'bluf' after 'zup' results in a repetition of ""yellow"".
- In ""zup bluf lug"", 'bluf' repeats the ""yellow"" from before and is followed by ‘lug’ which translates to ""blue"".
- In ""zup bluf"", 'bluf' follows 'zup' and it does not add a new color, sticking with ""yellow yellow"".
- In ""lug wif bluf lug wif"", 'bluf' follows 'wif' and repeats ""red"", and then the pattern continues after it with ""blue red"" as per 'lug' and 'wif'.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' means to repeat the previous color, but if it follows 'zup' or is at the end of a sequence, no new color is to be added.

Rule:
bluf -> repeat the last mentioned color (or add no new color when following 'zup' or at the end)",-0.27624914802672595,112,bluf
"Each example seems to involve a translation of individual words into colors. Let's analyze the patterns:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" based on the first and last examples.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" based on the first and last examples.
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" based on the second and third examples.

The word ""bluf"" is present in all examples, and when it is present, it leads to outputs with one less color than the number of input words. It seems to act as a delimiter or a ""do not output"" signal for the word immediately following it. When ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""wif"", there is no ""red"" output (there are two instances of this occurrence). When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", there is no ""blue"" output, as noted in the third example. When ""bluf"" is the last word, the output contains one less ""yellow"" than the number of ""zup"" words in the input.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it cancels or removes the color associated with the word that immediately follows it from the output.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which yields ""yellow."" As such, ""walm"" generates two additional ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""zup walm dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which yields ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" corresponding to ""red,"" and ""walm"" outputs two more ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and results in ""walm"" producing two more ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" the output is ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" We can see two instances of ""walm"" here. The first is after ""lug"" (blue), which results in two more ""blue,"" and the second is after ""zup"" (yellow), producing two additional ""yellow.""

"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that 'walm' means repeating the color word that appears immediately before it, the number of times equal to the length of the word that precedes the 'walm'.

Here’s the breakdown:

In example 1:
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
'Walm' is preceded by 'zup', which has three letters, so 'walm' translates to 'yellow' repeated three times.
  
In example 2:
- ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""
'Walm' is preceded by 'zup', a three-letter word, resulting in 'yellow' being repeated three times.

In example 3:
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
'Walm' is preceded by 'wif', a three-letter word, thus 'walm' corresponds to 'red' repeated three times.

In example 4:
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
'Walm' is preceded by 'lug', a three-letter word, leading to 'walm' meaning 'blue' repeated three times.

In example 5:
- ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red""
The first 'walm' is preceded by 'lug' (three letters), so it translates to 'blue' repeated three times.

1. In the first example, the word after ""walm"" is omitted but the pattern is yellow, which corresponds to the word ""zup"".
2. In the second example, the pattern after ""walm"" is green, which corresponds to the word ""dax"".
3. In the third example, the pattern after ""walm"" is red, repeated three times, corresponding to the word ""wif"".

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by both ""zup"" (resulting in three yellows) and ""wif"" (resulting in a single red color).

From these observations, it can be deduced that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated. The number of times the color is repeated appears to be based on the word that follows ""walm"".

- In the first example (lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue), the only difference between ""lug"" and ""bluf"" translating to ""blue"" seems to be their position.

- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"", which is the same translation as ""wif"".

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and translates to ""yellow"", which is the color translated from ""zup"". So, it seems like ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it.

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", which has been translated to ""green"", and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"". This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

"From examining the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" has an effect on the output based on its placement relative to other words and possibly the word it follows.

Let's analyze the word ""walm"" in each input and the corresponding outputs:

1. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   After ""lug"" and before ""zup"" walm produces three ""blue"". After ""lug"" at the end, walm produces two additional ""blue"". The presence of ""zup"" in between seems to result in only one ""yellow"" despite breaking the sequence of walm-related outputs.

2. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" after ""zup"" results in three ""yellow"". After ""wif"" it produces three ""red"".

3. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green

4. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
   ""Walm"" after ""dax"" again leads to three ""green"".

5. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
   ""Walm"" after ""dax"" once more results in three ""green"". The presence of ""zup"" before ""wif"" does not seem to affect the sequence.

From this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" results in a repeated output color based on the prior word before ""walm"". Here are the observed patterns:

- After ""lug"", walm results in repeated ""blue"".
- After ""dax"", walm results in repeated ""green"".
- After ""zup"", walm results in three ""yellow"".
- After ""wif"", walm results in repeated ""red"".

Counting the repetitions, it seems that ""walm"" typically results in a threefold repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it, with the output sequence being uninterrupted if followed by ""walm"" again. ""Zup"" seems to interrupt these sequences, but it only results in one color output when directly followed by ""walm"", not an interruption of the threefold pattern.

Rule: walm -> When following a word, ""walm"" produces three consecutive outputs that correspond to the color associated with the preceding word. If ""walm"" follows ""zup"", it results in three ""yellow"" outputs. The consecutive output can be interrupted by the presence of ""zup"".",-0.08273705779384317,113,walm
"To deduce the rule for ""walm,"" let's examine the color output in relation to the position of ""walm"" in the inputs.

- In every instance, ""walm"" corresponds to a series of three colors in the output.
- The series of three colors appears to be the same for each individual instance of ""walm.""

The series of colors before and after ""walm"" should be considered for consistent patterns. All other words in the input correspond to a single-colored output, but ""walm"" consistently corresponds to three colors.

Analyzing each case:

1. lug walm zup lug walm
   - The ""walm"" outputs are ""blue blue blue"" and ""blue blue blue.""
   
2. dax zup walm wif walm
   - The ""walm"" outputs are ""green green green"" and ""red red red.""

3. zup dax walm
   - The ""walm"" output is ""green green green.""

4. zup wif dax walm lug
   - The ""walm"" output is ""green green green.""

5. zup dax walm zup wif
   - The ""walm"" output is ""green green green.""

From this, we can see that ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word directly preceding it and repeats it three times. 

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

"Based on the given examples, we can try to infer the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup"". To do this, we can look at the positioning and repetition of inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when followed by ""lug wif dax bluf wif"".
2. In the second example, ""zup"" alone causes the repetition of ""yellow"" three times when flanked by ""walm"" which corresponds to ""blue"" in a repeated manner.
3. In the third example, ""zup"" repeatedly corresponds to ""yellow"" and alternates with ""lug"" which consistently corresponds to ""blue"", and it ends with ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"".
4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" leads to a double ""yellow"" when it follows ""dax wif"" and is followed by ""bluf wif walm"", where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (repeated) and ""dax"" to ""green"".
5. In the fifth example, following ""dax bluf"", ""zup"" results in a single ""yellow"".

From these examples, it seems like:

- When ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to ""yellow"".
- The word before ""zup"" does not affect its output.
- The word after ""zup"" does not seem to affect its output, but there is a repeated color for ""wif"" and ""bluf"" after ""zup"" which corresponds to red and green respectively.
- The presence of ""zup"" does not seem to cause the preceding color word to repeat like the word ""walm"" does.

Considering all these observations, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"", regardless of its position or the context given by surrounding words. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.9349045870524002,114,zup
"Based on the given examples, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""

Let's analyze the examples provided:

- In every instance where the word ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- ""Zup"" occurs one or more times in the input, and each time, a corresponding ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.
- Other words like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" are consistently associated with other colors (blue, green, etc.), independent of their position or the presence of ""zup.""

Here's how the rule applies to each given input example:

- When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the word ""red"" is repeated three times in the output.
- When no other word follows ""walm,"" as seen in the fifth example, the word ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.

From this pattern, it appears that the term ""walm"" indicates a rule to repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm."" When no word follows ""walm,"" the default is to repeat the color for ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color word corresponding to the previous word three times. If there is no word after ""walm,"" repeat the color corresponding to the word ""dax"" three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from these examples, let's examine the patterns.

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue""; ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue"" based on other examples.
- In the second example, ""wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow""; ""zup"" typically corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red green""; we can match ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green red blue red""; we again see a correspondence between ""lug"" and ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green"", showing ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".

In all instances where ""walm"" appears, the word immediately before it affects the output. The output for ""walm"" repeats the corresponding color of the word before it three times. Therefore, ""walm"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and triples its occurrence.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern preceding and following it in the given examples, alongside the output colors.

Here's the analysis:

- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
- ""lug walm zup"" -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""wif walm zup walm"" -> Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax wif walm"" -> Output: green red red red
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

From the examples above, we can deduce the following:

1. Every time the word ""walm"" appears, the color before it changes.
2. ""zup"" always follows ""walm"" and then the output is yellow.
3. When ""walm"" is present, the color changes, and for every unique word before ""walm,"" the corresponding color is repeated three times before it changes to yellow.
4. When ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug"" appear before ""walm,"" the corresponding colors are green, red, and blue respectively, and these colors are repeated thrice.
5. When ""walm"" appears twice, the pattern repeats after the yellow.

Using the patterns, we can infer that ""walm"" is a transforming function that changes the following:

- It repeats the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.
- It then changes the output to yellow, regardless of the previous color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word thrice, then change to yellow.",-0.10723744569451611,116,walm
"To figure out the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns and corresponding outputs:

1. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
2. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
3. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
4. dax wif walm -> green red red red
5. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

From these examples, we can deduce the following:

- Prior to the occurrence of ""walm,"" the outputs are a series of colors that repeat corresponding to each input word. 
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- After the occurrence of ""walm,"" the patterns change.

- In example 2, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In example 3, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated three times. When ""walm"" appears the second time, ""yellow"" is presented twice after ""zup"".

- Regardless of the word following ""dax,"" the output is green for every occurrence of ""dax.""

Now let us examine the implications of ""dax"" when it's followed by different words:

1. In the first example, ""dax zup dax"" maps to ""green yellow green."" Since both instances of ""dax"" map to ""green,"" it suggests ""dax"" maps to ""green"" independently of the context.

2. In the second example, ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" maps to ""green red green yellow yellow."" Again, both ""dax"" map to ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" directly corresponds to ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""dax lug bluf wif"" maps to ""green blue blue red."" The word ""dax"" at the beginning maps to ""green,"" so the context of following words does not seem to affect the output for ""dax.""

4. The fourth example ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green."" Here, we don't know the individual meaning of ""walm,"" but we can see that ""dax"" still results in ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" maps to ""yellow red green green green blue."" Even when ""dax"" is preceded by different nonce words (in this case, ""zup wif""), the output immediately following ""dax"" is ""green,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these observations, we can induce that the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green,"" irrespective of the position or surrounding context within the string.

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.08463393187802323,117,dax
"Based on the examples given, we can observe that the output color changes with different input words surrounding ""dax."" We need to determine the consistency behind the use of ""dax"" to deduce its meaning.

Let's examine the context in which ""dax"" appears:
1. When ""dax"" appears alone, as in ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" This could suggest that ""dax"" refers to ""green,"" and ""walm"" might replicate the color before it.
2. In ""dax zup dax,"" the output is ""green yellow green,"" which supports the idea that ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" with ""zup"" introducing ""yellow.""
3. In ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green red green yellow yellow."" Here, the presence of ""dax"" continues to result in ""green,"" and ""wif"" seems to introduce ""red,"" while ""bluf"" might either introduce ""yellow"" directly or simply repeat the previous color, which in this case is ""yellow.""
4. The sequence ""dax lug bluf wif"" producing ""green blue blue red"" possibly reaffirms that ""dax"" is ""green"" and introduces the notion that ""lug"" might mean ""blue,"" with ""bluf"" again producing the same color that immediately precedes it.
5. Finally, in ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red green green green blue."" Here, the color sequence appears to support previous conjectures about ""dax"" being ""green"" and ""walm"" repeating the color before it (in this case ""green""), with ""lug"" closing with ""blue.""

Therefore, it seems the most consistent rule from these examples is that ""dax"" always results in the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of the other words.

"Based on the examples given, ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"" every time it appears. The term does not seem to change meaning based on position in the sequence or the surrounding words. So, the rule is consistent whenever ""dax"" is present regardless of the context.

Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. Additionally, it seems that ""wif"" does not alter the translation of the words that follow it to their respective colors.

Here is the analysis for each example:

1. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to a sequence of ""red"" but we need more examples to confirm its exact meaning.

3. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems to still correspond to ""red red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

5. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems to consistently correspond to ""red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Based on this analysis, we can formulate the rule as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.09357215139000001,117,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following patterns:

- When “wif” is followed by ""dax"", the output is ""red green"".
- When “wif” is followed by ""zup"", the output is ""red yellow"".
- When “wif” is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
- When “wif” is by itself, the output is ""red"".
- At the beginning of a sequence, ""wif"" leads to ""red"" as the first output color, followed by the same pattern for the rest of the words.

Now, let's look for a general rule. One thing to note is that ""wif"" always results in ""red"" as its first corresponding output color. The following colors seem to depend on the word that comes after ""wif"". When ""wif"" precedes another word, it dictates a pattern for that following word, overriding what would be the normal output for that word.

For instance:
- ""dax"" normally corresponds with ""green,"" but when preceded by ""wif,"" it corresponds with ""red green.""
- ""zup"" normally corresponds with ""yellow,"" but when preceded by ""wif,"" it corresponds with ""red yellow.""
- ""walm"" doesn't appear on its own, but when preceded by ""wif,"" it corresponds with ""red red red."" 

The red might indicate a kind of reset or marker, but the continuation seems to adopt a pattern after the red where ""wif"" is affecting the output of the next word in sequence.

With this in mind, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"" followed by the normal output of the next word, but starting with ""red"" instead of its usual first color. If there is no subsequent word, the output consists only of ""red"". If ""wif"" proceeds ""walm"" it results in ""red"" being repeated three times. This last rule seems specific to this pair, as we don't have examples of ""walm"" without ""wif"", we can't compare it with a ""normal"" output.",-0.9378821576578312,117,wif

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"" and other words from the given examples, we can analyze the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

In every example where only ""zup"" appears as an input, the output is singular - ""yellow"". Therefore, the most straightforward deduction would be that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Next, we see that additional words in the string produce additional colors in the output. Following is an analysis to determine the corresponding colors:

1. ""lug"" seems to consistently result in the output ""blue.""
2. ""wif"" and ""walm"" both precede the same color ""red,"" but since ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue,"" it seems ""wif"" could mean ""repeat the next color twice,"" and ""walm"" then would be ""red.""
3. ""bluf"" appears once followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow blue,"" which suggests ""bluf"" possibly means ""yellow,"" as it precedes ""yellow's"" known output color from the ""zup"" input.
4. ""dax"" precedes the color ""green"" in the output.

Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green. When ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" the output is green. However, when ""bluf"" stands alone or is not immediately preceded by ""dax,"" it does not map to a consistent color in the output. Given that the sequences before ""bluf"" differ and sometimes include ""lug"" which maps to blue, ""wif"" which maps to red, and ""dax"" which maps to green, and considering their outputs, the contextual connection for ""bluf"" seems to uniquely affect the output directly after ""dax.""

So, from these examples, we can observe the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example, when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the resulting color is ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to be repeated three times. 

Let's analyze the examples to deduce the rule:

Output: green green green
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif

Here, the color associated with ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
In this sequence, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the corresponding color ""red"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

Input: dax walm

"Based on the outputs associated with the input phrases that include the nonce word ""walm,"" we can deduce that ""walm"" duplicates the color output of the immediately preceding word. In every case where ""walm"" follows another word, the color output of ""walm"" is identical to that of the word before it:

- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green,"" meaning that ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" that correlates with ""dax.""
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow green green green blue red,"" with ""walm"" duplicating the ""green"" from ""dax.""
- ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue,"" thus ""walm"" replicates the ""blue"" which is associated with ""lug.""
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" leads to ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" where ""walm"" again copies the color ""red"" from the preceding word ""wif.""
- The final example is the same as the first and confirms the rule with consistent output.

"Based on the input and output provided, the pattern suggests that ""walm"" leads to the word ""green"" being repeated a number of times corresponding to its position in the input sequence. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first and last examples, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" The word ""green"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" is the second word.
- In the second example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" produces ""yellow green green green blue red."" The word ""green"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" is the third word.
- In the third example, ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue."" The word ""blue"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" is the third word.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" leads to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Here, ""red"" is repeated six times and ""blue"" once because ""walm"" is the sixth word.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it translates to the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence, repeated a number of times equal to its position in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> The color of the previous word repeated as many times as its position in the input sequence.",-0.19308263869524178,117,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. In every instance, the word that comes just before ""walm"" is translated into a color, followed by that same color repeated two more times. For example:

- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""walm"" leads to ""green green"".
- In ""wif lug walm"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue"".

Taking this into consideration, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

From these observations, the rule for ""dax"" can be deduced as:

Rule: The word ""dax"" maps to the color ""green."" If ""dax"" appears before other words in a sequence, it seems to influence the following word(s) to also map to ""green.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" is green and potentially influences subsequent words to change their usual color mapping to green as well.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to the output ""green."" This indication remains steady regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

However, when looking at other words, there doesn't seem to be enough consistent usage to establish firm rules for them. For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" but it is not clear what the output would be if ""lug"" appeared alone or in a different context. Similarly, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"" but to ""green"" when it comes after ""dax"" or on its own with ""dax."" The rules governing these words are not explicitly clear from the given examples.

Given the data, I induce the following rule:

Rule:
dax -> green",-1.2414028976,118,dax
"Rule: 

Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever the input is ""dax"" on its own, the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is combined with ""lug walm,"" the output for ""dax"" is ""green"", and the output for ""walm"" following ""dax"" is a repetition of ""green."" Since ""walm"" on its own is represented as ""blue,"" it seems that ""dax"" changes the output of the following word to the same color as ""dax"" (in this case, green).
- When ""dax"" is not the first or the only word in the sequence, its output remains ""green"" regardless of its position.
- When ""dax"" is repeated after ""lug"" in the fourth input, ""lug"" retains its color indicated by ""blue,"" suggesting that ""dax"" does not affect words that precede it.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:

dax -> green, and when following ""dax,"" the immediately subsequent word takes on the same color as ""dax"" when it is the next word, that is ""green"" in this context. The effect of ""dax"" does not apply to words that precede it.",-1.275864994040625,118,dax

4. ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow""
5. ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow""

"Based on the examples provided, bluf appears at different positions within the inputs, and the output colors do not seem to align with a particular color consistently when bluf is used. However, observing the colors that follow the appearance of bluf in the output sequence can provide some insights into the potential rule of its meaning. Here is the analysis:

1. Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which results in two greens, suggesting that the position after ""dax"" might affect the color outcome when ""bluf"" is present, adding a green.
   
2. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" is at the end, which follows ""zup,"" and it results in yellow, similar to what ""zup"" generates.

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" when ""wif"" is after ""walm."" This results in two reds, suggesting that ""bluf"" might be amplifying the effect of ""wif"" here.

4. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""Bluf"" again occurs at the end. The position of ""bluf"" following ""zup"" keeps generating yellow, but it does not provide further insight.
   
5. Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - ""Bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" which might suggest that ""bluf"" could influence the color shift for ""dax"" to green.

Based on the above, we can extract the following potential rule:

Rule: ""Bluf"" may either modify the color outcome based on its position relative to the surrounding words or simply carry the color attribute of the word immediately preceding it when it is the last word. Given the inconsistency in resulting colors and the provided examples, it is difficult to assign a single, definitive meaning to ""bluf."" However, when it is not the last word, it seems to generate the green color, hinting at a potential relationship with preceding words (possibly ""dax""). When it is the last word, it appears to repeat the color of the word right before it.

Therefore, a tentative rule induction could be:
bluf -> meaning: When following ""dax"", contributes to a green color; when at the end of a sequence, repeats the color of the preceding word; otherwise, its influence is uncertain and may depend on different rules that are not clear from the given examples.",-0.1064689497695244,118,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the position of ""bluf"" in each input and the color of its corresponding output:

1. When ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence:
   - Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow (""bluf"" follows ""dax"")
   - Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow (""bluf"" is at the end)
   - Input: wif lug zup bluf | Output: red blue yellow yellow (""bluf"" is at the end)
   
   In these instances, ""bluf"" doesn't follow the same pattern of color output, suggesting its meaning might not be position-independent and perhaps could be dependent on the word it follows or other words in the sequence.

2. When ""bluf"" is not at the end of the sequence:
   - Input: dax walm wif bluf | Output: green green green red red (""bluf"" follows ""wif"")
   - Input: lug zup bluf dax | Output: blue yellow yellow green (""bluf"" precedes ""dax"")

   Here, ""bluf"" is red when following ""wif"" and yellow when before ""dax,"" further suggesting that its meaning depends on its position relative to other words.

Given that ""bluf"" leads to different colors when in different positions and in relation to different words, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" is a word that affects or is affected by its neighboring words. Unfortunately, with the given data, there isn't enough information to lock down a specific rule for ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" does not have a consistent meaning on its own; instead, its meaning or the color it is associated with in the output depends on its position in the sequence and the words around it. More examples would be needed to pin down a more precise rule.",-0.18498192625292675,118,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a varying output that does not match a single consistent color, which suggests that it does not translate to a static meaning. Instead, its output seems to depend on its position or possibly the words around it. 

Let's first note the consistent colors for the non-""bluf"" words:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> green (assuming from the third example since it's the only place it appears)

Now, let's look at the outputs for ""bluf"" based on its position:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup"", the output is yellow.
2. When ""bluf"" is at the end and follows ""zup"", the output is yellow.
3. When ""bluf"" is at the end and follows ""wif"", the output is yellow.
4. When ""bluf"" is at the end and follows ""lug"", the output is yellow.
5. When ""bluf"" follows ""walm"" and ""wif"", the output includes two reds.

Given these observations, a possible rule might be that ""bluf"" outputs one or more colors based on its position relative to other words or, perhaps more likely, based on the specific words that precede it. There is not enough consistent evidence to conclude that position alone determines the color. In example 5, ""bluf"" outputs two reds, indicating it might mirror the color of the word right before it when there are two identical colors in sequence (since ""wif"" before it is red as well).

However, without additional examples or a clear pattern emerging from these existing examples, it is difficult to determine a more precise rule. The rule for ""bluf"" might involve a more complex interaction with the preceding words than can be ascertained from these instances alone.

Rule: Since there is no conclusive pattern or consistent output/color for ""bluf"" across all examples, ""bluf"" might represent a variable or function whose value depends on the context, specifically the word or words immediately preceding it.",-0.7340122666654878,118,bluf
"Based on the examples, I will deduce the underlying rule for the word ""bluf.""

In each instance, ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green,"" and ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow."" Colors such as ""blue"" and ""red"" are also used but do not have consistent words associated with them across the given examples.

One thing consistent about ""bluf,"" though, is that it always changes the color output. The color before ""bluf"" differs after ""bluf"" is introduced. However, there is not enough information to directly assign a color to ""bluf."" It seems to cause the color sequence to shift or change. 

When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" ""green"" turns into ""yellow"" or ""red,"" suggesting a downgrade or shift away from ""green."" When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color sequence that ends in ""yellow"" switches to ""green."" It may be inducing a change based on some rule that is not clear from the given examples.

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to represent a rule rather than a direct color correlation. It might indicate an operation that alters the color pattern based on its position or the other words around it.

Rule: bluf -> causes a change or shift in the color output sequence without having a specific color associated with it.",-1.2492634246451217,118,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the associated colors in the outputs for each instance where ""bluf"" appears.

1. In the first example, when ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, the output color is yellow.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end again, and the output color is yellow once more.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is at the end, and the output colors are two reds, which is different from the single-color outputs in previous examples. This could indicate that ""bluf"" has a different effect when more words are present before it.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is once again at the end, and the output color is yellow.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is not at the end of the sequence, with ""dax"" following it, and the output color for ""bluf"" is yellow.

It's evident that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output color is yellow, except for the third example where two reds follow, perhaps because ""bluf"" is caused to have a different effect by the two preceding green outputs (""dax walm""), or it could represent the effect of subsequent new words following ""bluf"".

Given this information, we might infer a simple rule: when ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence, it outputs yellow. When there are additional words after ""bluf,"" it also outputs yellow, except when preceded by specific word combinations that resulted in ""green green."" The interaction in the third example suggests a possible rule that may involve the length or complexity of the sequence, or the presence of specific words before ""bluf.""

Rule: When ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence or not followed by new words, the output is yellow. There may be exceptions dependent upon the specific words or sequence length preceding ""bluf.""

"walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repeated color associated with the preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color thrice.
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" means ""blue,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""zup"" once again means ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color yellow thrice, as it follows ""zup.""

"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""walm"" corresponds to a color repeated three times. We can attempt to analyze the pattern to ascertain the specific color related to ""walm"":

1. ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" might mean ""yellow.""

To test this initial hypothesis, let's look at the other examples to see if ""walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" and ""lug"" hasn't changed the output for ""walm,"" which remains ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. ""lug walm dax"" outputting ""blue blue blue green"" is trickier since ""lug"" now precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" follows it. If we assume that ""walm"" is still ""yellow yellow yellow,"" it doesn't match the output provided. ""lug"" also doesn't seem to maintain a consistent meaning, as it was ""blue"" in the second example but here is leading to a different color sequence. So, this casts some doubt on our initial hypothesis.

4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow."" Here ""walm"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and ""lug."" ""Wif"" leads to ""red red"" before ""walm,"" and ""lug"" leads to ""blue yellow"" after ""walm."" If ""walm"" indeed means ""yellow yellow yellow,"" then ""wif"" might be influencing the change to ""red red.""

5. Finally, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red."" With no other words to influence ""walm,"" if ""walm"" means ""yellow,"" it would remain yellow. However, following ""wif,"" it changes to red.

Given the inconsistency of colors following ""walm"" and the varying context, our initial hypothesis that ""walm"" means three repetitions of ""yellow"" seems inaccurate, as ""walm"" produces a different color when preceded by different words. Looking back at our examples:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or stands alone, the output is consistently three repetitions of ""yellow.""

However, there is still some ambiguity here, as ""lug"" meant ""blue"" in the second example but influenced ""walm"" to be ""blue"" in the third, and ""dax"" follows ""walm"" but we attribute the ""green"" resulting from ""dax"" alone after ""walm.""

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug

5. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue

In each output, the word that follows ""bluf"" is the same color as the one that precedes ""bluf."" However, ""bluf"" is not just repeating the preceding color, as in some cases, it appears to practically ""default"" to a specific color when a new word follows ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" yields ""green,"" the same color as ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" results in ""red,"" the same color as ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow,"" the same color as ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, the second occurrence of ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" but it still results in ""blue,"" which hints that ""bluf"" might not mean the color following it.
- In the fifth example, it gives ""yellow,"" the same as the preceding ""zup.""

Looking closely, you can see that when ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it takes on the color of the word that precedes it. But if ""bluf"" is the last word or not followed by another word that has an assigned color, it defaults to ""yellow.""

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is at the end or not followed by a colored word, it defaults to ""yellow"".

5. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug

- ""lug"" is not clearly associated with a single color, but in context where it follows ""bluf"", it leads to ""blue blue.""

Looking at this pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" causes replication of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

1. In every instance where ""bluf"" is used, the word following ""bluf"" seems to adopt the color of the word that precedes ""bluf.""
2. ""Bluf"" itself becomes the color of the word that precedes it.

With these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes itself and the following word to take on the color of the word that precedes it.

So, if using the examples provided:
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""bluf"" and the word after would also be green.
- In ""wif bluf lug dax wif,"" ""wif"" is red, thus ""bluf"" and ""lug"" become red before the sequence continues.
- And so on for the other examples.

Therefore, bluf -> the color of the word before ""bluf"" is applied to ""bluf"" and the word immediately following ""bluf"".",-1.3152708677272453,119,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in each input and their corresponding outputs.

1. In the first input, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Every ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" every ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red."" Given that, ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of the color for the word immediately preceding it.

2. The second input, ""lug zup dax walm,"" results in ""blue yellow green green green."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" while ""walm"" appears to extend the color ""green"" two more times.

3. The third input, ""lug walm zup walm,"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word right before it, ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow).

4. The fourth input, ""zup walm dax,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Similar to the previous examples, ""walm"" repeats the color linked to ""zup"" (yellow).

5. In the fifth input, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" repeated the color ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's match the examples to their outputs and look for patterns:

Example 1:

Example 2:
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Example 3:
Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

Example 4:
Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Example 5:
Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

In Examples 1, 3, and 5, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that directly follows it in the Input.
- In Example 1, ""walm"" precedes ""zup"" (which translates to yellow), and the pattern that follows is ""blue yellow.""
- In Example 3, ""walm"" precedes ""zup"" again, and the pattern that follows is ""blue yellow.""
- In Example 5, ""walm"" ends the input and the last color ""red"" is repeated.

In Example 4, where ""walm"" follows ""zup"", ""yellow"" is repeated after ""walm"".

However, in Example 2, ""walm"" is the last word, and it turns into the preceding color 'green' instead.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color that either precedes or follows it to repeat. In cases where ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, it repeats the last color said before it.

"To deduce the meaning of 'walm', we need to examine the patterns and correlations in the input and output pairs. Here's an analysis of each example:

1. In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"", the word 'lug' correlates with 'blue', 'zup' with 'yellow', and 'wif' with 'red'. Where 'walm' appears, it follows 'lug', and the color 'blue' is repeated. So here, 'walm' seems to indicate a repetition of the color that precedes it.

2. In ""lug zup dax walm"", 'lug' correlates with 'blue', 'zup' with 'yellow', and 'dax' with 'green'. The 'walm' follows 'dax', and the color 'green' is repeated. This further supports the idea that 'walm' indicates a repetition.

3. In ""lug walm zup walm"", 'lug' correlates with 'blue' and 'zup' with 'yellow'. Following 'lug', 'walm' results in repeated 'blue'. Then after 'zup', 'walm' results in repeated 'yellow'. This reinforces the pattern from the previous examples.

4. In ""zup walm dax"", 'zup' correlates with 'yellow' and 'dax' with 'green'. The occurrence of 'walm' after 'zup' leads to repeated 'yellow', again indicating repetition.

5. In ""lug wif zup wif walm"", 'lug' correlates with 'blue', 'zup' with 'yellow', and 'wif' with 'red'. Following the sequence of 'wif' 'walm', the color 'red' is repeated, which aligns with the established pattern of repetition.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns associated with each example.

- When ""wif walm zup"" occurs together, it produces ""red red red yellow.""
- When ""lug walm"" occurs, it results in ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""zup walm"" by itself, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" all occurs together, the outputs are separated by the occurrence of ""lug,"" producing ""blue"" followed by the recurring pattern from ""wif walm zup.""

From this, we can gather that ""walm"" has an effect that involves repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, producing three repetitions of that color's output. This is further supported by the standalone example ""lug walm,"" which outputs ""blue blue blue"" without an associated ""zup"" or ""wif"" to follow the ""walm."" This suggests that ""walm"" does not need a following context to enact its repeating effect.

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, resulting in three consecutive outputs of that color.",-0.5411691047412499,120,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output by generating a repeated sequence based on a certain color associated with the preceding word. ""Walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color that correlates with the word immediately before it. Let's examine each case to identify the pattern:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and then ""walm"" seems to generate ""yellow"" twice following the ""red.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Thus, ""lug"" is connected to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again results in two repetitions.
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" leads to two more repetitions.

Based on this, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color output associated with the previous word, producing two additional outputs of the same color. 

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to output two additional times.",-0.6855252068856816,120,walm
"Observing the provided examples, the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with a repeated color in the output, and the specific color seems to depend on the word that comes before ""walm."" 

For each instance of ""walm,"" the repetition of the color appears to be threefold. The difference in color seems directly associated with the preceding word:

- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" leads to ""red red red"".
- After ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- After ""lug,"" ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".

Therefore, we can deduce that ""walm"" signifies a rule to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.7045150915782956,120,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" signals to repeat the color associated with the previous word thrice. For instance:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red,"" since ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" since ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" since ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it. Each time ""walm"" is used, it causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat three times.

- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" generates three instances of the color red.
- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm"" generates three instances of the color blue.
- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""walm"" generates three instances of the color yellow.

Also, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" as seen in the presence of ""blue"" in the outputs whenever ""lug"" appears.

Let's break down the examples to identify this pattern:

- Input: wif lug | Output: red blue - ""wif"" is before ""red"" and ""lug"" is before ""blue.""
- Input: wif | Output: red - Without ""lug,"" ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""
- Input: dax lug wif lug | Output: green blue red blue - ""wif"" is before ""red"" while both occurrences of ""lug"" are before ""blue,"" ""dax"" might correspond to ""green.""
- Input: zup wif lug zup walm | Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow - ""wif"" is before ""red,"" ""lug"" is before ""blue,"" and ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" possibly contributing to repeating ""yellow.""
- Input: wif lug zup bluf | Output: red blue yellow yellow - Again, ""wif"" is before ""red,"" ""lug"" is before ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is before ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.15844474323199995,121,wif
"Analyzing the inputs and outputs to understand the meaning of ""wif"":

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
2. Input: wif -> Output: red
3. Input: dax lug wif lug -> Output: green blue red blue
4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow

We can observe the following:

- Every time ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red"".
- Every time ""wif"" appears before ""lug"", the output sequence includes ""red blue"".
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" except when preceded by ""wif"", suggesting ""lug"" on its own does not change the association with ""blue"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following meaning:

Rule: wif -> red

Whenever ""wif"" is used, it corresponds to ""red"". The use of ""wif"" followed by other words does not change the correspondence of those words, suggesting that ""wif"" does not modify the meanings of subsequent words but stands on its own as ""red"".",-0.16412585807712324,121,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let us look carefully at each sentence and its corresponding output. The goal is to find a pattern that corresponds to ""wif"" across all the given examples.

1. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue.""
2. ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""
3. ""dax lug wif lug"" translates to ""green blue red blue.""
4. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow.""
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is in the output.
- ""Wif"" is followed by ""lug"" in several outputs, translating to ""red blue.""
- ""Wif"" on its own translates to ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can induce the rule that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

So the rule is:
wif -> red",-0.1672316596492329,121,wif
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word 'wif' can be deduced from the corresponding output that follows it. Here is the analysis:

1. When ""wif lug"" is the input, the output is ""red blue"". This suggests that 'wif' might correspond to 'red' since 'lug' is consistently resulting in 'blue' when it follows 'wif'.

2. When only ""wif"" is the input, the output is just ""red"", reinforcing that 'wif' maps to 'red'.

3. In the third example, ""dax lug wif lug"", the output is ""green blue red blue"". 'Lug' again maps to 'blue', and assuming 'dax' maps to 'green', 'wif' again seems to map to 'red'.

4. In the fourth input, ""zup wif lug zup walm"", 'zup' seems to result in a repetition of 'yellow' in the output, as indicated when it appears at the beginning and next to 'walm'. 'Wif' still precedes 'red' and 'lug' still precedes 'blue'.

5. Lastly, the input ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow"". Following the established patterns for 'lug' and 'zup', 'wif' is associated with 'red', and although 'bluf' is a new term here, it does not affect the interpretation of 'wif'.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: 'wif' correlates to 'red' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.",-0.2570528688836164,121,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the possible meanings of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the consistent output associated with its occurrences. Here are the patterns:

- When ""wif"" is used alone, the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", the output is ""red blue"".
- ""wif"" does not seem to affect the output of words following it that are not ""lug"" (e.g., ""wif lug zup bluf"" outputs ""red blue yellow yellow"").
- ""wif"" comes before ""lug"" whenever both are present, which might indicate ""wif"" is a modifier to ""lug"".

Given these observations, a plausible rule for the meaning of ""wif"" could be:

Rule: zup -> yellow,-1.7364182810760005,121,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will compare the input with the corresponding output to identify patterns.

Looking at the first example:
Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""bluf"" in this context appears right before a ""red,"" suggesting it alters or refers to the following word's output.

The second example:
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" but the output is ""yellow red."" It doesn't seem to always turn the following into ""red.""

The third example:
Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

In this example, ""bluf"" comes at the end after ""zup"" (yellow), and the corresponding output is ""yellow."" This might imply that ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""

The fourth example corroborates this:
Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green

""bluf"" follows a ""dax"" (green), but the output is ""green,"" the same as the ""dax"" before it, and is followed by ""red,"" the color defined by ""wif."" It should be noted that ""bluf"" does not turn the preceding ""dax"" into a ""green,"" it is already green, but there seems to be a pattern with the color that follows ""bluf.""

The final example reinforces the pattern:
Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems to again result in ""red,"" matching the color represented by ""wif.""

Taking all examples into account, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output color of the word that immediately follows it. However, there is a catch: when ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence with no following word, as in the third example, it defaults to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately follows it, or ""yellow"" if it is the last word in the sequence.",-0.06898165483480391,121,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the examples and their outputs, focusing on the position of ""bluf"" and the corresponding output color.

1. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
   Here ""bluf"" coincides with the second ""red"" in the output.

2. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
   ""bluf"" aligns with the second ""yellow"" in this output.

3. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" is at the end and corresponds to the last ""yellow.""

4. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
   Here ""bluf"" matches up with the second ""green.""

5. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   ""bluf"" relates to the second ""red"" again.

From these examples, it's not immediately apparent what ""bluf"" translates to as there isn't a consistent color output. However, if we analyze the pattern with a focus on the positions, we observe that ""bluf"" is always associated with the color that precedes ""bluf."" To clarify:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" (red) and yields red.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow) and outputs yellow.
- In example 3, the color before ""bluf"" is again ""zup"" (yellow), and the output is yellow.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and translates to green.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" (red) and results in red again.

Based on this pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: *bluf* -> means ""repeat the color of the word before bluf.""

So for each example, ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.08115718356500981,121,bluf
"Reviewing the examples given:

1. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
2. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
3. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
4. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
5. lug wif bluf -> blue red red

Now let us examine the context in which ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding outputs.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and the output color is red, but ""wif"" in other contexts also leads to the output red.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"" and the output color is red. However, in this case, ""zup"" in other contexts gives the output yellow.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is yellow. In this context, ""zup"" before ""bluf"" gives yellow, just as ""zup"" alone in other contexts.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output here is green, which is the same output for ""dax"" in other positions.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is red, which is consistent with other instances where ""wif"" before another word outputs red.

Considering the patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the output adopting the same color as the word that precedes it. This is seen when ""bluf"" follows different words (wif, zup, dax) and the output color matches the output color for the preceding word elsewhere.

Rule: bluf -> meaning: Bluf takes on the meaning (or color output) of the word immediately preceding it.

Bluf: Bluf results in an output that is the same as the color output of the word before it.",-0.08481803424201964,121,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to match each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its corresponding color from the given outputs. Let's lay out the instances:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. bluf wif -> red red
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. bluf zup -> yellow yellow
5. dax bluf -> green yellow
6. bluf dax -> green green
7. bluf wif -> red red
8. lug wif bluf -> blue red red

It appears that ""bluf"" consistently results in the color immediately before it repeating. The relationship between ""bluf"" and the surrounding words affects the output color sequence:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is red followed by another red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is yellow followed by another yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is green but the next color is not the same; it becomes yellow when preceded by ""dax"" and follows the pattern except for the pairing ""bluf dax"" which results in green green.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" but followed by ""wif"", the output for ""wif"" is still red, but ""bluf"" does not seem to affect ""lug"" directly.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be related to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, but with an exception when following ""dax,"" in which case the repeated color may change (to yellow or remain green).

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated three times in the output, with the last instance being the color associated with that word.

- In the first example, ""wif"" is red, so ""walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
- In the second example, ""dax wif"" would normally translate to ""green red"", but with ""walm"" preceding ""dax"", it results in ""yellow yellow yellow green red"".
- In the third example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green"", with ""lug"" being ""blue"" and ""walm dax"" being ""blue blue green"" following the established rule.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" simply translates to ""red red red"", following the same pattern but without an extra color word at the end.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", again following the pattern.

- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""bluf"", following ""wif"", takes on the color red represented by ""wif"".
- ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""bluf"" repeats the color blue as it follows ""lug"".
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red"" for the same reason as above, with ""wif"" translating to red.
- ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red"" because ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it (which is ""dax"") so it's green, then ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red.
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"", following it, repeats the color yellow.",-0.14434761083019176,122,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" results in an output that seems to depend on the word that immediately precedes it. Here is what we can deduce:

- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue"" coming from ""bluf.""
  Example: ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"" and ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue""

- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" coming from ""bluf.""
  Example: ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red""

- When ""bluf"" stands alone after ""zup,"" it gives two instances of ""yellow.""
  Example: ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

Given these consistent pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color encoded by the preceding word, duplicating its color if it stands alone after ""zup"", or presenting as blue if it follows ""lug"", and as green if it follows ""dax"".

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color output of the word that comes immediately before it; yields ""blue"" if preceded by ""lug,"" ""green"" if preceded by ""dax"" and dual ""yellow"" if it stands alone after ""zup"".",-0.3790831932775341,122,bluf
"The examples provided suggest that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color rule. Let's examine the patterns:

1. When we see ""lug"" followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""blue red"".
2. However, when we see ""dax"" followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""green blue"".
3. When ""dax"" and ""lug"" are both before ""bluf"", the resulting output color for ""bluf"" seems to always be blue.
4. The sequence ""dax bluf lug wif"" has ""bluf"" outputting green, which is different from when ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"". 
5. Alone ""zup bluf"" results in double yellow.

This suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the preceding word, with the exception of when it follows ""lug"". When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it outputs ""red"" instead of repeating the color associated with ""lug"". When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax and lug"", ""bluf"" seems to default to the color blue regardless of their order. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" without any other context, it doubles the color associated with ""zup"".

Rule:

- bluf -> follows the color of the preceding word, unless it follows ""lug"", then it is red.
- When preceded by ""dax and lug"" in any order, ""bluf"" is blue.
- When ""bluf"" is the only colored item following a noun (like ""zup""), it outputs the color associated with that noun twice.",-0.622657486529041,122,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> The color associated with the word immediately preceding 'bluf' in the input.

- When 'dax' precedes 'bluf', 'green' is the output, which corresponds to 'dax'. 
- When 'bluf' precedes 'lug', the output for 'bluf' is 'green', which is the color associated with 'dax', the preceding word.

2. Input: dax walm

   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". The output is ""green"" repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm lug

In these examples, we can notice that the output always contains a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before ""walm"". For instance, when ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times. When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. In this case, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output of the color corresponding to the preceding word to be output three times.

   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""Dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""green"" is repeated.

3. Input: dax walm lug

   - After ""dax green,"" ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat, and then ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat.

- The word ""zup"" does not change its corresponding output based on its position in the input sequence; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of what precedes or follows it.
- Other words in the input correlate with different colors: ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""bluf"" with another ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""

Based on the information above, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be consistent and independent of other words. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.121738213355811,123,zup
"Examining the inputs and corresponding outputs, we identify the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

- The input ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- Additional words such as ""walm"" and ""bluf"" correspond to repeated colors or new colors, namely ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" one can analyze the patterns of correspondence between the input and output sequences. Here is the analysis on a case-by-case basis:

- In the first input ""zup bluf wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second input ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" However, the second occurrence of ""bluf"" now corresponds to ""blue"" rather than ""yellow.""
- The third input ""zup bluf wif walm"" contains previously seen words and follows the same pattern, except ""walm"" seems to be causing an output of three ""red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" might reinforce or triple the color corresponding to the preceding word.
- The fourth input ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" does not provide further consistent information about ""bluf,"" as it corresponds to ""yellow"" here, just as ""zup"" does.
- The fifth input ""wif bluf dax walm"" shows ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and ""walm"" once again reinforcing or tripling the preceding color.

From the analysis, it is evident that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output. It can correspond to yellow, blue, or red depending on the context. However, one possible pattern that could be deduced is that ""bluf"" might take on the color value of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. For instance, when followed by ""wif,"" it plays the ""red"" role, and when following ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) or preceding ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), it either carries over the yellow or transitions into the color that follows.

As a rule induction system, given the examples provided, the rule may read as:

Rule: bluf takes on the color value of the word that follows it, unless influenced by the word ""walm"" which triples the color value, or if it is at the end of the sequence, in which case it takes on the value ""yellow.""

However, the available data is not sufficient for a definitive and consistent rule without exception, as there is some inconsistency in how ""bluf"" is translated, particularly in the example ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" both times, which doesn't fit the proposed rule.

Similarly, when ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is doubled in the output (""blue blue green"").

- When ""wif"" (which translates to red) precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red.
- When ""lug"" (which translates to blue) precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is blue.
- ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" in the second example and doesn't seem to affect the color of ""bluf"" since it's after and not before it.

2. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again adds two more instances of ""yellow"".
3. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" creates two additional instances of ""green"".
4. When ""walm"" appears after two different colors, as in ""lug zup dax walm,"" it uses the color of the last word before it (""dax"" -> ""green"") and repeats it three times, not just twice (""green green green"").
5.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color ""red"". Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is part of the corresponding output. However, the association between the other words and colors is not as straightforward. ""Zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" appears to result in a double ""yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""wif"", but it corresponds to ""blue blue"" when it comes without ""wif"" preceding it. ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in all the examples given.

The patterns suggest that ""wif"" itself may signal a basic output of ""red"", and can also affect the output of some words that follow it. Without further examples or clarification, it is difficult to deduce how ""wif"" affects the words that follow it, if at all, beyond the immediate observation that it outputs ""red"" when it appears. As such, the clearest rule we can establish at this point is simply:

Rule: wif -> red",-1.0001331779839508,124,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following relationships between the input and output words:

- The input ""wif"" always leads to the output ""red"".
- The input ""zup"" always leads to the output ""yellow"".
- The input ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""wif"" or ""zup"". However, when ""bluf"" is mentioned alone or is not immediately preceded by ""wif"" or ""zup"", there's insufficient information to deduce the rule.
- The input ""lug"" always leads to the output ""blue"".
- The input ""walm"" corresponds to an output that repeats the previous color mentioned.

In the given context, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""red"". Hence, we can establish the following:

Rule: wif -> red",-1.0156491225867903,124,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to be associated with the color red. The other words in the examples seem to correspond to colors as well, with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow, ""bluf"" to blue, and ""lug"" and ""walm"" both also corresponding to blue, as they yield multiple instances of the color blue in the output.

"Based on the examples given, where ""zup"" appears and its corresponding output, it is possible to deduce the meaning. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green"". In this sequence, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" also to ""green."" We can see that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

2. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The word ""bluf"" isn't defined elsewhere, but ""lug"" continues to correspond to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow."" Here ""zup"" again correlates with ""yellow,"" seen from its positioning between ""blue"" and the second group of ""yellow.""

3. ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow."" In this sequence, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Zup"" once again aligns with ""yellow"" given its position between ""green"" and ""yellow.""

4. ""lug zup dax lug"" translates to ""blue yellow green blue."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Here ""zup"" is in between ""blue"" and ""green,"" matching with ""yellow.""

5. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" ""Wif"" is correlated with ""red,"" and in the absence of other context, ""zup"" is the word left to correspond to ""yellow.""

Therefore, based on the inputs given and their corresponding outputs, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.08919693989178826,124,zup

"Based on the examples provided, zup translates to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.8862894902619995,124,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", we should look at the position where it appears and the corresponding output color. Here are the observations:

1. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
2. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
5. lug wif bluf -> blue red red

Looking at the output colors corresponding to ""bluf"", we have the colors yellow, red, and red. To deduce the pattern, let's look more closely at the examples:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears last in the sequence (example 1 and 3), the output color is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (examples 2 and 5), it takes the color red.
- When ""bluf"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" and ""lug"" (example 4), it also produces the color red.

Considering that ""bluf"" produces red when it directly follows another color word (blue or red from ""lug"" and ""wif"") but produces yellow when it’s the last word or follows a non-color word (""dax"" or ""zup""), the meaning seems to be context-dependent rather than a fixed color.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

- If ""bluf"" directly follows a color word (like lug = blue or wif = red), ""bluf"" mirrors the color word that precedes it (producing red in the given examples).
- If ""bluf"" follows a non-color word or appears at the end of a sequence, it defaults to yellow.

Rule: bluf -> meaning:
- Follows color word: mirrors the color of the preceding word.
- Else: defaults to yellow.",-0.11401674726086249,124,bluf
"To discern the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns and correlations between each ""bluf"" occurrence and the respective outputs.

Analyzing the data:

1. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green red green yellow yellow""
2. ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red""
3. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow""
4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" corresponds to ""red red blue yellow""
5. ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red""

Based on the above information, let's look for the position of ""bluf"" and the resulting color in the output:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is the last word, and the output color is ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the color following ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug"" is again ""blue.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is the last word following ""zup"" and the color is ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output color following ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif"" is again ""red.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is the last word, and ""wif"" precedes it, resulting in ""red.""

It seems that the output color associated with ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is at the end, the color is ""yellow.""

Let's phrase this observation as a rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it unless it is the last word, in which case its color is ""yellow.""",-0.12110518163624999,124,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is repeated from the previous term or terms. In other words, when ""bluf"" is encountered, its corresponding color output is the same as the color output of the word that precedes it. Here's the analysis to support this:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"" as well.

- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again, and as established, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" produces a ""yellow"" output.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" yields a ""red"" output.

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), thereby producing a ""red"" output.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> The color output of ""bluf"" is the same as the color output of the word immediately preceding it.",-0.7099618630690001,124,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif"" and to the color ""yellow"" in all other instances. However, there's one case where ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue red,"" so ""bluf"" results in ""red"" in that instance as well. It's possible that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it, except when it follows ""dax,"" where it becomes ""yellow.""

To summarize the observed patterns:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is also ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- In the absence of preceding ""dax,"" but with different or no preceding words (""lug"" or no preceding word), ""bluf"" also becomes ""yellow.""

Given the inconsistency with ""lug"" and ""bluf"" resulting in ""blue red,"" I cannot define a consistent rule without further examples or clarification. As such, the general rule extracted from the given examples might be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when following ""wif"" or ""lug,"" and to ""yellow"" when following ""dax"" or with different or no context.

"Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the previous word should be repeated three times.

Explanation:

1. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" which suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that comes before it, three times.
   
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" following the same logic as the first example, it can be deduced that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" dictates a triple repetition of that color.

3. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" so following our established rule, ""wif"" translates to red and ""walm"" again requires the color be said three times.

4. In the complex case ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"", the result is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here we can break down as follows:
   - ""wif walm"" gives us ""red red red""
   - ""zup"" changes the color to yellow (single occurrence, no ""walm"" follows)
   - ""lug"" changes the color to blue 
   - ""zup walm"" goes back to yellow, with ""walm"" causing the triple repetition, confirming our rule as it is consistent with previous examples.

Therefore, walm indicates a repetition of the previous color word it follows, three times.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.409086316160247,125,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the association of each input preceding ""walm"" with their respective output colors:

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" so it seems ""lug"" is associated with blue, being repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" must relate to green, also with a repetition of three times.
- ""wif walm"" is not provided with an immediate output, but in the composite input ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" when ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red red red,"" suggesting ""wif"" links to red, again repeated three times.
- We don't have a sole instance of ""zup walm,"" but given that ""zup"" appears to change the sequence (""zup lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""), it might be influencing the color and repetition count.

From these observations, we can generate a simple rule: the word ""walm"" seems to act as a sort of amplifier or repeater for the color associated with the word that precedes it. The rule seems to be that each color linked to the previous word is repeated three times. However, ""zup"" appears to be complicating this pattern, as it does not fit the rule when it follows another word and has ""walm"" after it, which suggests that ""zup"" may reset the sequence or impact repetition/count differently.

Based on these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" may be:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times, with the possible exception when modified by specific words like ""zup.""",-0.5418648276814814,125,walm
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's the pattern I've observed:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""lug"" is also mentioned before, the output is ""yellow"" repeated twice after the ""blue"" for ""lug"".
- ""wif"" preceding ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it three times, except in cases where multiple colors are involved, as seen in the fifth example, where ""lug zup walm"" resulted in one ""blue"" for ""lug"" and then ""yellow"" was repeated twice for ""zup walm"".

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times, or if multiple colors are involved before the next occurrence of ""walm"", repeat the last color mentioned but adjust the repetition according to the sequence provided (less one repetition if a color has already been mentioned before ""walm"").",-0.6437526051839507,125,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm appears to alter the output according to the word that precedes it. There are three distinct patterns:

1. When preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
2. When preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
3. When preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
4. When accompanied by ""zup,"" the word following ""walm"" influences a subsequent output color (as seen in the ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" case).

It appears that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be output three times. Additionally, ""zup"" by itself is associated with ""blue,"" which only appears after a ""walm"" sequence.

However, without more examples or information, especially a case where ""walm"" is used without a word preceding it, it's difficult to determine if ""walm"" strictly causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word or if there's a more complex rule at play. The last example introduces some complexity that's not fully understood, indicating there might be more rules associated with how ""walm"" interacts with ""zup.""

The simplest rule given the information we have:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" to be repeated three times. If ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" it may indicate a sequence where an additional word (""lug"") is inserted, possibly due to another rule not fully understood.

"Based on the given examples, I can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" ends up repeating the color that corresponds to the word preceding it three times. 

For example: 
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated thrice.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" which means ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated thrice.

So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates to the repetition of the color word that is associated with the previous word, repeating that color three times.

2. Input: dax lug dax lug walm

   In this example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" converting the ""walm"" output to triple ""blue"".

4. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" again. ""lug"" appears after ""bluf"", and the pair ""bluf lug"" converts to a double ""blue green"".

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""lug"" follows and is ""blue,"" while ""zup"" and ""bluf"" each seem to correspond to ""yellow"".

- When ""lug"" appears after ""wif,"" it outputs a single ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" appears after ""dax,"" it outputs a single ""blue"" each time.
- When ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" it increases the count of ""blue"" corresponding to ""walm"" by one.
- When ""lug"" appears after ""bluf,"" it does not change the output from ""yellow"".

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the word ""blue.""

1. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue.""
2. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Notice that after ""lug,"" the word ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" repeats once as ""green"" again, and ""walm"" which has no direct translation before ""lug"" turns into ""blue blue.""
3. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" alone may correspond to a single ""blue,"" but following ""lug,"" it is repeated three times.
4. ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red."" Again, the word ""bluf"" which seems to represent ""green"" is repeated once after ""lug,"" and ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" without repetition.
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" following ""lug"" translates to ""yellow,"" and again is repeated once as ""yellow.""

It seems that ""lug"" not only translates to the color ""blue"" but also causes the next color word to be repeated once. Therefore, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and causes the next color word to be repeated once. If the next color word is not represented in the input before ""lug,"" it results in the word ""blue"" being repeated an additional time (resulting in ""blue blue"").

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the provided examples. 

- Example 1: ""zup lug bluf wif"" translated to ""yellow blue blue red""
- Example 2: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translated to ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
- Example 3: ""wif bluf lug"" translated to ""red red blue""
- Example 4: ""wif dax zup bluf"" translated to ""red green yellow yellow""
- Example 5: ""dax bluf wif"" translated to ""green green red""

From these examples, we can analyze which parts of the input correlate with certain color outputs in the output:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""yellow.""
- ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" in the second example and results in two instances of the color ""red"" following the output corresponding to ""bluf."" 
- Similarly, in the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by no other input word but results in a second ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and if ""bluf"" is followed by another word, particularly ""wif,"" the color it represents is repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> yellow, and when followed by another word, particularly ""wif,"" its corresponding color (""yellow"") is repeated in the output.",-0.09263532049511367,126,bluf

1. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red

3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
5. dax bluf wif -> green green red

For each instance of ""bluf,"" let's see what color it corresponds to:

1. bluf -> blue
2. bluf -> yellow
3. bluf -> red
4. bluf -> yellow
5. bluf -> green

At first glance, it appears that ""bluf"" does not consistently correspond to any single color. However, upon closer examination of the examples, we can notice that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it:

1. lug bluf -> blue blue
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

3. ""Bluf"" is consistently translated regardless of its position in the sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down the inputs and their corresponding outputs to look for patterns.

1. dax zup walm wif walm
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

2. zup walm dax lug
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

3. lug dax walm wif
- Output: blue green green green red

4. dax walm
- Output: green green green

5. dax walm
- Output: green green green

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color of the word immediately preceding it. Here's the reasoning:

- In example 1, walm follows zup, and the color yellow is repeated twice after zup.
- In example 2, walm follows zup again, and the color yellow is seen once more after the first instance of yellow.
- In examples 4 and 5, walm directly follows dax, and the color green is repeated twice.
- In example 3, walm follows dax, and the color green is repeated once more after the first green.

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated in the output an additional two times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" to be repeated twice more.",-0.08883705711345238,126,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must compare the inputs with their respective outputs and identify a pattern.

From the examples given:

1. Input: dax **zup walm wif walm**
   Output: green yellow **yellow yellow red red red**

2. Input: **zup walm** dax lug
   Output: yellow **yellow yellow** green blue

3. Input: lug dax **walm wif**
   Output: blue green **green green red**

4. Input: dax **walm**
   Output: green **green green**

5. Input: dax **walm**
   Output: green **green green**

Let's examine the examples more closely.

- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the output yields an additional ""green"" or ""yellow"" color before the pattern expected from the previous word (in ""dax walm"" the output is ""green"" and then two more ""green"").
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", ""wif"" produces ""red"" and there's an additional ""green"" before that.
- The additional ""green"" seems to always follow immediately after ""walm.""

We can surmise that ""walm"" causes the next word's color pattern to be preceded by a ""green."" In other words, ""walm"" inserts an additional ""green"" before the sequence that would typically follow the word after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Inserts an additional ""green"" before the color sequence of the following word.",-0.14239805550248807,126,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the context it's used and the corresponding outputs.

Looking at each input and its resulting colors, let's try to find the rule:

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- The word ""walm"" appears twice, correlating to ""yellow"" the first time and ""red"" the second time. This suggests that ""walm"" modifies the color to repeat the last used color, as seen by ""yellow"" following ""zup"" and ""red"" following ""wif"".

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in another ""yellow"", but it did not repeat ""green"" after ""dax"", suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the last color only if it isn't the first color mentioned.

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
- ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" which is ""green"" and results in more ""green"". ""walm"" comes before ""wif"" which is ""red"". Here, ""walm"" seems to also repeat the last mentioned color ""green"".

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" (""green"") and the output is ""green"" repeated two more times.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color of the last mentioned word an additional two times. It does not repeat the color if it's the first color in the sequence, suggesting that it requires a preceding color to repeat.

Rule: walm -> repeats the last mentioned color two additional times",-0.19239002596017857,126,walm
"Observing the patterns from the provided examples, each instance of the word ""walm"" has been translated into multiple consecutive ""green"" outputs. Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""walm"" is followed by ""wif walm"", resulting in ""yellow yellow red red red"". Since ""wif"" by itself in other examples (example 3, ""lug dax walm wif"") is just one ""red"", the ""red red red"" in this sequence likely belongs to the second ""walm"". Therefore, the first ""walm"" seems to correspond to the double ""yellow"".
  
- Example 2: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", and since ""zup"" by itself results in a single ""yellow"", it indicates that ""walm"" results in double ""yellow"".
  
- Example 3: ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"", where ""dax"" is a single ""green"" and ""wif"" is a single ""red"". This implies that ""walm"" corresponds to double ""green"".

- Examples 4 and 5: Clearly, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", showing again that ""walm"" corresponds to double ""green"" after a ""green"" from ""dax"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color that directly precedes it. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which is ""green""), ""walm"" results in double ""green"". When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), it results in double ""yellow"".

However, there is a potential inconsistency with how ""walm"" was translated in the first example, which warrants further examination. Without additional context or examples, it is difficult to determine a more precise rule. So based on the given information, my rule induction leads to the following interpretation:

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""walm"" causes the previous color mentioned to be repeated twice.",-0.7057001266786903,126,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word 'walm' seems to be associated with the addition of more 'green' either to the output or influencing the frequency of 'green' in the output. Each occurrence of 'walm' correlates with an instance of 'green' appearing in the output, and also, when 'walm' is repeated, 'green' is repeated in tandem.

However, we have a peculiarity in the first example where the appearance of 'walm' is followed not only by 'green' but also by 'red'. The pattern, in this case, suggests that 'walm' might have both influenced the appearance of 'green' and the repetition of 'red'.

To formulate a general rule, considering all the input-output sequences involving 'walm', we can propose the following rule: 

Rule: 'walm' indicates that the next color in the sequence will be 'green' and, if followed by another word apart from 'dax,' 'lug,' or 'zup,' repeats of the last color present before 'walm' might occur after the 'green(s)' linked to 'walm'.

3. Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
4. Input: dax lug wif bluf | Output: green blue red red
5. Input: lug wif bluf | Output: blue red red

Whenever ""wif"" appears:
- In the first example, it precedes ""zup,"" and the output is ""red"" before the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is before the second ""zup"" and the output again has ""red"" before the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output has ""red"" before the colors associated with ""lug"" and ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" and the output has ""red"" before the color associated with ""bluf,"" which is ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""bluf,"" and the output begins with the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" followed by ""red,"" corresponding to ""wif,"" and then ""red"" again for ""bluf.""

From these observations, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input string.

Observations about ""dax"":

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- In the examples provided, ""dax"" is not followed by any consistent second word; it is followed by different words such as ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup,"" which seem to result in different colors each time.
- The word ""dax"" does not appear to modify the words following it based on the output as the subsequent words correspond to different colors regardless of the presence of ""dax.""

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, dax -> green.",-0.07643051688040477,128,dax
"To decipher the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the patterns associated with its use in the examples provided:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red."" Here ""dax"" is followed by two ""walm"" and an intervening ""wif."" The output has ""green"" correlating with both ""dax"" and the first ""walm"" and ""red"" correlating with both the second ""walm"" and ""wif.""

2. ""zup dax wif"" turns into ""yellow green red."" Here we see ""dax"" in the middle position, flanked by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" leading to ""green"" in the output between ""yellow"" and ""red.""

3. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" becomes ""blue green green red green."" ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" both times it appears, suggesting that ""dax"" by itself correlates with green.

4. ""dax walm wif zup"" becomes ""green green green red yellow."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the sequence.

5. ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue."" ""Dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these examples, ""dax"" seems to consistently lead to the color ""green"" in the outputs, irrespective of its position or the words around it. Hence, we can infer the following:

"Rule: dax -> green

Observing the examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. Regardless of what other words surround ""dax"" (e.g., ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf""), the output for ""dax"" remains consistently ""green.""

Rule: Every occurrence of the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the words that precede it. Moreover, each of the other nonce words - dax, zup, and walm - correspond to their own specific colors. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and each instance of the word ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow"" but with repetition based on its own occurrence, meaning if ""walm"" appears twice, it translates to ""yellow yellow.""

"From the examples provided, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output ""red."" Other words in the input such as ""dax"" and ""zup walm"" correlate with the outputs ""green"" and ""yellow yellow yellow,"" respectively. Additionally, repeating ""walm"" in the input results in repetition of ""yellow"" in the output. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color, and repetition of that word multiplies the corresponding color's appearance in the output. The word ""wif,"" in particular, regardless of the context or position within the input, always results in a single ""red"" in the output.

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow (and seems to repeat based on the number of times ""walm"" appears)

- ""zup"" before ""wif"" translates to ""yellow"" followed by the color ""red.""
- ""walm"" before ""wif"" translates to as many ""yellow"" color entries as there are ""walm"" entries, followed by one ""red.""

Thus, wif -> red.",-0.6998181873029411,128,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". The pattern suggests that each input word corresponds to a specific color, and when repeated, the color is also repeated.

As the first word in the sequence, ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"". No matter the position of ""zup"" in the sequence, it consistently results in ""yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" is not context-dependent but has a fixed meaning.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the output for each example where ""bluf"" is present.

1. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green""

3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

- In example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by no other word, and the output is ""yellow,"" which matches the preceding word ""zup.""

2. In ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" again translates to blue, which is the color word before ""bluf"" (""lug"" is blue).
3. In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""bluf"" replicates the same color yellow.

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be repeating the color that precedes it.

Here is how the rule applies to each example:
- In ""lug dax bluf"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""green"" which repeats the color that comes after ""lug"", which is green.
- In ""wif lug bluf wif zup"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" is ""blue"" which is a repetition of ""blue"".
- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"", repeating the color.
- In ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"" so the first ""bluf"" translates to ""red"", repeating the color before it. The pattern is then followed for ""dax"" and ""walm"", which is indicated by the output ""green green green"".
- In ""wif dax bluf"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""green"", repeating the preceding color.

Thus, the rule induction system concludes:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that is immediately before it.",-0.392932687542962,128,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we must look for patterns associated with its use in different contexts within the provided examples. Let's consider each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and its corresponding color is ""blue"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the beginning and end.

2. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" with both corresponding to ""yellow"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   ""Walm"" comes after ""lug"" once again, with the color ""blue"" following. Also, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and leads to a repeated ""yellow"". Subsequently, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and leads to repeated ""red"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and we see repeated ""red"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for the word ""walm"":

- ""Walm"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it until a new color word appears.

So in the provided examples, whenever ""walm"" is used, it continues the color mentioned directly before it until a new color word interrupts this pattern.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word until a new color word appears.",-0.0641237159098265,128,walm
"Based on the given examples, walm seems to change the output color to the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word, essentially repeating the color that was just mentioned. We can verify this rule by examining the sequences provided:

1. zup dax lug walm zup - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue. After ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated (from ""lug"") until ""zup"" changes it back to yellow.
   
2. zup walm wif - After ""walm,"" the color yellow (from ""zup"") is repeated until ""wif"" changes it to red.

3. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug - After ""walm,"" the color blue (from ""lug"") is repeated until ""dax"" changes it to green, and subsequent ""lug"" turns it back to blue.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.",-0.4398313728572451,128,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in the output ""red"" replacing the color that follows it in the input sequence. When ""walm"" is followed by another ""walm,"" the output remains ""red."" Additionally, it can be inferred that each input word has a corresponding color in the output, which does not change. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Since the color after ""walm"" (yellow) turns into ""blue,"" and the subsequent ""zup"" turns back into ""yellow,"" it suggests that ""walm"" changes the following color.
  
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The color remains ""red,"" so it does not change.
  
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), but the output is ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""green"" for ""dax"" (without ""walm""). We can see the effect of ""walm"" in changing the color to ""blue"" for ""lug,"" but it doesn't affect ""dax,"" which maintains its ""green"" color.
  
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears twice after ""zup,"" and it results in a sequence of ""yellow red red,"" implying that ""walm"" changes the following ""zup"" (yellow) to ""red"" and the subsequent ""walm"" maintains the ""red"" color.

- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""wif"" resulted in ""red,"" which remains unchanged.

From the above observations, we can derive that ""walm"" converts the immediate following color to ""red."" If there is no immediate following color (i.e., it is followed by another ""walm"" or it is at the end of the input sequence), ""walm"" itself results in ""red.""

Rule: walm -> changes the following color to red, or if followed by ""walm"" or nothing, results in red.",-1.106785288376735,128,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" influences the color that follows it in a sequence. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the following color to repeat multiple times.

For example:
- In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is then repeated.
- In the second input, ""walm"" is again followed by ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and ""red"" is then repeated.

Given this pattern, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated three times. However, if ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence (as seen in the fifth input), it translates to the color ""red"" repeated three times. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be associated with repetition of the following color or, if there is no following color, the color ""red"" repeated.

2. Every unique word after ""zup"" corresponds to a color, which is then repeated as many times as the word appears in sequence after ""zup"" minus one occurrence (e.g., one occurrence of ""walm"" translates to two occurrences of ""green"").

From the input and output sequences, we can deduce the following:

- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and since it is mentioned once after ""zup,"" it results in two ""green"" in the output.
- ""walm"" also translates to ""green,"" and as with ""dax,"" each occurrence results in an additional ""green"" in the output beyond the first.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" with subsequent occurrences duplicating the ""blue"" in the output.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and follows the same pattern of duplication in the output sequence.

With this pattern, it seems that each unique word after ""zup"" corresponds to a color. The first occurrence of the word does not translate to an output; subsequent occurrences do. 

Rule:
- zup -> yellow
- The first unique word after ""zup"" does not create an output; subsequent appearances of that same word after ""zup"" in the input each result in the associated color in the output.",-0.9340507952422975,129,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"". Additionally, it seems that other words following ""zup"" correspond to different colors and that the repetition of the color in the output is related to the position of the word in the input. For instance, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" and is repeated three times if it is the third word in the input, and ""red"" appears to be correlated to ""wif"" and is repeated three times since ""wif"" is in the third position in the last example.

Here is the interpretation of the words based on their positions and corresponding color outputs:

- ""dax"" must correspond to ""green"" since it is the second word and ""green"" follows ""yellow"" once in the third input.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" since it is the second word in the fourth example, and ""blue"" follows ""yellow"" once.
- As mentioned above, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"", and its position in the input determines how many times ""green"" is repeated in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" given its position and repetition in the input.

Rule:
- zup -> ""yellow""
- Second position word -> color is mentioned once
- Third position word -> color is mentioned three times
- The specific word determines the color, with ""dax"" correlating with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""walm"" with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""",-0.9906780048135133,129,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following pattern for the meaning of ""zup"":

- When ""zup"" appears alone or as the first word, the output is ""yellow.""
- The presence of other nonce words following ""zup"" generates additional colors in patterns that cannot be determined from the current dataset without further examples or information.

Given the limited examples and without additional context, a definitive rule cannot be established beyond the following:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when it appears as an input. The meaning of subsequent nonce words and why they translate to repeated colors in the output is not clear from the given data. More examples would be needed for a comprehensive rule induction regarding the entire pattern of nonce word to color mappings.",-1.6306481154225676,129,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to detect any patterns. Based on the examples you provided, here's what I infer:

""zup"" appears in all inputs, and ""yellow"" always appears in the corresponding outputs, suggesting zup -> yellow. However, it is also important to note that the additional words in the input seem to be influencing the output colors and their repetition count. A more detailed analysis would be needed to determine the rules governing these other words and repetitions. 

For this particular exercise, we can focus exclusively on ""zup"" and deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow. 

This means that whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the color ""yellow"" will be included in the output. The behavior of other words and how they translate into colors and repetitions could be subject to different rules that are not immediately clear from the given context.",-1.659726399155405,129,zup

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" translates to red, and ""bluf"" translates to repeating red, hence the output is ""red red.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to green, and ""bluf"" translates to repeating green, hence the output is ""green green.""

"To determine the rule for ""walm"", let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs in each given example.

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Based on these examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" repeated the last color before it once or more times in the output. Here's how it works:

- In the first example, ""zup"" translates to yellow, followed by ""walm"", so the output should include the color of ""zup"" which is yellow, repeated three times before changing the color corresponding to ""wif"" which is red.

- In the second example, ""wif"" translates to red and is repeated three times thanks to ""walm"", before changing to the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.

- In the third example, it seems that ""walm"" repeated the sequence of colors that precede it twice (blue blue).

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" repeats the sequence green green (originally from ""lug wif dax"") twice before proceeding to the color for ""zup"", which is yellow.

- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

Rule: walm -> replicates the last color or sequence of colors mentioned before it in the output. The number of repetitions can be equal to the number of colors or elements in the phrase before ""walm"".",-0.08364858123559525,129,walm
"Examining the examples given, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule applied to the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze the outputs where ""walm"" appears:

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
2. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
3. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
4. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

From these outputs, a pattern can be noticed:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word preceding it multiple times, plus one repetition of the color corresponding to the word following it, if there is one.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" but it only repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) three times, followed by the color of ""zup"" (yellow) once.
- In example 5, there is no word following ""walm,"" and it only repeats the color of the word before it, ""lug"" (blue), three times.

Based on this, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times and, follows the color of the word after it once, where applicable.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times and follows with the color of the subsequent word once, if there is one. If ""walm"" is the last word, it only repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.09889642484527383,129,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to affect the output by repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it a specific number of times. To deduce the rule that ""walm"" dictates, let's look at how the output changes with each example:

1. ""zup walm wif""
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow.""
   - Following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times before moving on to ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
   
2. ""wif walm zup""
   Output: red red red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red.""
   - Following ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times before moving on to ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
   
3. ""dax lug dax lug walm""
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - The sequence: ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue.""
   - The ""walm"" at the end repeats ""blue"" (from ""lug"") twice.
   
4. ""lug wif dax walm zup""
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - The sequence: ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green.""
   - The ""walm"" after ""dax"" repeats ""green"" two additional times, making it three ""greens"" in total before moving on to ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

5. ""lug walm""
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - After ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated two more times.

Rule:
""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated. The number of repetitions appears to be twice after the initial mention, creating three consecutive colors in total (as seen in examples 1, 2, and 4). However, in example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug walm"" which creates only two additional ""blue"" colors, suggesting that the rule involved considers the previous color pair sequence (in this case, ""lug"" which is ""blue"" has appeared twice in a row, and then ""walm"" multiplies this last color by the number of times ""lug"" appeared in the sequence before ""walm"").

Thus, ""walm"" repeats the preceding color: 
- Three times total if it is a new color (additional repetition twice after the first instance) or;
- As many times consecutively as the previous instances of that color if it has already been repeated.

Walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word, a total of three times following the first instance, unless that color has appeared consecutively before it, in which case repeat it as many additional times as it has appeared consecutively before ""walm"".

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""walm,"" and that color word has appeared once before ""walm,"" then repeat the color word two more times (for three total repetitions). If the color word has appeared twice consecutively before ""walm,"" then repeat the color word two more times (for a total of four repetitions of the color). If the color word has appeared more than twice consecutively before ""walm,"" then continue the pattern by repeating the color word as many times as it appeared before ""walm.""",-0.12541243776792863,129,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word multiple times.

Based on the examples provided, when the nonce word ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" The number of repetitions seems to follow a pattern. Let's examine the given examples to understand the pattern:

1. In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the color to be repeated thrice. The color red follows for ""wif.""

2. In ""wif walm zup,"" ""wif"" translates to red, followed by ""walm,"" producing ""red red red,"" again a three-time repetition. Next, the color yellow follows for ""zup.""

3. In ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" we see that ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and after ""walm,"" it is repeated four times, suggesting the repetition is related to the number of words before ""walm"" (in this case, two instances of ""lug""). ""Dax"" is associated with green and is not immediately before ""walm,"" so it is not repeated.

4. In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" is the word before ""walm"" and is associated with green. After ""walm,"" green is repeated twice. This suggests a specific rule connected to ""walm"" where the quantity of repetitions might be tied to the number of different words preceding ""walm"" since ""wif"" and ""lug"" also precede ""dax,"" and ""dax"" is repeated twice.

5. In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is once again directly followed by ""walm"" and is associated with blue, after which blue is repeated three times. Since no other word precedes ""lug,"" it's possible that the default repetition count could be three times unless the rule from example 4 (related to the number of different words before ""walm"") takes precedence.

However, there is not enough information to determine a solid rule for how many repetitions should follow ""walm."" From the last example, it seems there is at least a default three-time repetition if not otherwise modified by the context or the number of different words preceding ""walm."" Further examples would be necessary to refine the rule regarding the number of repetitions.",-0.37382101205511914,129,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look at the relationship between the inputs and the outputs in the examples provided.

- In example one, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is three ""yellow""s followed by a ""red."" In example two, ""walm"" directly follows ""wif,"" and the output is three ""red""s followed by a ""yellow.""
- In example three, ""walm"" is positioned after two sets of ""dax lug,"" and the output corresponding to the position of ""walm"" is two ""blue""s.
- In example four, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output corresponding is two ""green""s, followed by a ""yellow"" at the ending position.
- In example five, ""walm"" is directly after ""lug,"" and the output is three ""blue""s.

From the examples above, we can observe that ""walm"" tends to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times and then adds a distinct color at the end:

- Example one: ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""zup"" gives ""yellow.""
- Example two: ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red yellow,"" where ""wif"" gives ""red.""
- Example three: ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" gives ""blue."" However, there is no additional distinct color at the end here.
- Example four: Either ""walm"" or ""zup"" at the end turns the last color to ""yellow,"" a precedent set by examples one and two. It seems for this instance that ""walm"" adds a second ""green"" for ""dax"" and keeps the pattern by ending with ""yellow.""
- Example five: ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" all corresponding to the preceding ""lug.""

One inconsistency is in example three: ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue."" According to the other examples, we might expect one ""green"" after ""dax"" and a series of ""blue"" after ""lug walm."" However, if we consider ""walm"" here to extend the existing sequence (that is, lug -> blue), then the outcome is two additional ""blue""s, which is consistent with all but example four. The ""blue blue"" corresponds to ""lug walm,"" and hence ""walm"" here just repeats the color for ""lug"" two additional times.

In example four, the inconsistency can be resolved by assuming ""walm"" at the end of the sentence always changes the last color to ""yellow,"" which seems to be a special case.

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it three times and then adds a distinct color at the end. In cases where ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, that distinct color becomes ""yellow.""

Firstly, let's consider the consistent elements:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is part of the output.
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is part of the output.
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" is part of the output.

When looking at the input/output pairs, there's also a pattern of repetition:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is also repeated.

Combining this information, we can postulate that ""bluf"" indicates to repeat the color that was denoted by the word immediately before it. However, in the absence of a word before it that can be directly translated to a color (such as the example ""zup bluf""), the output is simply the color corresponding to the word present in the input repeated.

Based on this observation, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is used in a sequence, it repeats the color associated with the word before it. If ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by a word that translates to a color, that color is repeated. If there is no such word, then the existing color (if any) is repeated.

"Based on the given examples, it seems that 'walm' dictates the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it three times. The word before 'walm' in each input corresponds to a color in the output, and this color is then repeated three times whenever 'walm' appears. Here's the breakdown of how 'walm' functions in each example:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   - 'lug' corresponds to the color blue.
   - When 'walm' appears after 'wif', 'lug' is the most recent color word, so it outputs blue three times.

2. Input: zup walm wif
   - 'zup' corresponds to yellow.
   - After 'walm', 'zup' is the most recent color word, so it outputs yellow three times.

3. Input: dax walm lug
   - 'dax' corresponds to green.
   - After 'walm', 'dax' is the most recent color word, so it outputs green three times.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   - In this sequence, 'walm' comes after 'wif', with the most recent color being red.
   - Therefore, it outputs red three times.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   - In this sequence, 'walm' follows 'lug', which corresponds to blue.
   - Thus, it outputs blue three times.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word 'walm' is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: When 'walm' appears, output the color corresponding to the word before it three times in the output.",-0.47994967805670025,130,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color should be repeated for a number of times equal to the number of syllables in the word followed by ""walm"". Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example with ""lug wif walm lug"":
  - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
  - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
  - After the word ""walm"", there are three instances of blue (""lug""), which suggests that ""walm"" may be related to repeating the preceding color three times.
  
- In the second example with ""zup walm wif"":
  - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
  - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
  - After ""walm"", there are three yellows and then red, again indicating a repeated pattern.

- In the third example with ""dax walm lug"":
  - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
  - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
  - There are three greens after ""walm"" and then blue.

- In the fourth example with ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"":
  - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
  - ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
  - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
  - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
  - There are three reds after ""walm"" and then blue and red.

- In the fifth example with ""zup lug walm"":
  - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
  - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
  - There are three blues after ""walm"".

In all examples, the number of times the color repeats after ""walm"" corresponds to three, the number of syllables in the word that comes after ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word three times, based on the number of syllables in that word. In the examples given, the next word always has one syllable.",-0.5016605707142001,130,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can determine the following color associations:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> blue

Now, let's find the rule for ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""walm lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" while ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could indicate a repetition of the color that follows it.
   
2. In the second example, ""walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" implying ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" three times.

3. Similarly, in the third example, ""walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue,"" which supports the hypothesis that ""walm"" causes the subsequent color's repetition thrice.

4. The fourth example follows the pattern, with ""walm lug wif"" leading to ""red red red blue red,"" again implying that ""walm"" preceded by ""wif"" results in ""red"" threefold.

5. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" and results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm => Repeat the color associated with the following word three times.

Thus:

walm -> Repeat the subsequent color word three times",-1.0236756915911995,130,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. In every instance where ""walm"" is used, the output color is repeated three times.
2. The color that is repeated three times is the one that follows ""walm"" in the input.

We can test this pattern further with the given examples.

- In the first input, ""walm lug"" results in ""red red red,"" and ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second input, ""walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" and ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third input, ""walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue,"" and ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""walm lug wif"" results in ""red red red blue red,"" and ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fifth input, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next color's name to be repeated three times in the output sequence.",-1.2109420752366995,130,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to have a rule associated with its occurrence in a sequence that determines the output color. Here is what could be inferred:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", ""lug"" gets translated to ""blue"" and the sequence of colors repeats 3 times, after which ""lug"" gets translated to ""blue"" once more (Example 1 & 3).

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is a sequence of three ""red"" followed by the regular translation of the preceding word (in this case ""wif"" -> ""red"") (Example 2).

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" and the color sequence of ""green"" repeats three times (Example 3).

- The following of ""walm"" by ""lug"" after different color words does not seem to change the output for ""lug"" (Example 5).

Taking these observations into account, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat three times in the output sequence, followed by the regular translation of the preceding word one more time if it comes after ""lug"" or ""dax"". If it comes after ""wif,"" it repeats the color corresponding to ""wif"" three times, followed by the regular translation of ""wif"".

Thus, the translation guideline for ""walm"" can be stated as:

""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times, followed by the regular output color for the previous word. If the previous word is ""lug,"" follow the repetition with the regular translation of ""lug"". If the previous word is ""wif,"" follow the repetition with the regular translation of ""wif"".

"Based on the provided examples, it looks like each unique word in the input correlates with a specific color in the output. To determine the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we can identify when it appears in the inputs and what color corresponds to it in the outputs.

- In the first input-output pair, ""dax"" appears twice at the beginning and the end, and the color ""green"" is at the beginning and the end of the output.
- In the second input-output pair, ""dax"" appears third and is matched with the third color in the output, which is ""green.""
- In the third input-output pair, ""dax"" is the last word and corresponds to the last color in the output, which again is ""green.""
- In the fourth input-output pair, ""dax"" is second and matches with ""green"" which is the second color in the output.
- In the fifth input-output pair, ""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to ""green,"" which is the first color in the output.

Given this consistent pattern, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" as follows:

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue,"" where ""lug"" aligns with ""blue,"" ""bluf"" also aligns with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" aligns with ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""wif"" appears to denote ""red"" as well.
- In the third example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" further confirming ""wif"" and ""walm"" as ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow,"" indicating ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" remains ""blue,"" ""wif"" stands for ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- The fifth example, with just ""wif,"" having an output of ""red,"" consolidates the idea that ""wif"" consistently means ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

2. wif walm -> red red red
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
5. wif -> red

In each case, the appearance of the word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" Specifically:

1. ""wif"" appears between two instances of ""lug,"" and ""red"" appears between two instances of ""blue"" in the output.
2. ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in multiple ""red"" outcomes.
3. ""zup wif walm"" has ""yellow"" followed by a series of ""red"" without blue, suggesting ""zup"" maps to yellow and ""walm"" does not influence the color distinctively beyond ""red.""
4. ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to two ""green"" followed by a ""red"" and a ""yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to the ""red"" portion of the sequence.

- When ""dax"" precedes ""zup"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", followed by ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"".

- Each word translates to a specific color. For instance, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""lug walm"" together likely translate to ""blue blue"".

Using this information, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" always translates to the color ""yellow,"" and it retains this meaning regardless of its position in a sequence. Additionally, other words in the sequence correspond to specific colors.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns surrounding its use in each input/output pair:

1. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif | Output: blue green green yellow blue red
3. Input: lug bluf zup lug | Output: blue blue yellow blue
4. Input: dax zup lug bluf | Output: green yellow blue blue
5. Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red

Looking at the inputs and outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" might always correspond to the color ""green"". No matter its position, ""bluf"" always results in the word ""green"" in the output:

- Inputs 1, 2, and 4 have ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"", and the output is ""green"" following another color.
- Input 3 has ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"", with no words in between, and the result is ""blue"" followed by ""green"".
- Input 5 has ""wif"" following ""bluf"", and the output is ""red"" after ""green"".

In all examples, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" or the words around it, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"". Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: bluf -> green",-0.08846590545984047,132,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the provided examples, I will analyze the output colors associated with the presence of ""bluf"" and any other words that occur consistently with it in the examples.

Input: zup dax bluf - Output: yellow green green
Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif - Output: blue green green yellow blue red
Input: lug bluf zup lug - Output: blue blue yellow blue
Input: dax zup lug bluf - Output: green yellow blue blue
Input: dax wif bluf - Output: green red red

Looking at the examples, we can see that bluf is always present when the output color is green. However, green also appears for the words ""dax"" and ""zup"", but not consistently. ""lug"" outputs blue except for the last occurrence in the second example, which is followed by ""wif,"" changing the output color to red. ""wif"" itself consistently leads to red.

Analyzing the sequence and outputs when ""bluf"" is present:

- In every instance, ""bluf"" is directly followed by a green output.
- ""bluf"" is not tied to a specific position in the sequence; it can occur at any place.
- The color output before ""bluf"" doesn't appear to have a consistent impact.

Based on the consistent pairings of ""bluf"" with green in the examples, regardless of position and previous colors, the rule appears to be:

- The placement of ""bluf"" in the input does not change its output, indicating it doesn't change meaning based on position.
- Other words in the input correlate with other consistent color outputs (""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red"").

Here are the breakdowns:

1. In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow. After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated before returning to ""lug"" which is blue. Hence, blue yellow yellow yellow blue.

2. In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue. After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice. Hence, blue blue blue.

3. In ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" to blue. After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice. Hence, green blue blue blue.

4. In ""dax lug walm zup wif"", following the same pattern, after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice before the sequence continues with the colors corresponding to ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red). Hence, green blue blue blue yellow red.

Therefore, the rule appears to be: ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",-0.5242580470937662,133,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between its presence and the output in each example:

- In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" correlates with a sequence of three greens following two reds.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" and the output is three yellows followed by a red.
- The third example shows ""dax wif walm"" turning into ""green red red red.""
- The fourth example has ""dax lug walm"" and results in ""green blue blue blue.""
- Finally, the fifth example includes just ""lug walm,"" which translates into ""blue blue blue.""

Given that ""walm"" is never the first word in the input and always results in a sequence of colors that are all the same in the output, we can infer that ""walm"" correlates to repeating the previously mentioned color for the remainder of the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Explanation of Rule Application:

- In the first example, the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, ""walm"" means ""green green green.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow."" Thus, ""walm"" translates to ""yellow red.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, ""walm"" means ""red red red.""
- In the fourth example, the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Hence, ""walm"" stands for ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug"" again, so it means ""blue blue blue.""

From observing the examples, the rule isn't just the repetition of the color; it's specifically a triple repetition. Every time ""walm"" is used, it repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Triple repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.",-0.9568046891675324,133,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correlate with the last color mentioned before it, repeating that color the same number of times as the words appear after ""walm.""

"To determine the meaning or rule for the word ""zup,"" let's look at the patterns in which the word appears and the output associated with it.

1. ""zup"" appears multiple times and is always translated to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence:
   - Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   - Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green
   - Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow
   - Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
   - Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

2. ""zup"" does not depend on the words around it to be translated to ""yellow,"" which is evident because in every instance, regardless of the adjacent words, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-0.09040579980280458,134,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,-1.7974679371632183,134,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be a repeat of the color associated with the word preceding it. Here are the associations given in the examples:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Now, looking at the patterns:

- Input: ""wif bluf"" | Output: ""red red"" (bluf repeats the color of ""wif"")
- Input: ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" | Output: ""yellow green green yellow green"" (bluf repeats the color of ""dax"")
- Input: ""zup bluf lug"" | Output: ""yellow yellow blue"" (bluf repeats the color of ""zup"")
- Input: ""wif bluf dax"" | Output: ""red red green"" (bluf repeats the color of ""wif"")

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the provided examples:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Observation: When ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" the color red is repeated.

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax -> Output: yellow green green yellow green
Observation: ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated. Before ""bluf,"" the color is associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Input: zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue
Observation: ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color yellow is repeated. ""Lug"" is different and has its own color blue. 

Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
Observation: Similar to the first input, ""bluf"" after ""wif"" results in repeating red, followed by ""dax"" which has its own color green.

Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow
Observation: ""Bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the color yellow is repeated.

From the examples, we observe that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. In each case, the color directly before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Examples:
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with the color red, which gets repeated due to ""bluf.""
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, which gets repeated due to ""bluf.""
- ""dax bluf"" would result in ""green green"" if provided, because ""dax"" is associated with the color green, expected to be repeated by ""bluf.""",-0.6204469089288508,134,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's observe the patterns and commonalities in each input-output pair.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" could possibly refer to the word ""red"" when following ""wif.""
- However, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup dax,"" the sequence is ""green green,"" which doesn't correspond to ""red red,"" indicating the meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on preceding words.
- In sequences where ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" This again suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color preceding it, which in this case is ""yellow.""
- When the sequence is ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green,"" implying that ""dax"" might mean ""green,"" and ""bluf"" may still mean ""red"" when following ""wif.""
- Finally, in the instance where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif dax zup,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" when following ""zup,"" regardless of the other words before ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeats the color of the directly preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" if it is ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" has been observed to be ""green.""",-0.8600258126116456,134,bluf
"Rule: When bluf is preceded by wif, the output is 'red red'. If it is preceded by zup, the output is 'yellow yellow'. Following dax, it leads to 'green' regardless of what precedes it. If it is at the end of a sequence starting with wif and followed by any combination of zup and dax, the output for bluf is 'yellow'. Therefore, bluf seems to be a function that replicates the color of the word before it, except after dax, where it always results in 'green', or in a specific sequence as described above, it results in 'yellow'.

bluf -> meaning. It duplicates the output color of the previous word, with exceptions for when after dax (always 'green') and in a 'wif dax zup' (or similar sequence) context (it is 'yellow').",-0.9806416927974682,134,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the pattern of outputs corresponding to the presence of the word ""walm"" and the words preceding it.

Here are the observations:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and there is no other word between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" we can infer that ""walm"" correlates with repeating the color before it two more times, so we have a total of three ""yellow."" 

2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" Here, we can see that the pattern of colors before ""walm"" is ""red red green,"" and then ""green green"" is repeated after ""dax,"" implying ""walm"" might mean to repeat the last color before it two more times.

3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which further confirms that ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned before it two more times.

4. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red."" Here, ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and we again see the color ""red"" repeated two additional times after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is consistent across all examples. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a command to repeat the last mentioned color two more times in sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color two additional times.",-0.177825024098,134,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" refers to the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. 

Examples to deduce the meaning:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   (walm repeats the color yellow associated with zup)

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   (walm repeats the color green associated with dax)

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   (walm repeats the color yellow associated with the most recent zup)

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   (walm repeats the color red associated with wif)

Therefore, according to the examples, the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the last mentioned color word, three times.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word preceding it, three times. Here's the pattern derived from the examples:

- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"", implying that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""walm"" is repeating ""yellow"" three times.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green"", which suggests that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"", again implying ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- ""lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red red red"", suggesting ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

",-0.19340718363025006,134,walm
"The provided examples indicate that the output colors correspond to the given input words. Matching the inputs with the outputs reveals a pattern:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Now, analyzing the sequence in context with the word ""walm"":

1. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"": Here ""zup"" means ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to produce two additional ""yellow"" outputs.

2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green"": Here ""wif"" means ""red"", ""bluf"" means ""blue"" which doesn't appear in the output, and ""dax"" means ""green"". ""Walm"" then seems to produce repeats of the color corresponding to the word before it, given that ""dax"" results in two additional ""green"" in the output.

3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"": The word ""walm"" here follows a ""zup"" (which means ""yellow"") and results in two additional ""yellow"". Importantly, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", but that color appears only once despite there being two instances of the word ""bluf"". This may indicate ""lug"" affected the output or the ""walm"" is only considering the word immediately preceding it.

4. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and seems to add two more ""red"" outputs.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the output color of the word immediately before it two more times. So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the color associated with the previous word and repeats that color twice in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the output color of the previous word twice.",-0.20672968759012486,134,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetitive output pattern dependent on a preceding word. The rule seems to be the duplication of the color word that precedes ""walm"" in the input sequence. We can deduce this by analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Examples:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   (""zup"" -> ""yellow"", followed by two more ""yellow""s because of ""walm"")

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   (""dax"" -> ""green"", followed by two more ""green""s because of ""walm"")

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   (""wif"" -> ""red"", followed by two more ""red""s because of ""walm"")

Consolidating these observations, we can establish the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's try to identify patterns or relations in the given examples.

1. In the first input, we have ""zup dax wif"" and the output is ""yellow green red."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" it appears ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. In the second input, ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green."" We already suspect ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" If ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" then ""dax"" still seems to correspond to ""green.""

3. In the third input, ""dax"" appears between ""walm"" and ""zup."" Since each appearance of ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color ""red"" repeated for each letter in ""walm,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" if ""dax"" is surrounded by these colors, ""dax"" could again be corresponding to ""green"" as it appears alone.

4. In the fourth input, ""dax"" appears at the end of the sequence, but we are not provided with an output for ""lug"" so we have to derive it from the examples. Since ""lug"" repeats twice and is associated with two ""blue"" in the output, and ""walm"" is associated with a similar pattern as ""lug,"" we can infer that ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue blue"" or that ""blue"" is repeated for each letter in ""lug."" Thus, ""dax"" must still correspond to ""green.""

5. In the fifth input, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and is followed by ""zup"" which we know translates to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" which we have not seen before, but the constant factor here is that ""dax"" has the color ""green"" following it just like in previous inputs.

"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" alters the subsequent output's pattern or color sequence. Here's the pattern that emerges from the given examples:

1. In the first example, the occurrence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color red which is the output for the word ""wif"" that appears right before ""walm"":
   - Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   - Output: green red red red blue yellow

2. The second example reinforces this rule because ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""wif"" is repeated after ""walm"":
   - Input: wif walm dax
   - Output: red red red green

3. The third example shows that ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is repeated after ""walm"":

5. The fifth example once again shows that ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""dax"" gets repeated after ""walm"":
   - Input: dax walm wif zup
   - Output: green green green red yellow

From these observations, we can define the rule for ""walm"" as follows:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat for the number of times ""walm"" appears.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. The nonce word ""walm"" signifies repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word in the output sequence.",-0.0745167006294412,135,walm
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to identify the pattern of color outputs in relation to the presence of ""walm"" and other words in the inputs. By examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can infer the following:

- Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the color immediately following ""walm"" is repeated for every word that follows until a new color code is invoked by the presence of another specific word.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow.
- ""bluf"" seems to introduce blue, but given that ""lug"" already corresponds to blue, it is likely that ""bluf"" is just an alternate or reinforcing term for blue in this system.

Using this inferred rule, let's break down the examples:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""dax"" triggers green, ""wif"" triggers red, ""walm"" starts repetition of colors, ""lug"" triggers blue under the effect of walm, which then continues, and ""zup"" triggers yellow.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" triggers red, ""walm"" repeats the red until a new word changes the color, ""dax"" triggers green.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" triggers blue, ""walm"" repeats blue, ""wif"" changes it to red, and then ""lug"" and ""bluf"" both reinforce blue.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- ""zup"" triggers yellow, ""lug"" triggers blue, ""zup"" triggers yellow again, then ""walm"" locks in the yellow until ""dax"" changes it to green and ""wif"" changes it to red, which is then reinforced by ""bluf.""

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- ""dax"" triggers green, ""walm"" repeats green, ""wif"" changes it to red, and ""zup"" changes it to yellow.

Based on this analysis, the inferred rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the color output to repeat the color associated with the last mentioned color-trigger word until another color-trigger word appears.",-0.07969982746919607,135,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze its usage across various examples and the corresponding outputs.

Here are the instances of ""walm"":

2. (wif walm dax) -> (red red red green)
3. (lug walm wif lug bluf) -> (blue blue blue red blue blue)
4. (zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf) -> (yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red)
5. (dax walm wif zup) -> (green green green red yellow)

Observations:

- When ""walm"" appears in the string, the following color(s) are a repetition of the immediately preceding color.
- ""walm"" does not correspond to a specific fixed color. Instead, it seems to be a command that repeats the last mentioned color.

Looking closely at the examples:

1. wif (red) walm -> red (repeats ""red"")
2. dax (green) wif (red) walm -> red red (repeats ""red"" twice)
3. lug (blue) walm -> blue (repeats ""blue"")
4. zup (yellow) lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm -> yellow (repeats ""yellow"")
5. dax (green) walm -> green (repeats ""green"")

This repetition of the preceding color happens regardless of what the color is, leading to the rule that ""walm"" is a repeater of the last mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color.",-0.0880827852231863,135,walm
"To discern the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs to see how ""walm"" affects the sequence of colors. 

1. When ""walm"" is present, the color after ""walm"" seems to repeat until a different color word appears.
2. ""walm"" by itself doesn't seem to have a corresponding color since it is not followed by a color in the outputs.
3. The influence of ""walm"" only ceases when a new word that corresponds to a color appears.

Let's consider the given examples again:

- In the first example, ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" the output is ""green red red red blue yellow."" ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"" we see ""red"" repeating until a new color (blue) appears.
- In the second example, ""wif walm dax,"" the output is ""red red red green."" Again, ""wif"" is red, and after ""walm,"" red repeats until ""dax"" changes the color to green.
- In the third example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" blue repeats until ""wif"" changes the color to red.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" it repeats until ""dax"" introduces green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif zup,"" the output is ""green green green red yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" green repeats until ""wif"" introduces red.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color immediately preceding it to repeat in the output until a different color word is encountered. 

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the last mentioned color to repeat.",-0.09364961953754901,135,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us examine the patterns associated with the word in each of the input/output pairs.

- In the first input/output pair, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to red. All instances of ""wif"" and ""dax"" that follow ""walm"" also translate to red. Before ""walm,"" ""dax"" translates to green and ""lug"" to blue.
- In the second input/output, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax."" Both of these translate to red, while ""dax"" without ""walm"" following it translates to green.
- In the third input/output pair, ""walm"" is preceded and followed by ""lug,"" translating both to blue.
- In the fourth input/output pair, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is then followed by ""dax"" and ""wif."" Subsequently, ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" after ""walm"" translate to yellow, while ""bluf"" translates to blue.
- Finally, in the fifth input/output pair, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""wif"" and ""zup."" Both ""wif"" and ""zup"" translate to green after ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow"". The word following ""bluf"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" caused ""blue"" to be repeated, but here only once.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green"". The word following ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"". The word ""bluf"" caused ""red"" to be repeated, but here only once.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue"". The word following ""bluf"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" caused ""blue"" to be repeated, but here only once.
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". The word following ""bluf"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"". The word ""bluf"" caused ""green"" to be repeated, but here only once.

The rule seems to vary in how many times the following color is repeated, between once and twice. However, since there is not enough information to deduce a pattern about the number of repetitions, we can only say for certain that ""bluf"" indicates repetition of the subsequent color at least once.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color word to be repeated at least once in the output.",-0.09292753816558823,136,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I'll examine the relationship between the input and output in each example:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Correspondence: zup -> yellow, wif -> red, walm -> red
   
2. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   Correspondence: zup -> yellow, lug -> blue
   
3. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green

   Correspondence: wif -> red, lug -> blue
   
5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   Correspondence: wif -> red, dax -> green

From these examples, it seems that the color immediately following the word ""bluf"" is repeated twice. Additionally, the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf"" is the color used for ""bluf.""

Thus, we can infer the rule for ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color corresponding to the word that comes after ""bluf,"" and the output for ""bluf"" itself is the color indicated by the word before it.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

- ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it multiple times.

Let's break down the examples to see how this rule applies:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - Following ""wif"", ""walm"" causes the output to be ""red"" repeated three times.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - Following ""zup"", ""walm"" causes the output to be ""yellow"" repeated three times.

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - Following ""lug"", ""walm"" causes the output to be ""blue"" repeated three times.

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - Following ""wif"", ""walm"" causes the output to be ""red"" repeated three times.

5. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - Following ""zup"", ""walm"" causes the output to be ""yellow"" repeated three times.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green and is followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

So, the rule is:
- ""walm"" -> repeats the color of the preceding word in the output three times.

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following about the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule:
- When ""walm"" follows a color word, the output is multiple instances of that color, specifically three or more times repeated.
- The colors are based on the following mappings:
  - dax -> green
  - wif -> red
  - zup -> yellow
  - lug -> blue

1. ""dax wif walm"" maps to ""green red red red"". ""Wif"" is before ""walm"" and the output is ""red"" three times.
2. ""zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" is before ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" three times.
3. ""wif dax lug walm"" maps to ""red green blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" is before ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" three times.
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" maps to ""green blue red red red"". ""Wif"" is before ""walm"" and the output is ""red"" three times.
5. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" maps to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"". Here, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""dax"", resulting in ""yellow"" three times before the ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"".

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

walm -> meaning. The rule is: Repeat the color word before ""walm"" three times in the output.",-0.09941915594377905,136,walm
"Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's examine the patterns in which ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red""
5. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""

In the outputs following ""walm,"" we see repetitions of the same color word multiple times. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in each input.

Let's relate the number of words to the number of repetitions for each case:

- In example 1, ""walm"" is preceded by 2 words (""dax wif""), and the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by 1 word (""zup""), and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is preceded by 3 words (""wif dax lug""), and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by 3 words (""dax lug wif""), and the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by words (""dax zup""), interrupting the pattern of repetitions seen previously.

It appears that ""walm"" causes the output of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times. However, in example 5, the pattern breaks where ""walm"" does not directly cause a repetition, suggesting that ""walm's"" effect is overwritten by words following it.

Considering this, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to repeat three times, unless ""walm"" is followed by additional words that disrupt this pattern.

Rule: Walm -> Causes the color word immediately preceding it to repeat three times.",-0.10421059642860468,136,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color: ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue. The word ""walm"" appears to produce a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The number of repetitions of the color seems to correlate to the number of times the word ""walm"" is mentioned immediately following the color-associated word.

Here is a breakdown according to the provided data:

- ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red,"" so ""walm"" following ""wif"" produces two additional ""red"" (total of three ""red"" for one ""wif"" followed by ""walm"").
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating ""walm"" following ""zup"" produces two additional ""yellow"" (total of three ""yellow"").
- ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" following ""lug"" produces two additional ""blue"" (total of three ""blue"").
- ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red,"" here ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" again produces two additional ""red.""
- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" indicating the sequence ""zup walm"" is consistent with previous examples producing two additional ""yellow.""

Following this pattern, ""walm"" used after a color word indicates that the color should be repeated two more times.

"Rule: walm -> the color attributed to the word that directly precedes 'walm' is repeated the number of times equivalent to the number of letters in that preceding word.

Explanation of Rule:

1. In the example ""dax wif walm"", 'wif' is the word preceding 'walm'. 'Wif' corresponds to the color red and has three letters. Thus, the output is one green (for 'dax') followed by 'red' repeated three times (for 'wif' with 'walm').

2. In the example ""zup walm"", 'zup' is the word preceding 'walm'. 'Zup' corresponds to the color yellow and has three letters. Thus, the output is 'yellow' repeated three times.

3. In the example ""wif dax lug walm"", 'lug' is the word preceding 'walm'. 'lug' corresponds to the color blue and has three letters. Thus, the output is red, green, and 'blue' repeated three times (for 'lug' with 'walm').

4. In the example ""dax lug wif walm"", 'wif' is again the word preceding 'walm'. Applying the same logic, the output is green, blue, followed by 'red' repeated three times.

5. In the example ""wif zup walm dax zup"", 'walm' is directly preceded by 'zup', which has three letters and corresponds to the color yellow. Thus, the output is red, 'yellow' repeated three times (for 'zup' with 'walm'), then green and yellow (following the colors of 'dax' and 'zup').

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax → Output: green green green yellow blue green

walm -> When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the preceding color to be repeated in the output.",-0.11161594731379001,137,walm
"Given the examples provided, we can infer the following patterns:

1. ""wif"" translates to ""red""
2. ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
3. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
4. ""dax"" translates to ""green""

With these translations established, observe how ""walm"" affects the output:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif lug,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" might result in a repetition of the color associated with the following word (""wif"" -> red) three times before continuing with the normal sequence.

- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""lug,"" where ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow"" and ""lug walm"" in ""blue blue blue."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes a thrice repetition of the color corresponding to the word following it (in these cases, ""zup"" -> yellow and ""lug"" -> blue).

- The fourth example with just ""dax walm"" leading to ""green green green"" also supports the repetition concept as there's no following color to influence, suggesting ""walm"" repeats the green from ""dax.""

- The fifth example ""dax lug walm zup wif"" provides the output ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". Here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and we observe ""blue"" repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it repeats the color of the word that follows it three times.

So, we can interpret ""walm"" as:

walm -> Repeat the color of the following word three times.",-0.5790885290388502,137,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, we can notice how ""walm"" influences the output:

1. Whenever ""walm"" follows a color word it outputs that color three times.
2. ""Walm"" seems to change the regular pattern of single color outputs to a repetition of one particular color.

Let's verify this with the provided samples:

- In Example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is outputted as ""yellow"", and as a result, we get ""yellow"" three times.
- In Example 2, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" and outputs ""yellow"" three times.
- In Example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is outputted as ""blue"" and it results in ""blue"" three times.
- In Example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is outputted as ""green"", resulting in ""green"" three times.
- In Example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and as established, outputs ""blue"" three times.

Considering this pattern, we can define ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color outputted for the preceding word three times.",-1.1911195840559996,137,walm
"Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the input sequence, the corresponding output sequence repeats the color word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. 

For example:

- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow. Accordingly, the output repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- In the second input, ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue) precedes ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated three times in the output.
- In the third input, we again see ""lug"" before ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times in the output following ""walm.""
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" which corresponds to green, so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth input, similar to the previous instances, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" hence ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""lug.""

Therefore, using the pattern deduced from the examples:
walm -> Repeats the color word immediately before it three times.",-1.2238942258579997,137,walm

"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs given.

1. Input: wif lug dax
   Output: red blue green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" must correspond to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" here corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - The second ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue""

3. Input: dax lug dax lug wif
   Output: green blue green blue red
   - The pattern for ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" from previous examples holds true here as well.

4. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   - The inconsistency here is with ""bluf,"" which previously corresponded to ""yellow,"" but now corresponds to ""red."" However, ""bluf"" is not the focus here—rather, it's the consistency of ""lug"" with ""blue.""

5. Input: wif dax lug dax
   Output: red green blue green
   - Again, the correspondence of ""dax"" and ""wif"" with ""green"" and ""red"" respectively remains, with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""

Based on the examples, the rule is consistent: every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Hence, the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.06911557930642637,138,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". We can observe that whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here are the observed mappings consistent with the examples:
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Let's verify this with the given examples:

Example 1:
Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green
Mapping: red (wif) blue (lug) green (dax)

Example 2:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Mapping: red (wif) [unknown pattern for zup and bluf] blue (lug) [unknown pattern for walm] green (dax) blue (lug)

Example 3:
Input: dax lug dax lug wif
Output: green blue green blue red
Mapping: green (dax) blue (lug) green (dax) blue (lug) red (wif)

Example 4:
Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red
Mapping: red (wif) [unknown pattern for bluf] blue (lug) green (dax) red (wif)

Example 5:
Input: wif dax lug dax
Output: red green blue green
Mapping: red (wif) green (dax) blue (lug) green (dax)

The rule that can be deduced from these examples is:
Rule: lug -> blue",-0.09056311674041052,138,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we can look at its occurrences and the output that correlates with its presence:

3. dax lug dax lug wif -> green blue green blue red
4. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
5. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green

Here is the analysis:

- In example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times.
- In example 3, ""lug"" again corresponds to the color ""blue"" each time it appears.
- In example 4, ""lug"" again matches with ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.09197564793172636,138,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"".
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"".
- ""lug"" must be determined in relation to these and other words.

Let's analyse each input-output pair:

In the first and fifth examples:
- Input: ""wif lug dax"" Output: ""red blue green""
- Input: ""wif dax lug dax"" Output: ""red green blue green""
We see that whenever ""lug"" comes after ""wif"", it translates to ""blue"", and when it comes after ""dax"", it remains ""blue"".

In the second example:
- Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, regardless of whether it comes after ""bluf"", ""walm"", or ""dax"".

In the third example:
- Input: ""dax lug dax lug wif"" Output: ""green blue green blue red""
Here, the position of ""lug"" after ""dax"" still corresponds to ""blue"", and it does not change before ""wif"".

In the fourth example:
- Input: ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" Output: ""red red blue green red""
We still find ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" when following ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", regardless of its position or the words around it.

In the second and third examples, ""walm"" appears at the end, and the color sequence that follows repeats the color related to the word that immediately precedes it.

In the fourth input where ""walm"" is between two words, the resulting color sequence repeats the color assigned to the word that follows ""walm.""

"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color.

Let's summarize the examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
2. dax zup lug -> green yellow blue
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. lug dax zup -> blue green yellow
5. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Let’s look at each term's meaning when it's not followed by ""zup"":

- dax -> green (examples 2, 4, and 5)
- wif -> red (example 5)
- lug -> blue (example 4)

By examining the pattern when ""zup"" is used, we can see that it always corresponds to the color ""yellow"":

- zup dax wif -> yellow green red
- dax zup lug -> green yellow blue
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- lug dax zup -> blue green yellow

In each case, regardless of its position, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". So, using that pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.18699148372756097,139,zup
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
- It does not seem to be dependent on the words around it, as it outputs ""yellow"" regardless of whether it is preceded by ""dax"", followed by ""lug"", or even when by itself with ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Therefore, the meaning of the word ""zup"" in this context is the color ""yellow.""

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is the last in the sequence of colors associated with the word before it.

Examples and Analysis:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   Analysis: The color associated with ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" following ""wif"" translates to red again. The word ""dax"" then translates to green.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Analysis: The color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" following ""zup"" translates to yellow again.

3. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red
   Analysis: The color associated with ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" following ""dax"" translates to green again. The word ""lug"" then translates to blue, and ""wif"" to red.

4. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   Analysis: The color associated with ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which means it translates to green again.

Therefore:
bluf -> The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.",-0.6505338361991023,139,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color immediately following its first mention. Here is the breakdown of how ""bluf"" seems to work:

- In the first example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and after ""lug bluf"" we see a pattern of ""blue"" repeated until another color is introduced with ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" ""Bluf"" seems to replicate the color before it.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and after ""wif bluf"" the output is ""red red."" Again, ""bluf"" replicates the color (""red"") that comes before it.
- In the third example, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and following ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" replicates the preceding color of ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and after ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green"" before the pattern changes with a new color ""lug"" which is ""blue."" ""Bluf"" follows the rule and replicates the ""green"" color before it.
- The fifth example shows ""wif"" for ""red,"" ""dax"" for ""green,"" and then ""bluf,"" which leads to another ""green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" replicates the ""green"" color before it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Replicates the color word mentioned directly before it.",-0.9624984627269233,139,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" dictates the color output of the word that immediately precedes it, rather than representing a specific color itself. The pattern is consistent across all examples. When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output color is the same as the one that would be output without the presence of ""bluf,"" but it is repeated. Here's the observed pattern for the words followed by ""bluf"":

- When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the color blue is repeated.
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the color red is repeated.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the color green is repeated.
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the color yellow is repeated.

Thus, bluf acts as a duplicator for the color associated with the preceding word. Here is the rule:

Rule: bluf -> Duplicates the color associated with the preceding word.",-1.0798569793905124,139,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to influence the output color, but not in a direct one-to-one manner. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to dictate that the output color should be the same as the color produced by the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""lug"" produces ""blue"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the next color is ""blue"" as well. 
- In the second example, ""wif"" produces ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf."" The output is ""red,"" matching the output for ""wif.""
- The third example shows ""zup"" producing ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the next color remains ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows, producing another ""green.""
- The fifth example reiterates the pattern with ""dax"" producing ""green"" and ""bluf"" following, resulting once again in ""green.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately prior to it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color output of the immediately preceding word.",-1.0997115674987177,139,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows each word. Here are the correlations:

- When paired with ""lug,"" ""bluf"" results in ""blue.""
- When paired with ""wif,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- When paired with ""dax,"" ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- When paired with ""zup,"" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""

However, looking at the pattern, one might notice that the color mentioned after ""bluf"" does not appear independently but instead seems to repeat the color of the word prior to ""bluf"". Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word.

Thus, one can deduce the rule as follows:

bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present in a sequence, the color that corresponds to the word before ""bluf"" in the sequence is repeated.",-1.1407000519210257,139,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm.""

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

We have the following associations:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

The word ""walm"" modifies each of the outputs in such a way that when it follows a word, it results in a repetition of that word's associated color three times (except when followed by another word, in which case the repetition is disrupted by the next word's associated color).

For example, after ""wif"" (which is ""red"") we get ""red red red"" when followed by ""walm."" Similarly, after ""dax"" (which is ""green"") we get ""green green green"" when followed by ""walm.""

Using the examples to derive the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word it follows to repeat three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Rule: When used after a word, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.07855237820083516,139,walm
"Observing the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm"":

- In ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"", the pattern of colors red, red, red, yellow, blue, red, red, red, yellow is associated with the words wif, walm, zup, lug, wif, walm, zup.
- ""wif walm"" correlates to red, red, red.
- In ""dax lug walm"", the pattern is green, blue, blue, blue.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" transforms into red, green, blue, blue, blue.
- Finally, ""lug zup dax walm"" becomes blue, yellow, green, green, green.

If we analyze the patterns, it seems that ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" consistently yield single colors: red, green, and blue, respectively. The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. The appearance of the word ""walm"" always results in the repetition of the color produced by the word immediately preceding it. 

Hence, the rule seems to be:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated.

Rule: If X color is associated with the word that precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" results in outputting X color again.",-0.18823279668423082,139,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the previously stated word multiple times. We can observe this in the given inputs and outputs:

1. In the first input ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and we see that ""walm"" following it results in ""red red red"". After that, ""zup"" translates to yellow, but ""lug"", which comes after ""zup"", corresponds to blue. Thus, ""walm"" doesn't strictly follow ""zup"" and doesn't transform ""zup"" into three yellows. However, after ""lug"", ""wif"" appears again followed by ""walm"", and ""walm"" again translates to ""red red red"".

2. The second input ""wif walm"" consists of only ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"", indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"".

3. The third input ""dax lug walm"" has ""dax"" translating to green and ""lug"" to blue. The ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" in the output, once again, repeating the color of the preceding word.

4. The fourth input ""wif dax lug walm"" has ""wif"" (red), ""dax"" (green), and ""lug"" (blue) with each color appearing once before ""walm"". After ""lug"", ""walm"" makes the output ""blue blue blue"".

5. The fifth example ""lug zup dax walm"" has ""lug"" (blue), ""zup"" (yellow), and ""dax"" (green). ""Walm"" only appears once after ""dax"" and in the output, ""green"" is repeated thrice.

Walm -> meaning. 

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes it three times.",-0.2350447920515385,139,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, we can deduce the following pattern:

- ""wif walm"" always results in ""red red red,"" which implies that regardless of what follows or precedes these two words, they will produce three reds.
- When ""walm"" is used at the end after different words like ""dax lug"" or ""lug zup dax,"" the output is a repetition of the color output of the word just before walm. For instance, ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue"" followed by ""blue blue blue,"" and since ""lug"" gives us ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to triple that output.

This leads to the conclusion that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color that is produced by the word directly before it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color in the output three times.",-0.8483117709352745,139,walm

"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""lug.""

In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with the word ""blue"":
Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

In the second example, ""lug"" appears first and is again translated to ""blue"":
Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red

The third example shows that ""lug"" followed by ""wif"" results in ""blue red"":
Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green blue red

The fourth example demonstrates ""lug"" being repeated and each instance of ""lug"" becoming ""blue"":
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue green blue red blue blue

In the fifth example, ""lug"" bookends ""zup"" and both instances are ""blue"" again:
Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be fairly straightforward:

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the series of nonce words. Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" is ""blue.""

lug -> blue",-0.3310537560356429,140,lug
"Based on the examples provided:

- In the first input, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""blue yellow"" in the output.
- In the second input, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue blue.""
- In the third input, ""lug"" is preceded by ""walm"" and followed by ""wif,"" with the output sequence ""green green blue red.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug"" appears twice, both times preceded and followed by words that translate to ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively.
- In the fifth input, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" and the sequence ""blue yellow blue"" is produced.

By looking at the instances of ""lug"" and their corresponding outputs in relation to neighboring words, we can infer the following rule:

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in its uses across the examples. Let's examine where ""dax"" is used and what color corresponds to it in the output.

1. Input: dax wif lug dax
   Output: green red blue green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both at the beginning and the end of the sequence.

2. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Here, ""dax"" is situated between ""wif"" and ""walm,"" and it corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: dax lug dax
   Output: green blue green

4. Input: dax lug zup dax
   Output: green blue yellow green
   Both instances of ""dax"" translate to ""green.""

5. Input: lug dax zup dax wif
   Output: blue green yellow green red
   ""dax"" is in the middle and corresponds to ""green"" in both instances.

Based on these examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.06590952123148375,140,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can see that the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input. Here are the mappings in each example:

1. dax wif lug dax -> green red blue green
2. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
3. dax lug dax -> green blue green
4. dax lug zup dax -> green blue yellow green
5. lug dax zup dax wif -> blue green yellow green red

In each case, ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green,""

Rule: dax -> green",-0.10406438842138377,140,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will analyze the relationship between the input and the corresponding output in each of the example sentences:

1. Input: dax wif lug dax 
   Output: green red blue green

From this, we can see that ""dax"" appears at both the beginning and the end of the sequence and corresponds to ""green"" in both cases. It's also important to note the other words correspond to specific colors: ""wif"" to red and ""lug"" to blue.

2. Input: zup wif dax walm 
   Output: yellow red green green green

Here, ""dax"" appears once and corresponds to ""green"" again. ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" is confirmed as red (as seen in the first example), and ""walm"" seems to produce two additional ""green"" outputs.

3. Input: dax lug dax 
   Output: green blue green

In this example, the presence of ""dax"" at the beginning and end again corresponds to ""green,"" with ""lug"" in the middle corresponding to ""blue."" This reinforces our initial observations from the first example.

4. Input: dax lug zup dax 
   Output: green blue yellow green

Here, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" at both the beginning and the end of the sequence. ""lug"" is once more ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" as in the second example.

5. Input: lug dax zup dax wif 
   Output: blue green yellow green red

This sequence confirms that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Based on the above examples, we can consistently see that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" has a repeated ""green"" in the output, possibly because ""walm"" equates to repeating the last color mentioned twice

- The third example shows ""dax"" at the beginning and end with ""green"" as well.
- The fourth and fifth examples also show ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" as follows:

In the first example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Since ""zup"" is consistently translated as ""yellow"" and ""wif"" as ""red"" in other examples as well, it can be inferred that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the second example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" must correspond to ""yellow"" as it is the only word not accounted for, and the only color in the output not yet associated with a word is ""yellow.""

In the third example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" As ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" must once again correspond to ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" translates to ""green green red blue yellow"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the output has ""green"" following another ""green,"" ""bluf"" must correspond to ""green.""

In the fifth example, ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red.” Here, ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Bluf"" must correspond to ""green"" as it comes right after ""dax"" and is followed by ""green"" in the output.

From these deductions, it can be surmised that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it represents the color immediately preceding it in the series, so ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately preceding it.",-0.07799933954832941,140,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the inputs with their respective outputs and look for patterns.

- In the first and third examples, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Since ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" might also translate to ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf wif lug zup"" translates to ""green red blue yellow."" If we consider the translations of ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" as ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and ""dax"" translates to ""green"" as seen in other examples, then ""bluf"" preceding ""wif"" might imply a repetition of the color stated after, which is ""red"" in this case.

- In the second example, ""lug zup bluf"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow."" Comparing this with the translations of ""lug"" and ""zup,"" it reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" could mean a repetition of the preceding color, ""yellow"" in this case.

Looking at all the examples provided:
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it results in ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it results in ""green blue.""
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow yellow.""

From the patterns, we can induce that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color indicated by the word that follows it or it directly repeats the same color it represents when it is the last color mentioned.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in each example, especially those involving the word in question. Let's analyze each instance and see what comes before and after ""bluf.""

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"" and produces ""red red."" ""Bluf"" does not seem to affect the output's color immediately following it, which is just a repetition of ""wif""'s output color.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and produces ""yellow"" after ""zup."" Notice that ""bluf"" generates ""yellow,"" but ""zup"" also produces ""yellow"" in other contexts, suggesting ""bluf"" might simply repeat the previous color.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" again produces ""red red"" following ""wif,"" consistent with the first example.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif lug zup,"" and after ""bluf,"" the sequence of colors is ""red blue yellow,"" which corresponds with the colors for ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup,"" respectively. This again suggests that ""bluf"" might cause a repetition of a previous color (which was ""green"" before it).
- In the fifth example, after ""bluf,"" the colors are ""green blue red,"" which match ""dax lug wif."" ""Bluf"" has produced ""green,"" the same color as ""dax"" before it.

From these observations, we can induce the likely rule for ""bluf"":

Therefore:

bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word.",-0.8040295486802356,140,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to each input where ""bluf"" is present:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output sequence contains ""red"" twice in a row.
- The words before or after ""bluf"" don't seem to affect the occurrence of the double ""red.""
- The examples provided do not suggest that ""bluf"" directly corresponds to a specific color (as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" based on other examples).

Given these observations, we can deduce the following:

bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" in the input is represented by the double occurrence of ""red"" in the output.

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it is translated into ""red red"" in the output sequence.",-1.3320690995235298,140,bluf
"Observing the outputs associated with the inputs where ""bluf"" appears, we can understand that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to two reds in a sequence within the output:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" results in ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow yellow,"" which are the colors associated with ""zup,"" indicating that the ""bluf"" beforehand also produced a duplication, here it's ""red red.""
- Examples three, four, and five also support this duplication pattern when ""bluf"" precedes ""red,"" it is followed by another ""red.""

It is important to determine if ""bluf"" is generating the ""red"" color itself or causing duplication of a preceding color. In all instances of ""bluf,"" it produces ""red red."" If ""bluf"" were causing duplication, we would expect it to duplicate a color other than ""red"" when it follows another color, but this does not occur. Hence, we deduce that ""bluf"" itself contributes to the occurrence of ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red red"" (bluf generates two reds in sequence).",-1.3819164607823533,140,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

In the first example, ""lug dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green green red."" Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" following it results in two additional ""green""s.

In the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in two more ""green""s.

The third example, ""zup walm wif,"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" following it results again in two additional ""yellow""s.

In the fourth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" we have ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" Here ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" from ""zup"" two more times, in the sequence.

In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" after ""zup"" again results in two additional ""yellow""s.

- In the sequence ""dax walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" and so ""walm"" results in the output ""green"" repeating.

"To determine the rule for ""bluf"", we should look for the pattern in the input and corresponding output to see how ""bluf"" is translated each time. By comparing the position of ""bluf"" in the input to its translation in the output, we can try to identify a consistent rule.

5th Example:
Input: dax walm wif bluf

""bluf"" translates to ""red""

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" does not translate to a single consistent color. Instead, its translation seems dependent on other factors such as its position or the context provided by the other words. 

One possible pattern is that ""bluf"" might be repeating the color translated from the word that precedes it:
- In the 1st example, it follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" itself is translated to ""yellow"".
- In the 2nd example, it follows ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", so ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- In the 3rd example, it first follows ""lug"" (translated to ""blue"") and is translated to ""blue""; it then follows ""zup"" (translated to ""yellow"") and translates to ""yellow"".
- In the 4th example, it follows ""wif"", translating to ""red"" and making ""bluf"" also ""red"".
- In the 5th example, it follows ""wif"", translating to ""red"" again.

According to the above observations, the tentative rule for ""bluf"" could be that it repeats the translation of the word immediately before it.

Let's look at the examples:

1. In Example 1, every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The singular instance of ""bluf"" at the end corresponds to a double ""yellow"".

2. In Example 2, there is a pattern where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""blue"" and then ""red"". The ""bluf"" again results in a double ""red"".

3. In Example 3, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"" at the end of the sequence. Both instances of ""bluf"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" in this sequence.

4. In Example 4, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The ""bluf"" is followed by a double ""red"".

5. In Example 5, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Bluf"" corresponds to a double ""red"".

However, to be consistent with all examples, we can note that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or when it's the last word in the sequence, it results in ""red"" being repeated regardless of the preceding word.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: 
If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or is the last word, then output ""red"" twice.

- In examples 2, 4, and 5, whenever ""wif"" or ""walm"" precedes ""bluf,"" it is always followed by the color ""red.""

Therefore, it seems there's a rule for ""bluf"" that is context-dependent:

"Based on the examples provided and the correlation between the input and output, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to the color red when it is in the output.

Here's the breakdown:

- In example 1, between ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" corresponds to red.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" appears twice, both times corresponding to red.
- In example 3, after ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" appears corresponding to red.
- In example 4, immediately after ""dax"" (green), ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" appears at the end, after ""lug"" (blue), corresponding to blue at the end.

However, upon reevaluating examples 4 and 5, it's clear that my initial assessment was incorrect, because ""bluf"" corresponds to green in example 4 and blue in example 5, not red as initially concluded from the other examples. 

Upon closer inspection, when ""bluf"" occurs immediately after ""dax"" (green) it is also green, and when it occurs after ""lug"" (blue), it is also blue. This indicates ""bluf"" tends to mimic the color of the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

- In every instance of ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- ""Bluf"" never co-occurs with a color other than ""red"" in the output.
- There is no variation in the output when ""bluf"" appears in the input, regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be straightforward:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color that the word before ""walm"" represents three times. We can verify this rule by looking at the examples in detail:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug,"" therefore, appears to represent the color blue, and since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in three blue outputs.
- In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"". Both instances of ""wif walm"" lead to repeating ""red"" three times, indicating that ""wif"" represents red and ""walm"" makes it repeat thrice.
- The third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"", translates to ""red red green green green"". Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to ""green"" being repeated three times, suggesting that ""dax"" represents green and ""walm"" causes the repetition.
- The fourth example, ""lug walm zup wif"", translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red"". Again, ""lug walm"" results in three ""blue"" outputs, supporting the rule.
- Finally, the fifth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"", translates to ""green green green red red"". The ""dax walm"" leads to the output ""green"" repeated thrice, while the following ""wif bluf"" sequence changes the colors, further supporting that ""walm"" by itself causes the repetition of the previous color.

3. ""dax"" seems to be independent of the context that comes after it, as it remains ""green"" regardless of the following words.

Example 1: wif dax zup wif dax bluf

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- The sequence ends with ""dax bluf"", and the corresponding output ends with ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"".

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", followed by ""bluf"" which also corresponds to ""green"", repeating the color of ""dax"".

Example 3: lug wif bluf

"To discover the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in the provided examples. Let’s analyze the output colors relative to the position of ""walm"" and its surrounding words.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   
2. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   
3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
4. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   
5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can deduce the following color associations for single words:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Now let’s look specifically at the outputs whenever ""walm"" appears:

- In every example, the word ""walm"" generates an output where the color of the word that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times. For example, in the first input, ""dax"" is green, so the output for ""dax walm"" is green repeated three times.
- The color that follows ""walm"" is not consistent and depends on the following word. Hence, ""walm"" doesn’t appear to affect the color that comes after it.

Based on this analysis:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.09245271752052175,145,walm
"Based on the given input and output patterns, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Each regular word seems to have a fixed color associated with it: ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is red. When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color of the preceding word is repeated according to the number of times ""walm"" occurs.

Here is the rule based on the examples:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which means ""walm"" corresponds to repeating green two more times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" corresponds to repeating blue two more times.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which means ""walm"" corresponds to repeating red two more times.
- ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green,"" which means after green (dax), ""walm"" repeats green three times.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and blue is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word an additional number of times equal to the occurrences of ""walm"" plus one.",-0.4667999470253263,145,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the outputs in relation to the placement of ""walm"" in the inputs and the corresponding sequences of colors.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green yellow.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. When ""walm"" is used after ""wif,"" it leads to ""red red red.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug dax,"" it results in ""green green green.""
5. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup dax lug,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""

In every instance, the word ""walm"" seems to extend the previous color by repeating it three times before a new color, possibly indicated by the next word, is given (for example ""zup"" yields yellow after ""walm""). If ""walm"" is the final word in the sequence, it simply repeats the previous color three times without introducing a new color.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the last color three times.

- If ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   - The word ""wif"" appears three times and is interspaced with ""dax"" and ""lug,"" corresponding to three occurrences of ""red""
   - Between two ""wif"" words lies ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color, which in this case is ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" However, in example 2, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" which results in the repetition of ""green,"" although from the rest of the examples, the repetition seems to be more tied to the presence of ""walm"" than ""dax.""

Therefore, we can determine the following:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

dax -> green",-0.08560276354187654,146,dax
"To determine the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" let's carefully consider the given examples and their corresponding outputs. It seems that each word in the input relates to a specific color in the output:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green green green""
- ""dax"" appears in various positions relative to other words.

Now, let's examine each instance where ""dax"" appears:

1. lug wif dax -> blue red green
2. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
3. lug dax wif -> blue green red
4. wif dax wif lug wif -> red green red blue red
5. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green

Looking at where ""dax"" occurs and the corresponding output, the following observations can be made:

- Whenever ""dax"" occurs, the color ""green"" appears in the output.
- ""dax"" appears to represent a single color, as it corresponds to one color word in the output.
- ""dax"" does not seem to affect the colors indicated by the other words.

Given the above, it seems that the simplest consistent rule is that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green",-0.09836417235834567,146,dax
"From the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue.""
2. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""
3. The word ""walm"" when following another word that is not ""dax"" corresponds to a repetition of the previous color in the output.
4. The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

From this analysis, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" outputs the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.",-1.0459700802756788,146,dax

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words. Each other word in the sequence corresponds to a unique color: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""dax"" corresponds to green; ""lug"" corresponds to blue.",-0.6524858036721313,146,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" and its associated color output through pattern recognition:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- The presence of other words such as ""zup"" and ""dax"" results in other colors (""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively) appearing in the output. Since these colors are consistent when these words appear, we can assume that like ""wif"", these words also correspond to specific colors.

Now, let’s construct the rule:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue

However, noting that bluf also maps to yellow, we may assume that bluf and zup may be interchangeable or contextually dependent on one another. Walm does not have an independent mapping but is associated with zup to yield the output ""yellow."" This pattern indicates that ""walm"" may not affect the translation directly.

Based on these mappings, the rule appears to be the direct translation of words to colors, where ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to cause the preceding word to be repeated in the form of a specific color. Each unique word preceding ""bluf"" is associated with a color, as seen in the examples:

- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" so ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green,"" so ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""zup bluf"" in the context of ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue,"" so ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a command to translate the preceding word into its associated color and then repeat that color.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine its usage in various contexts:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
4. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
5. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue

From the above examples, we can see that ""walm"" is followed by repetition of preceding colors:

1. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" we see ""blue blue blue"".
2. ""zup"" presumably corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue; after ""walm"" we see a repetition of blue (corresponding to ""lug"" which comes just before ""walm"").
4. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red; after ""walm"" the red color is repeated three times.
5. Both ""dax"" and ""lug"" stand for colors, but only ""lug"" (blue) is repeated after ""walm"".

We can deduce that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Since the number of repetitions and which color gets repeated varies (sometimes the color that has a more frequent occurrence is not repeated), it's challenging to ascertain an exact pattern. However, the most consistent observation is that ""walm"" causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated. The number of repetitions seems inconsistent and might be related to the positions of the color words or other factors not explicitly obvious in the data provided.

Rule: Walm -> causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated an uncertain number of times.",-0.11206630787358693,146,walm
"Observing the patterns from the inputs and outputs provided, it seems that ""walm"" is tied to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. However, each instance ends with a switch away from this pattern at the end of the output, to a different color associated with another word in the input (possibly the word following ""walm"" if it exists). Let's look at the given examples:

1. In ""lug walm wif bluf"", ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""walm"" seems to indicate repeating ""blue"" until the end where ""wif"" is introduced with ""red"". Therefore, ""walm"" perhaps means to repeat the previous color, until a change is introduced at the end with ""red"" related to ""wif"".

2. In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" again repeats this color with only ""yellow"" as the output.

3. In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"", it seems that ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" associated with ""lug"", and then the pattern is broken by ""green"" associated with ""dax"", followed by ""red"" for ""wif"".

4. In ""lug wif walm"", ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" and then ""wif"" by ""red"", with ""walm"" repeating ""red"" until the end.

5. In ""dax lug dax lug walm"", the colors associated with ""dax"" and ""lug"" are ""green"" and ""blue"", respectively, but ""walm"" only repeats ""blue"".

From these examples, we can deduce a rule:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" until the sequence is ended or a new color word is introduced to signal a change. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input, repeat the last color word's associated color.

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it a certain number of times. From the examples:

- In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""lug"" results in one mention of ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in repeating ""blue"" three times.
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" outputs one ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times before the pattern continues with other words and colors.
- In ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""red"" being repeated three times.
- In ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""blue"" three times. There is consistency in the amount of repetition.

Notice all occurrences of ""walm"" result in a thrice repetition of the color word that came immediately before it, no matter what the color is. So:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color mentioned before it three times.",-0.6168629245190543,146,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be linked to the word that precedes it. Here's the rule that can be derived from the examples:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is three instances of the word ""blue"". See the first and fourth examples for reference.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is three instances of the word ""yellow"". This can be observed in the second example.
- When ""dax lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is four instances of the word ""blue"", as seen in the third and fifth examples.

Given this, ""walm"" seems to output a specific number of a color, dependent on the preceding word(s). The specific number is consistent for any given input word.

walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" follows a specific word or a specific combination of words, it results in a fixed number of repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word(s). Here's a summary of the rules observed:

- ""lug walm"" -> three instances of ""blue""
- ""zup walm"" -> three instances of ""yellow""
- ""dax lug walm"" -> four instances of ""blue""
- ""lug wif walm"" -> three instances of ""red"" (assuming ""wif"" signals ""red"" in this context as ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"")

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" from the examples provided, we must look for patterns that correlate with the output colors. Here's the breakdown of each input and the respective output:

1. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
2. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
3. wif dax -> red green
4. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
5. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green

First, let's identify any patterns with common words:

- Every time ""dax"" appears first in the string, the first color in the output is green.
- Every instance of ""wif"" after the first word results in red.
- The color blue seems to be associated with the word ""lug"".
- Green is tied to ""dax"" unless it is preceded by ""wif"".

Now let's examine the color pattern associated specifically with ""dax"":

- When ""dax"" is the first word, the output color is green.
- When ""dax"" is used after ""wif"", the color immediately following is green.
- When ""dax"" is used as the last word after ""wif"", the color immediately preceding ""dax"" is red.

The rules for ""dax"" seem to be:

- ""dax"" at the beginning of a sequence correlates with the color green.
- ""dax"" immediately following ""wif"" correlates with the color green.
- ""dax"" at the end of the sequence doesn't necessarily correlate with the color green if another rule takes precedence (such as ""wif"" before it resulting in red).

Let's see if these patterns hold up:

Example 1: ""dax"" is at the start and end of the sequence. Both instances cause the color green, except for the ""dax"" following a ""wif"", which doesn't impact the ""dax"" being green.
Example 2: ""dax"" at the start equals green, ""wif"" results in red afterwards.
Example 4: ""dax"" leads to green, and the ""wif"" at the end makes it red.
Example 5: ""wif"" before ""dax"" doesn't stop ""dax"" from being green.

Given all of these observations, it seems that the rule for ""dax"" might be:

Rule: ""dax"" generally correlates with the color green, except if ""wif"" precedes it immediately.

However, this rule is not perfectly consistent since the output for ""wif dax"" is red green instead of just green. There could be an additional overarching rule that affects ""dax"" in relation to ""wif"" or other words. With the given information, the most consistent determination is:

Rule: ""dax"" correlates with the color green except when preceded by ""wif"", where ""wif"" takes precedence and correlates with red.",-0.09954377554561904,147,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" I'll examine the given examples and the corresponding output colors.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
Observation: The first and last instance of ""dax"" are matched with green while the ""wif"" that is located between two ""dax"" is red.

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green blue red yellow blue
Observation: Here ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" is blue, ""wif"" that is not between two ""dax"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""lug"" is blue.

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
Observation: ""wif"" that is not followed by ""dax"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
Observation: ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" and ""bluf"" are blue, and ""wif"" that is not between two ""dax"" is red.

Input: wif dax lug dax
Output: red green blue green
Observation: ""wif"" not followed by ""dax"" is red, the first ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and the second ""dax"" is green as well.

Based on these observations, we can see that ""dax"" is consistent with green in the output unless it is influencing the color of other words like ""wif."" When ""wif"" is directly between two ""dax,"" it turns red, which is different from when ""wif"" is not between ""dax"" or not followed by ""dax"" (it also turns red). There is no set rule for how ""dax"" affects ""wif"" since ""wif"" remains red whether it is between two ""dax"" or not.

A potential rule might be that ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.21748014023245235,147,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can analyze the positions where it appears and the corresponding output colors. Here are the observations from the examples:

1. When ""dax"" is at the start of a sequence, the corresponding color is green.
2. When ""dax"" is at the end of a sequence, the corresponding color is green.
3. When ""dax"" is in the middle of a sequence, the corresponding color varies, but it's never red unless it is directly followed by ""wif.""

From point 3, one can assume that ""dax"" has a special interaction with the word ""wif."" We can look into the “dax wif” combinations:

- In example 1, ""dax wif dax"" results in ""green red green,"" which suggests that ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red,"" while ""dax"" alone at the end of the sequence is green.
- In example 2, ""dax bluf wif"" results in ""green blue red,"" while ""dax"" and ""bluf"" on their own are green and blue, respectively. It indicates that the presence of ""wif"" following ""dax"" changes the color associated with ""dax"" from green to red.
- In example 3, ""wif dax"" results in ""red green."" Here ""dax"" is not followed by ""wif,"" so it's simply green.
- In example 4, ""dax lug bluf wif"" results in ""green blue blue red."" In this sequence, “dax” is followed by “lug” and it is green; the ""wif"" at the end is red, and it doesn't affect the ""dax"" because they are not consecutive.
- In example 5, ""wif dax lug dax"" results in ""red green blue green."" Here ""dax"" is not directly followed by ""wif,"" so it is green, regardless of where it appears in the sequence.

Based on these observations, one possible rule is:
- ""dax"" on its own, that is, not directly followed by ""wif,"" corresponds to the color green.
- When “dax” is followed by ""wif,"" the resulting color for ""dax"" is red.

Rule: ""dax"" means green except when followed by ""wif,"" in which case ""dax"" means red.",-0.916517335606667,147,dax
"In order to deduce the meaning or rule applicable to the nonce word ""dax,"" let us compare the positions of ""dax"" and the corresponding output color across the examples:

1. In the first example, when ""dax"" appears twice, their corresponding colors are green and red.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green while the word right after it, ""bluf,"" corresponds to blue.
3. In the third example, the single instance of ""dax"" corresponds to green again.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by two words that correspond to blue and ends with ""wif"" corresponding to red.
5. In the fifth example, two instances of ""dax"" correspond to green, while the word between them, ""lug,"" corresponds to blue.

Upon examining these examples, we can observe the following patterns:
- ""dax"" mostly corresponds to green, except when it appears before ""wif,"" in which case ""dax"" turns red.
- ""lug"" always corresponds to blue.
- ""bluf"" always corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" always corresponds to red, regardless of its position.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow when following ""wif.""

Based on these observed patterns, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

dax -> meaning: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green unless directly followed by the word ""wif,"" in which case it corresponds to the color red.

Rule: If ""dax"" is followed by any word other than ""wif,"" then dax corresponds to green. If ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""wif,"" then dax corresponds to red.",-1.1069556437026187,147,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the color output associated with the word ""dax"" changes according to its position in the sentence. To deduce the rule, let's examine the output for ""dax"" in each example:

- In the first example, ""dax"" at positions 1 and 4 corresponds to ""green"" and then ""red"" output colors.
  
- In the second example, ""dax"" at position 1 corresponds to ""green"" while ""wif"" at position 3 corresponds to ""red"".
  
- In the third example, ""dax"" at position 2 corresponds to ""green"" while ""wif"" at position 1 corresponds to ""red"".
  
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" at position 1 corresponds to ""green"" while ""wif"" at the last position corresponds to ""red"".
  
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" at position 2 and 4 corresponds to ""green"" while ""wif"" at position 1 corresponds to ""red"".

Based upon this information, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When ""dax"" is the first word in the sequence, it corresponds to ""green"". If ""dax"" appears in any other position, it seems to correspond to the color of the last instance ""wif"" appeared in, which is ""red"" in all given examples. This gives us:

dax -> meaning.

- At the beginning of the sequence: ""green"".
- At any other position: ""red"" due to the immediately preceding ""wif"".",-1.4996413286661905,147,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" does not change meaning dependent on the context, as it remains constant in all input examples. It appears before any other word in the input, suggesting that it could serve as an initial trigger for the subsequent color-naming rule. Moreover, ""wif"" itself corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output since ""red"" is the first color mentioned in each sequence, aligning with the ""wif"" being the first word in each input.

The subsequent words seem to determine the other colors. For instance, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""red,"" then a ""green"" when ""dax"" follows.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should analyze its context within each of the examples provided and see how it correlates with the output.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, we can notice that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is also ""red.""

- In the second example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" From this, we can deduce that ""bluf"" in the context of just ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" again translates to ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Here, ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

By comparing the inputs with their outputs, we can come up with a potential rule for ""bluf"":

When ""bluf"" appears directly after another word, it takes the same color as the word before it.

To validate this, we check each input and output to see if this rule applies:

- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which matches the rule.
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" which also matches the rule.
- ""lug bluf"" isn't directly given, but from ""lug bluf wif"" translating to ""blue blue red,"" we can still infer that ""bluf"" mirrors ""lug"" and results in ""blue.""
- In the context where ""bluf"" does not follow a word, such as standalone ""bluf"" or at the beginning of the sequence, this rule cannot be applied due to a lack of such examples.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes the same color as the word before it.",-0.12637261545091952,147,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for a pattern in each instance where it appears:

- zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- dax bluf -> green green
- lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

In each case, the word immediately following ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding ""bluf."" For example, in ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" which is the color of ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word before it.",-0.14119119482482756,147,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each input and its corresponding output, looking for patterns associated specifically with the presence of ""bluf.""

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is present with ""zup"" and ""wif walm."" The output is two yellows followed by three reds. Since ""wif walm"" translates to three reds, we can reason by elimination that ""zup bluf"" corresponds to two yellows.
- In the second example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to a green, followed by two yellows. We already sensed that ""zup bluf"" might mean two yellows, supporting the findings from the first example. ""Dax,"" therefore, likely equates to green.
- The third example, ""dax bluf,"" results in two greens. We previously deduced ""dax"" as green, which implies ""bluf"" is also green when alone with ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to a pattern that starts with blue, has two appearances of red related to ""wif,"" and ends with blue. ""lug"" occurs three times and corresponds to the three occurrences of blue in the output. Hence, ""bluf"" is once again between two colors corresponding to ""lug,"" which is blue.
- Finally, the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup,"" translates to red, red, blue, yellow. We know ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and ""zup"" is yellow. Thus, ""bluf"" is red this time, situated between red and blue.

Now, let's consolidate our findings:

- When ""bluf"" is combined with ""zup,"" the output is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is combined with ""dax,"" the output is green.
- When ""bluf"" is combined with ""lug,"" the output is blue.
- When ""bluf"" is standalone or not combined explicitly with the above colors, it appears to take on the color of ""wif"" (red).

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it unless it is combined with ""wif,"" where it defaults to red. There's not enough information to determine what happens if ""bluf"" appears at the beginning of a sequence or if it's the only word in the sequence. Therefore, the word ""bluf"" seems to represent a chameleon-like behavior, mimicking the color value of the word it follows.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes on the color of the preceding word, defaults to red if preceded by ""wif"".",-0.3960544569049425,147,bluf
"Observing the patterns and how the word ""bluf"" affects the output in the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated. Here's how the rule applies to the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and when ""bluf"" follows, there's an additional ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", and again, ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" causes ""green"" to be repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", resulting in ""blue"" repeating in the output. This pattern continues with the repetition of ""red"" after ""wif"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""red"" repeats, and when ""lug"" precedes ""zup"", ""blue"" and ""yellow"" colors follow accordingly without repetition because ""bluf"" does not follow immediately after ""lug"" or ""zup"".

Based on the pattern observed in the examples above, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat itself once in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" is related to color repetition and possibly to the word that precedes it. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - Here, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"". After ""walm"", the color green is repeated three times.
   - ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm"", and following that ""walm"", the color is repeated thrice, implying that ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" is ""blue"" and it does not have ""walm"" after it, hence it's represented only once.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" is ""red"" and appears twice, despite having no ""walm"" behind it.
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times.
   - ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" makes ""red"" appear three times.

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""zup"" starts with ""yellow"", but no repetition follows as there's no ""walm"".
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated thrice.
   - ""wif"" and ""dax"" stand alone so each is represented once.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following general rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be output three times.

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times.

Examining the provided examples:

- In ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to a single green, followed by ""walm,"" which results in two more greens (""green green green""); then ""zup"" leads to a single yellow, followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two more yellows (""yellow blue blue blue"").
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the sequence starts with red red followed by a single green from ""dax,"" and ""walm"" duplicates it twice (""green green green"").
- In ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" generates a single blue, and ""walm"" repeats it twice. ""zup"" gives a single yellow, followed by ""walm"" for two additional yellows.
- In ""wif walm,"" the term ""wif"" corresponds to a single red, and ""walm"" repeats this color two more times.
- In ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" ""zup"" leads to yellow, followed by ""lug"" with a single blue, and ""walm"" repeats blue twice. ""wif"" results in a red, followed by ""dax,"" which gives a single green.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided.

- In the first example, after ""dax walm,"" the word ""green"" is repeated three times. However, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the sequence is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green green green"" once again.
- The third example shows that ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and after ""zup,"" it is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the fifth example, we see different precedents: ""wif dax"" leads to ""red green,"" and ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" while ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the following color to be repeated three times, and the color that is repeated is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Let's detail this pattern:

- After ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
- After ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- After ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- After ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Thus, ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the next color three times,"" with the specific color to repeat being signaled by the word before ""walm.""

"By analyzing the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" acts as a multiplier for the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. The number of times the color is repeated in the output corresponds to the number of times the word ""walm"" appears after the color word. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first input, the word ""lug"" which is associated with blue occurs before ""walm,"" which results in ""blue blue blue"" in the output. The second instance is ""dax"" associated with green before ""walm,"" resulting in ""green green green."" Following the pattern, ""zup"" is associated with yellow and the next word is ""walm,"" which results in ""yellow blue blue blue.""
- In the second input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and yields ""green green green"" in the output.
- In the third input, ""lug"" again precedes ""walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup"" before ""walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the fifth input, the sequence ""zup lug walm"" indicates that ""lug"" should be multiplied according to ""walm"", resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" and then the sequence continues normally with ""wif"" representing red and ""dax"" representing green.

Based on the examples above, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> causes the preceding color word's corresponding color to be repeated three times.
",-0.8116625254758064,147,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should first identify any patterns in the provided input-output pairs. The number of times ""walm"" is mentioned in the input seems to correspond with a repetition in color in the output, and this color often follows the color associated with the word just before ""walm."" However, we need to figure out how many times the color is repeated based on the use of ""walm.""

Analyzing the input-output pairs:

1. After ""dax"" which corresponds to green and before ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of green three times before changing to blue. 
2. After ""dax"" (green) and before no following color, ""walm"" causes a repetition of green two more times.
3. After ""lug"" (blue) and before ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" causes a repetition of blue three times before changing to yellow.
4. After ""wif"" (red) and with no following color, ""walm"" seems to repeat red two more times.
5. After ""lug"" (blue) and before ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" causes blue to repeat three more times.

So it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to be repeated two more times if no following word is provided within the sequence, or three more times if a new color word follows. The only part that's not perfectly consistent is the sequence ""zup lug walm wif dax"" - the pattern breaks slightly as, according to the rule, we would expect one more blue.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the output by repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" When ""walm"" is not preceded by any word, it does not have any effect, as seen in the third and fourth examples. It's important to note that the color repetition includes the color associated with ""walm"" itself, meaning ""walm"" seems to take on the color value of the word before it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears plus one (for the ""walm"" itself).

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
- ""dax"" is associated with green;
- ""walm"" makes the green repeat two more times (""walm"" itself is green + one additional green);
- ""wif"" is associated with red.

2. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
- ""dax"" is associated with green;
- ""walm"" makes the green repeat two more times (""walm"" itself is green + one additional green).

3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
- ""lug"" is associated with blue;
- ""walm"" makes the blue repeat two times (""walm"" itself is blue + one additional blue).

4. wif walm -> red red red
- ""wif"" is associated with red;
- ""walm"" makes the red repeat two times (""walm"" itself is red + one additional red).

5. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow;
- ""walm"" makes the yellow repeat two times (""walm"" itself is yellow + one additional yellow);
- ""lug"" is associated with blue;
- ""wif"" is associated with red;
- ""bluf"" is likely a typo for ""wif"" since the example sticking to the repetition rule implies that ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red"", suggesting ""bluf"" is equivalent to ""wif.""

From these examples, ""walm"" -> rule-based repetition of the preceding color value, including itself.",-0.10819351283746836,150,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to replicate the color associated with the word that comes before it. Specifically, the output repeats the color associated with the preceding word as many times as the word ""walm"" indicates, before resuming any subsequent color associations for words that follow.

Here are the associations derived from the examples:
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Keeping that in mind, let's deduce the rule for ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""lug dax walm wif,"" the output is blue, green, green, green, red. Since ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with the color green, ""walm"" causes the color green to repeat three times before moving on to ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the second example, ""zup dax walm,"" we see yellow, green, green, green. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and repeats the green color three times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm,"" the output is blue, blue, blue. ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and repeats the color three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm,"" the output is red, red, red. ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and repeats the color three times.
- In the last example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" the output is yellow, yellow, yellow, blue, red, red. Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and repeats the color three times, then it continues with ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red), which is then red again, possibly due to ""bluf"" being a variation of ""wif"" (red) or simply an insurance that the color is repeated once.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Note: The number 'three' is derived from the given examples, and the rule is assumed to be consistent with these inputs. Changes in the number of repetitions or context may alter this rule.",-0.10969825318007594,150,walm
"By examining the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm."" Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. We see that when ""walm"" is present, there is a repetition of a color in the output. The color that is repeated is always associated with the word preceding ""walm.""

2. In the first example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" suggesting that whatever ""dax"" translates to, ""walm"" causes a repetition of that color.

3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" affirming that ""lug"" means blue and ""walm"" causes the blue color to repeat.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" further supporting the idea that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word right before it to repeat.

5. Finally, in the last example, we can see that ""zup walm lug"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here ""zup"" must mean yellow, and ""walm"" causes its repetition; when we get to ""lug,"" the color changes to blue (as established earlier), and ""wif"" follows the same pattern changing the color to red.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's start by examining each example and looking for patterns.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

By examining the outputs where ""walm"" appears and the colors represented before and after, we can try to establish a relationship between ""walm"" and the colors. We can notice that every time ""walm"" appears, there are three identical colors that follow it. In the first input, it is followed by three reds, and in the last input, it is followed by three greens and then three blues. When there is a color mentioned directly before ""walm,"" that color is repeated three times right after ""walm.""

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of three of the same color that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm -> means repeat the immediately preceding color three times.",-0.05934465078246078,151,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine each instance it appears and its corresponding output pattern:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""red"" outputs followed by ""lug,"" which gives ""blue"".

2. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - In this example, ""walm"" again corresponds to three repeats of the color given before it (""blue blue blue"") and then is followed by the color corresponding to ""wif,"" which is ""yellow"".

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and it again results in three ""blue"" outputs.

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - In this example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and as before, ""walm"" translates to three repetitions of the preceding color (""green"").

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - Similar to the prior examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" resulting in three ""green"" outputs, then ""walm"" occurs again after ""lug"" (""blue"") and results in three ""blue"" outputs.

From these observations, the rule appears to be: ""walm"" causes the color of the word that comes before it to repeat three times in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the occurrences of the nonce word ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs to deduce its meaning or rule.

Example 1:

Example 4:
Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Example 5:
Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

From these examples, we can observe the following:
- When ""walm"" occurs, the following color in the output sequence is repeated multiple times.
- The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of occurrences of ""walm"" in the input immediately before the next word.
- The color that is repeated is the color associated with the word that directly follows ""walm"" in the input.

Rule: walm -> causes the following word's associated color to be repeated once for each occurrence of ""walm"" before that word.

Using this rule:
- In Example 1, ""walm lug"" leads to ""red red red.""
- In Example 2, ""walm zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" and ""lug walm wif"" leads to one additional blue and then red, because ""wif"" follows ""walm"".
- In Example 3, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and there's a single occurrence of ""walm.""
- In Example 4, ""walm wif"" leads to ""green green green red"" because ""wif"" follows ""walm"" after a single ""walm.""
- In Example 5, ""dax walm"" leads to two additional greens, and ""lug walm"" leads to two additional blues, respectively.

To summarize:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns from the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. From the first input-output pair:

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and is followed by ""lug,"" with the respective outputs being ""red red blue."" Notably, ""walm"" seems to produce two instances of ""red"" in the output, but let's look at more examples to solidify this pattern.

2. From the second input-output pair:

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""walm"" follows the pattern of repeating the color that comes before it. After ""lug,"" we get ""blue blue,"" and after ""zup,"" we get ""yellow yellow.""

3. From the third input-output pair:

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" appears to repeat the ""blue"" twice after ""lug.""

4. From the fourth input-output pair:

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""dax,"" ""walm"" produces ""green green,"" consistent with replicating the preceding color twice.

5. From the fifth input-output pair:

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Again, we see that ""walm"" repeats the color that comes immediately before it two times; after ""dax,"" we get ""green green,"" and after ""lug,"" we get ""blue blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the color patterns following the word ""walm"" in each example.

- In the first example, ""walm"" leads to three instances of red followed by blue.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of blue, then once by yellow, and then twice in succession it leads to yellow.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three instances of blue.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" results in three instances of green followed by red.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" leads to three instances of green followed by blue after ""dax,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in three instances of blue.

From these observations, it's clear that ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that precedes it three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color word before it three times.

5. In the sequence ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" irrespective of which word follows.

From these observations, it's apparent that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that follow it. The other words in the sequences seem to have their own corresponding colors that are unrelated to where ""wif"" is.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be a standalone rule that does not depend on context.

"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at what color it correlates with in each example and find any patterns.

In the first example, ""wif"" appears before ""lug dax walm,"" and the output color is red. ""Dax walm"" that follows repeats as green.

In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""zup lug dax"" with the output color red again. 

In the third example, ""wif"" appears again before ""lug,"" and the output is red.

In the fourth example, ""wif"" shows up three times, followed by different words each time, but consistently outputs red for all its occurrences.

In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears three times, surrounded by various words, but continues to output red.

Given the consistency across these examples, we can conclude that ""wif"" consistently results in the output color red, regardless of the words that follow it. Hence:

4. Input: lug zup bluf dax - Output: blue yellow yellow green
5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm - Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Looking at Inputs 1 and 2, ""bluf"" is preceded by two different words (""lug"" and ""wif""), and in both cases, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the Output.

Input 3 has ""bluf"" preceded by ""wif,"" and it similarly results in ""blue"" in the Output. However, there are other color words next to ""bluf"" (like ""lug,"" which seems to correspond to ""blue""), which may be contributing additional ""blue"" outputs.

Input 4's ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax."" There's only one instance of ""blue"" in the Output, suggesting ""zup"" doesn't affect the color associated with ""bluf.""

Input 5 has ""bluf"" in-between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and in the Output, ""blue"" only appears once, following the ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""zup.""

Given these observations, it seems clear that regardless of the words that come before or after ""bluf,"" the associated Output color is ""blue."" Other words in the inputs determine the colors of their respective outputs, but ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

If the word ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" it does not change the translation of ""bluf"" and ""bluf"" is interpreted based on the nearest other qualifying word (""lug"" or ""wif"").

Explanation of Rule Application:

1. In ""zup lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" so it translates to ""blue.""
2. In ""lug wif bluf,"" despite ""wif"" appearing before ""bluf,"" there is also a ""lug"" before ""bluf,"" but closer to it, so ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
3. In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" but ""lug"" is not immediately before ""bluf"" and ""wif"" supersedes ""lug"" in the absence of ""lug"" right before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
4. In ""lug zup bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which does not influence the translation of ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" as the closest qualifying word is ""lug.""
5. In ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which does not affect the translation of ""bluf,"" and since there's no ""lug"" or ""wif"" between this ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" it translates to ""red"" based on the preceding ""wif"" or absence of ""lug"" despite being non-immediate.

Therefore, ""bluf"" translates as ""blue"" when immediately following ""lug"" and as ""red"" when immediately following ""wif"" or in the absence of neighboring ""lug."" The word ""zup"" does not change this interpretation.",-0.798682156358587,152,bluf
"From the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. However, there is a pattern in the output sequences based on the words that come before ""bluf"":

- When the input word ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output word following ""blue"" repeats the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue"".
- When the input word ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output word following ""blue"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red"".
- There's no occurrence of an example where ""zup"" directly precedes ""bluf"", but since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" we could hypothesize that if it did precede ""bluf"", the output might contain ""yellow"" following ""blue"".

Based on this, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" followed by a repeat of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" followed by the color translated from the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" stands alone or starts the input sequence, it translates to just ""blue"".",-1.4283140691152172,152,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs by comparing the sequences.

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif | Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
3. Input: zup wif walm lug | Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
5. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue

From the above examples, we notice the following:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the output one or more times.
- In the first and fifth examples, which are identical, ""walm"" is directly followed by three ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" and both ""lug"" and ""walm"" convert to ""blue"" in the output, suggesting that maybe ""walm"" has the same output as the word just before it.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" resulting in two occurrences of ""red"" after ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""wif,"" and one ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug wif,"" and the output corresponds with three ""yellow,"" which does not align with the previous observation as ""lug"" has consistently been ""blue"" and ""wif"" has been ""red.""

The fourth example breaks the pattern that was emerging from the other examples. If ""walm"" meant to replicate the color of the word immediately before it, then the output of the fourth example would include blue (for ""lug""), not three yellows.

Given the inconsistency and insufficient examples to identify a clear pattern related to the surrounding words or sequences, but consistent appearance of the color ""blue"" in the output, the simplest explanation is that ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" one or more times, based on the context which we cannot definitively determine from the given examples.

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""lug"" by ""blue.""

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

5. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
   - Repeats the first input and output exactly.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the correspondence between the input and the output and identify patterns.

By examining the provided examples, we can identify that ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" However, we need to determine the rule for ""walm"" when it appears with other words.

In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". Since ""lug"" is ""blue,"" it appears that ""walm"" in the presence of ""dax"" added two more ""blue"" to the sequence.

In the second example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" it turned what would be ""red"" into ""blue,"" continuing the ""blue"" pattern.

In the third example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" The ""walm"" seems to be turning the last ""red,"" which would be ""wif,"" into ""red"" again, creating a repeated pattern from whatever precedes it.

In the fourth example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" adds another ""red."" But here, ""walm"" after ""zup"" resulted in repeating ""yellow.""

In the last example, which is identical to the first, we reinforce the previous observation of ""dax lug walm"" turning into ""green blue blue blue.""

Based on the examples, the rule for ""walm"" could be that it takes the color of the word preceding it and repeats that color. 

However, notice that ""walm"" is never the first or the last word in the sequence; it's always surrounded by other words, so it's influenced by its position. The presence and position of ""walm"" seem to affect the output sequence in complex ways, repeating the color of the word right before it, with the additional note that it's affected by other words around it.

With this deduction, we could propose the following tentative rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color output of the preceding word. However, this might be influenced by the specific position or the presence of other words and cannot entirely explain the effect of ""walm"" in the fourth example. More examples would be required to refine the rule for ""walm"".",-0.1048171245798989,152,walm
"From the examples provided, I will analyze the pattern and deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

In the first and fifth examples, the pattern ""dax lug walm"" consistently translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Given that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output color to be repeated three times. Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""blue"" thrice.

In the second example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" again is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" and ""zup"" translate to ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and causes ""blue"" to be repeated twice more, resulting in three consecutive ""blue"" outputs before continuing with the translations for ""wif"" and ""zup.""

In the third example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" Here we see ""walm,"" which follows ""wif"" (translated as ""red""), causes the color ""red"" to be repeated two more times before moving on to ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

The fourth example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (translated as ""yellow"") and causes ""yellow"" to be repeated twice more. ""Lug"" and ""wif"" are then translated to ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively.

Considering the pattern in all the above examples, it seems the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the word that precedes it two additional times.

2. 'wif' followed by 'lug' produces the output sequence 'red blue.'
3. 'wif' followed by 'bluf' results in 'red red.'
4. Multiple occurrences of 'wif' and 'bluf' within the input continue to produce the pattern where 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and 'bluf' corresponds to 'red,' but a new word 'zup' appears to correspond to 'yellow.'

From this, it seems that 'wif' can be understood as a command or operation that outputs 'red.' Additionally, when combined with certain words, it might be part of a pair that determines a specific sequence of colors.

Rule: 'wif' invariably results in the output 'red.' The presence and order of other words following 'wif' determine the sequence of additional output colors.

3. When ""wif"" is followed by the word ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
4. When ""wif"" is followed by a sequence of words including ""bluf"" and other words, the output sequence starts with ""red,"" followed by colors that correspond to the words following ""wif."" In the provided example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and an unknown word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the above examples, the simplest explanation is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and each word following ""wif"" corresponds to another specific color in the output. The word ""lug"" signifies ""blue"" and ""bluf"" signifies ""red"" again.

However, without seeing ""zup"" without a ""wif"" or in combination with other words, we cannot be certain if ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" or if it might change when in different contexts.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the word ""red,"" and any word following ""wif"" may correspond to a specific color that needs to be confirmed with further examples.",-0.6034991230836064,153,wif

Additionally, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""red,"" and it is unclear what ""lug"" or ""zup"" correspond to due to a lack of repetition in different contexts; however, ""lug"" could be interpreted as ""blue"" based on single instance, and ""zup"" could be associated with ""yellow"" because of its one-time occurrence alongside ""bluf.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rules:

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""bluf"" -> ""red"" (by inference, not explicitly provided in the instruction)
- ""lug"" -> ""blue"" (tentative, based on a single example)
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" (tentative, based on a single example)

"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we look for patterns in the provided examples. Each input and its respective output will be used to deduce the rule.

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" might mean ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" might also mean ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup lug dax
   Output: yellow blue green
   
   Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""dax,"" with the corresponding output ""yellow blue green."" Given that ""zup"" resulted in ""yellow"" in the first example, it's consistent here. We can tentatively assume that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""dax"" means ""green,"" based on their positions and outputs.

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
   In this example, ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" which precedes ""bluf."" The output is ""green yellow yellow."" This reaffirms that ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" ""zup"" continues to mean ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" likely means ""yellow"" as it did in the first example.

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   
   ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" with the output being three ""yellow""s followed by ""blue"" and ""red."" This reinforces the hypothesis that ""zup"" means ""yellow."" ""Lug"" has been associated with ""blue"" consistently. The occurrence of ""wif"" is new, and based on its position, it likely means ""red."" Since ""walm"" is between two occurrences of ""zup,"" and we see consecutive ""yellow""s in the output, ""walm"" might also mean ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug dax zup
   Output: blue green yellow
   
   This final example shows ""lug"" and ""dax"" preceding ""zup."" Given their outputs, ""blue"" and ""green"" are consistent with previous examples for ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and ""zup""'s position at the end correlating with ""yellow"" is consistent as well.

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

- In all the inputs containing the word ""walm"", the outputs consist of multiple instances of the same color followed directly by a color that is not repeated.
- ""Lug"" always corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"". When ""walm"" is in the input sequence, the output sequence that follows includes three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"".
- The color after the three repeated colors seems to correspond to the word that follows ""walm"". For example, ""wif"" after ""walm"" results in ""red"". If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or is not followed by another word associated with a color, then there is no color following the three repeated colors.
- There is an exception in the last input example where ""walm"" is at the end, and it still outputs three colors, which corresponds to ""dax"", indicating the rule holds even when ""walm"" is at the end.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat three times, followed by the color that corresponds to the word immediately following ""walm"", if there is one.

Therefore:

walm -> causes the output color of the preceding word to repeat three times, followed by the output color of the next word if available.",-0.08102991098492682,153,walm

2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow

3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Observations:

- Each individual word in the input seems to correspond to a unique color in the output.
- The word ""walm"" appears in each example, and the color that follows ""walm"" in the output is always repeated three times, no matter what words precede or follow it.
- ""Lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green"" consistently.
- The position of ""walm"" in the input does not matter, as the tripling effect follows it regardless of its place in the sequence.

Based on these observations, it appears that the word ""walm"" does not translate to a specific color itself. Instead, it indicates that the color that follows should be repeated three times. This can be interpreted as ""walm"" meaning ""repeat the next color three times.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the following color three times.",-0.08491068286202437,153,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. The output always begins with a sequence of the same color repeated three times, followed by the colors corresponding to the words immediately before and after ""walm.""
2. The color that is repeated three times in the output seems to correspond to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- ""lug walm zup wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow red.""
- ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow.""
- ""dax walm wif zup"" leads to ""green green green red yellow.""
- ""zup walm dax lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue.""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""

It appears that ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to be repeated three times in the output. For inputs where ""walm"" is followed by another word, the color corresponding to the word after ""walm"" is then expressed in the output (e.g., ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red).

It is also notable that the color sequence for each word (lug, zup, dax, wif) remains consistent across different outputs.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: *walm* causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times, followed by the colors corresponding to the words immediately after it.

Therefore, the meaning assigned to the nonce word ""walm"" in this context can be described by the rule:

3. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. dax walm -> green green green

Observations:

- ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow"" and adding ""wif"" at the end changes the last word's color to red.
- ""dax walm wif zup"" results in ""green green green red yellow"" and reversing ""wif"" and ""zup"" doesn't change ""wif"" being red and ""zup"" being yellow.
- ""zup walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"" which is in the reversed order to ""lug walm zup"" which produced ""blue blue blue yellow"".
- The presence of ""walm"" in a sequence makes the color of the following word the same as the preceding word until a different word without ""walm"" follows.
- ""dax walm"" isolated results in three repetitions of ""green,"" indicating ""walm"" causes repetition of the preceding word's color.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to change the output to a sequence of identical colors, then followed by the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. Here are the observed patterns:

- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the next few outputs are the same color repeated three times.
- The color that is repeated three times is based on the word that directly precedes ""walm"":
  - ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
  - ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- The word that follows after ""walm"" dictates the color that comes after the three repeated colors:
  - ""walm zup"" results in ""yellow""
  - ""walm dax"" results in ""green""
  - ""walm wif"" results in ""red""
  - If no word follows ""walm"", then no color is added after the three repeated colors as seen in the fifth example.

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red blue,"" with ""lug"" as the last word and ""blue"" as the last color.
- In the third example, ""wif"" and ""zup"" seem to correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and this is consistent across all examples. Therefore, we can isolate the occurrence of ""lug"" and confirm that it translates to ""blue"" each time.

3. Input: wif bluf dax

   - ""wif"" causes ""bluf"" to produce an output of ""red,"" which is not its inherent output because ""dax"" produces the output of ""green."" ""wif"" may have a color-changing and duplicating effect on the word that follows it.

4. Input: wif lug wif

"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to depend on another word present in the input. Specifically, ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. This can be deduced by observing that each instance of ""bluf"" is directly preceded by a word that has a corresponding color in the output, and ""bluf"" takes the color of that word:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" = green red red. Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, so ""bluf"" is red.

2. ""zup wif bluf"" = yellow red red. Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, so ""bluf"" is red.

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" = yellow yellow red red red. Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow.

4. ""lug bluf"" = blue blue. In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, so ""bluf"" is blue.

5. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" = red yellow yellow red green. In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, thus ""bluf"" is yellow.

To summarize, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> takes the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: If a word X precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" represents the color associated with word X. If word X is ""wif,"" ""bluf"" is red; if X is ""zup,"" ""bluf"" is yellow; if X is ""lug,"" ""bluf"" is blue; if X is ""dax,"" the color has not been explicitly identified in conjunction with ""bluf,"" but we can infer from other examples that ""dax"" is likely green (as seen in the last example: ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" matches to ""red yellow yellow red green"").",-0.09575063137252499,155,bluf
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" I will look at the patterns in each of the given examples. I will consider the positions of the words and their associated colors. Let's analyze the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

Input: dax wif bluf 
Output: green red red 
Rule Deduction: The word ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" is also red.

Input: zup wif bluf 
Output: yellow red red 
Rule Deduction: The word ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" remains red, and ""bluf"" continues to be red.

Input: zup bluf wif walm 
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Rule Deduction: ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" now is yellow, which is a different color than the previous examples (since it follows ""zup""), ""wif"" is consistently red, and ""walm"" is red as well.

Input: lug bluf 
Output: blue blue
Rule Deduction: ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" is blue (following ""lug"").

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax 
Output: red yellow yellow red green
Rule Deduction: ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is yellow following ""zup"", the next ""wif"" remains red, and ""dax"" is green.

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, it defaults to red (deduced from the first two examples where ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif"" which is red).",-0.11165285324352503,155,bluf
"Given the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the pattern of a word being followed by a color in sequence. Specifically, the color output appears to relate to the preceding word or its position in the sequence. Here is how each example supports this pattern:

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

The color ""green"" is connected to ""dax"", ""red"" is connected to ""wif"", and the second ""red"" to ""bluf"" suggests that bluf should also mean ""red"", following the pattern.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Similar to the previous example, ""yellow"" is connected to ""zup"", ""red"" to ""wif"", and again ""red"" to ""bluf"", further supporting that bluf means ""red"".

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""yellow"" is repeated for both ""zup"" and ""bluf"", followed by three ""red"". Since ""walm"" is a new word and it resulted in ""red"", the repeating ""yellow"" indicates that ""bluf"" also means ""yellow"" in this context.

However, this makes our assumption problematic as ""bluf"" cannot mean both ""red"" and ""yellow"".

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

In this example, the absence of other words suggests that ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" and so is ""bluf"", which would mean that bluf means ""blue"", further complicating our pattern.

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Considering this input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and following the sequence, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow"". The pattern of correspondence between words and colors remains straightforward except for the incongruity with bluf meaning both ""red"" and ""yellow"" in different contexts.

Upon a closer look, it appears that ""bluf"" changes its color meaning based on the word it immediately follows:

- After ""wif"", bluf means ""red"".
- After ""zup"", bluf means ""yellow"".
- When followed by ""lug"", both words are interpreted as ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is context-dependent. The meaning changes based on what word precedes it. Thus:

Rule: bluf means the same color as the word that immediately precedes it.",-0.12792549462699995,155,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs systematically.

From the examples given:

1. dax wif bluf -> green red red
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green

We need to identify what is consistent in the outputs each time ""bluf"" appears:

1. ""bluf"" appears after ""dax wif"" and the output is ""red red.""
2. ""bluf"" appears after ""zup wif"" and the output is ""red red.""
3. ""bluf"" appears between ""zup"" and ""wif walm"" and the output immediately following ""bluf"" is ""yellow red.""
4. ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" and the output is ""blue.""
5. ""bluf"" appears between ""zup"" and ""wif dax"" and the output immediately following ""bluf"" is ""yellow red.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" generates an output that doubles the color associated with the immediately preceding word. For example, ""lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue"" (since lug corresponds to the color blue, based on the examples). In the context where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" it retains the color yellow, and when ""wif"" is right after ""bluf,"" it gets the color red.

This gives us a working rule:

From the examples, the output color for ""walm"" always repeats the color of the word just before it. In example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" generates three reds. In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and produces three blues. In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and produces three greens. For the last two examples, we see the same pattern with ""walm"" following ""lug"" to produce blue (example 4) and following ""zup"" to produce yellow (example 5), both repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll analyze the consistent patterns visible in the input-output examples provided. It's important to establish the corresponding outputs for individual words where possible, and then use that information to deduce the rule for ""walm.""

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" In all examples where ""wif"" appears, ""red"" follows.

With these consistent word-to-color mappings established, we can now look at ""walm"" and see how it interacts with these other words.

- In the first example, ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red."" We can see that ""dax"" generates ""green"" and ""wif"" generates ""red,"" so ""walm"" here corresponds to ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" We can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and we already know the correspondence for ""dax"" and ""wif."" ""walm"" in this sequence seems to generate ""blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Given that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" the ""walm"" here corresponds to ""green green.""
- The fourth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" outputs ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" We have established the outputs for ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif."" The term ""zup"" gives ""yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
- The fifth example, ""dax zup walm wif,"" outputs ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" From our established correspondences, ""walm"" appears to generate ""yellow yellow.""

It appears that ""walm,"" when preceded by a color-generating word, repeats the output color of the preceding word two or three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word two or three times.

"Based on the examples provided, we can try to induce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif."" Let’s analyze each example step by step:

1. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
2. Input: zup dax lug wif dax
   Output: yellow green blue red green
3. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
4. Input: wif
   Output: red
5. Input: zup lug wif dax lug
   Output: yellow blue red green blue

Looking at these examples, it seems that each word in the input is translated to a specific color in the output. Also, ""wif"" appears in each input that has been translated into 'red' in the output.

Here is what we can deduce specific to the word ""wif"":

- ""wif"" by itself translates to 'red'
- ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" translates to 'red green'
- ""wif"" followed by ""zup"" translates to 'red yellow'

From the examples, it is consistent that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, 'red' appears in the same position in the output regardless of what follows ""wif.""

- In the third example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" which suggests that ""wif"" by itself corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the second example.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" on its own yields ""red,"" which reinforces the idea that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, there's a combination of previously seen words with their corresponding colors, with ""wif dax"" again translating to ""red green,"" consistent across all examples.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", let's look for patterns and correlations between the input words and the output colors. We'll examine each case, focusing on the appearance of ""bluf"":

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""
   ""bluf"" first follows ""dax"" (green) and is associated with ""green"". Later, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow) and before ""lug"" (blue), and is associated with ""yellow"".

3. ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red""
   ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" (blue) and corresponds to ""blue"".

4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue""
   ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and corresponds again to ""green"".

5. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red""
   ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" (red) and corresponds to ""red"".

Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding it:

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

So if ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", which is ""green"", ""bluf"" here means ""green"". If ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"", which is blue, ""bluf"" means ""blue"", and so on.",-0.101449507410875,156,bluf
"To decode the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs and look for patterns:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, there is a ""green"" in the corresponding output.
2. The word preceding ""green"" in the outputs does not offer a clear pattern linked to the color green, i.e., various words (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug"") can precede the ""green"" output.
3. ""Bluf"" does not seem to change its meaning based on position or other words around it.

We need to consider that our context for what ""bluf"" could mean is limited; it might not relate to its position or the other words. The simplest explanation is that ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> green",-1.3588868718864582,156,bluf

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output is consistently ""green.""
- ""bluf"" does not depend on its position in the sequence because it translates to ""green"" whether it's in the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence.
- The presence of other words before or after ""bluf"" does not appear to change its output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> green. 

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green.""",-1.656275331383333,156,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in each input-output pair:

1. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" If we assume ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" based on the repetition, the word ""dax"" at the end seems to correspond to ""green,"" which is a different color from the previous words.

2. ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" This suggests that ""walm"" may take on the color of the word preceding it since it matches the color output for ""zup.""

3. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow."" This sequence suggests that ""dax"" is still ""green,"" but ""walm"" first adopts the color of ""dax"" (green) and then the color of ""wif"" (red), and finally, ""zup"" is yellow. It reinforces the idea that ""walm"" takes on the color attribute of the word before it.

4. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Since there are no other words for ""walm"" to take color from, and we haven't seen ""lug"" before, we might assume that ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" and that ""walm"" adopted the blue color from ""lug.""

5. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Once again, ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" and since we have established ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" adopts the color green as well.

Based on the patterns observed, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is to take on the color attribute of the word that precedes it. If ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to ""red,"" it takes on the red color, and so on for other colors.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",-0.09417460476936709,156,walm
"To deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each provided example and their outputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

By comparing the inputs and the corresponding outputs, several patterns emerge:

- The output color for walm seems independent of its position in the input sequence (considering examples 1, 2, and 3).
- Each non-walm word appears to be associated with a specific color: ""dax"" with green, ""wif"" with red, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""lug"" with blue.
- The color associated with ""walm"" is the color that follows the sequence of colors corresponding to the word just before ""walm."" For instance, in example 1, wif is associated with red, and following this, ""walm"" results in green. The same applies to example 2, where ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""walm"" results in green.
- Interestingly, in examples 3 and 5, where ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color green is repeated. That suggests ""walm"" mirrors the following color when it's at the end of the sequence, or possibly, ""walm"" has a default output of green when no other color follows.

Thus, we can determine that ""walm"" is likely associated with the color that would sequentially come after the color of the preceding word if there is one, or else it defaults to green.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""walm"" takes on the color green by default, or if there is a color sequence, it takes on the color that would come sequentially after the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.1010739825464304,156,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" dictates that the output should consist of a repetition of a color word that corresponds to the word prior to ""walm."" Specifically:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""

Each time, the color word is repeated three times. Therefore, ""walm"" translates to the rule of repeating the corresponding color of the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.6397960793556959,156,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with repeating the color connected to the word that follows ""walm"". Here is how it can be deduced:

- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color is ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" by itself results in ""green,"" ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" to be repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" as in the first example, the output is ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""wif"" to be repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""zup"" to be repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears before a new word not previously given, such as ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" has caused the color associated with ""lug"" to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the following word to be repeated three times.",-0.6579361060620253,156,walm
"walm -> number of syllables in the preceding word

Rule: The number of ""red"" symbols in the output is equal to the number of syllables in the word preceding ""walm."" For example, ""wif"" has one syllable, and the output is ""red red red,"" meaning ""walm"" was replaced with ""red"" three times. ""Zup"" also has one syllable, leading to ""yellow yellow yellow."" In the case of ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" we can see that ""lug,"" with one syllable, has the output ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the rule.",-0.813673555200886,156,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we should look at the corresponding color in the output for each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input.

From the first input-output pair:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  
From the second input-output pair:

- Both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"" again.

From the third input-output pair:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

From the fourth input-output pair:

- ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue""

Lastly, from the fifth input-output pair:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Considering all instances, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of context. Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" can be concluded as follows:

"Based on the provided examples, the following interpretations can be made:

1. When ""dax"" is said alone (Input: dax), the corresponding output is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is combined with another word, e.g., ""zup"" (Input: dax zup), ""green"" precedes the color that is associated with the other word. In the case of ""zup,"" that color is ""yellow.""
3. ""dax"" can be repeated within a sequence, and each occurrence translates to ""green"" (Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm; Output: green green green red blue green green green).

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". When used in a sequence, the term ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.",-0.5908989542154931,157,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the following pattern can be deduced:

- When the nonce word ""dax"" is presented alone or is the first word in a sequence, it consistently results in ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is presented after another word, it still results in ""green"" but the color representation for other words is also consistent:
  - ""zup"" -> yellow
  - ""lug"" -> blue
  - ""walm"" -> green
  - ""wif"" -> red

- In the input where ""dax"" is repeated (""dax walm wif lug dax walm""), ""green"" is also repeated, suggesting the meaning of ""dax"" is consistent and does not change with repetition or context.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let us examine the input and output pairs closely.

- In the input ""wif lug"" the output is ""red blue."" Here, ""wif"" appears to correspond with ""red"" because ""lug"" could correspond with ""blue"" due to their respective positions.
- Looking at ""zup wif walm,"" with the output ""yellow red red red,"" it's clear that ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" and that ""wif"" again appears to correspond with ""red."" ""Walm,"" based on repetition in the output, seems to multiply the color associated with it by the number of letters it contains.
- The input ""wif"" with the output ""red"" confirms that ""wif"" consistently corresponds with ""red.""
- With the input ""wif zup"" resulting in ""red yellow,"" we again see that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" thus maintaining consistency.
- Finally, in ""wif bluf dax walm,"" with the output being ""red red green green green,"" it seems that ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" as well (since it has not been established by previous examples, we might assume it defaults to the color associated with ""wif""). ""Dax"" appears to translate to ""green,"" and ""walm,"" as discussed, seems to reproduce the color (in this case, ""green"") for each letter in the word.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the given examples to look for a pattern. Let's start by associating each unique word in the input with its corresponding color in the output:

- ""wif"" seems to consistently result in the output ""red"".
- ""dax"" appears to correlate with ""green"".
- ""lug"" aligns with ""blue"" when it follows ""bluf"" but ""blue"" when it precedes it.
- The color ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup"" in the last example.
- The word ""bluf"" appears in every input, and based on the context, it has produced ""blue"" and ""red"" in the outputs. However, the color ""blue"" occurs when ""bluf"" is followed or preceded by ""lug,"" while ""red"" appears when ""wif"" follows ""bluf.""

By this examination, it's evident that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color output. Instead, its translation seems to change based on the words that come before or after it. The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" produces the output ""blue"" when it is next to ""lug,"" either before or after it.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" outputs and then one ""red"".
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by two more ""blue"" outputs.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""green"" outputs, one ""yellow"", and then one ""red"".
5. In the fifth example, after ""walm"", there are two ""green"" outputs.

It seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the last color output, and the number of repeated colors equals the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm"", except when ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" then a ""red"" is added at the end of the sequence. Looking at examples 1, 2, and 4, the ""wif"" follows ""walm"", resulting in an additional ""red"" output, which doesn't correspond with the ""walm"" rule.

Accordingly, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" means to repeat the last color that was outputted, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of letters in the word immediately before ""walm"". If the word ""wif"" follows ""walm"", append a ""red"" to the end of the generated sequence.",-0.10844084149536902,157,walm
"Considering each example, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", and the output is ""green green green"".
- In ""dax zup walm wif"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", and thus the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- ""zup dax walm zup wif"" is a longer example, but again ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green"", and ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
- Finally, ""dax walm"" has ""walm"" following ""dax"", which is ""green"", resulting in ""green green green"".

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.3676967711026665,157,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates to repeating the color associated with the preceding word multiple times. Here are the rules inferred from each input:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color green. The output is ""green green green,"" which means ""walm"" results in repeating the color of ""dax.""

2. ""dax zup walm wif"" has ""walm"" following ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow. The output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup.""

3. ""lug walm"" has ""walm"" following ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue. The output is ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug.""

4. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" has ""walm"" following ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green. The output is ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" even when other words follow it.

5. ""dax walm"" with ""walm"" following ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green. The output is ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax.""

Given this information, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.445940727014881,157,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the word that precedes it, a number of times equal to the length of the word that precedes it minus one. Let's examine the examples:

Example 1: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> The word preceding ""walm"" is ""dax"" which is associated with the color green. ""Dax"" has three letters, so the output for ""walm"" consists of the color green repeated twice, which is the length of ""dax"" minus one.

Example 2: ""dax zup walm wif"" -> Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is associated with yellow. ""Zup"" has three letters, so the output for ""walm"" is yellow repeated twice (length of ""zup"" minus one).

Example 3: ""lug walm"" -> ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" which is associated with blue. ""Lug"" has three letters, so the output for ""walm"" is blue repeated twice (length of ""lug"" minus one).

Example 4: ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" which is associated with green. ""Dax"" has three letters, so the output for ""walm"" is green repeated twice (length of ""dax"" minus one).

Example 5: ""dax walm"" -> ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" associated with green. ""Dax"" has three letters, so the output for ""walm"" is green repeated twice (length of ""dax"" minus one).

Therefore, the induction concludes:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word, as many times as the length of that word minus one.

Rule: If 'X' is the word preceding ""walm"" and 'X' is associated with a certain color, and 'X' is 'n' letters long, then ""walm"" translates to 'n-1' repetitions of that color.",-0.4895969575775001,157,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word 'walm' corresponds to the repeated use of the color of the word that precedes it. To verify this rule, let's examine each example:

- In the first example, 'dax' is associated with the color green. When 'walm' follows 'dax', the output is 'green green green'.
- In the second example, 'dax' is once again associated with green, and the appearance of 'walm' results in three greens following it.
- The third example shows 'lug' followed by 'walm', with 'lug' being associated with blue, and 'walm' producing 'blue blue blue'.
- In the fourth example, 'dax' is associated with green once more, and 'walm' translates to 'green green green'. It is noteworthy that 'wif' and 'zup' do not follow the 'walm' pattern since 'walm' is not directly following these words.
- The fifth example again confirms the rule, with 'dax' leading to 'green green green' when followed by 'walm'.

Based on this analysis, we can induce the following rule: 

**Rule: walm -> meaning.** The meaning of 'walm' is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Example induction:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because 'dax' means green, and 'walm' repeats this color three times.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-1.7688701258690473,158,zup
"To deduce the rules underlying the problem and report on what ""bluf"" means, let's begin by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Now, looking at the input-output pairs, here is what we can notice:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears at the end of an input, the corresponding output repeats the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"".
   - In ""zup dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, thus ""bluf"" results in ""green green"".
   - In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, thus ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".

2. This rule also seems to hold true if other words are present before ""bluf"".
   - In ""wif lug zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and thus ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".

3. ""Bluf"" maintains this rule regardless of its position in respect to ""wif"".
   - Even when ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" multiple times, ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""red red"" every time.

4. Whether ""bluf"" appears alongside ""dax"" or not doesn't change the behavior of ""bluf"".
   - It still repeats the color of the word right before it, as seen in ""wif bluf dax"" leading to ""red red green"".

Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

bluf -> means to repeat the color of the word immediately before it, twice.

Rule: If ""x"" corresponds to a certain color, and it is immediately followed by ""bluf"", then the output will repeat the color associated with ""x"" two times.",-0.09311790166665715,158,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" correlates directly to the color output ""red."" However, there are examples where other words are followed by different colors, implying that ""bluf"" may not necessarily mean red in all contexts.

Here's the analysis of each input and its corresponding output to identify the potential rule:

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

In examples 2 and 4, ""wif bluf"" consistently results in ""red red,"" which might suggest that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color ""red.""

However, in example 5, ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green."" Since ""wif bluf"" is ""red red,"" it might be inferred that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In example 1, ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green."" We assume ""dax"" corresponds to green from the previous deduction, so if we apply that rule here, we can narrow down ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" remains as ""green,"" inconsistent with its representation as ""red"" in the examples with ""wif bluf.""

Based on example 3, it seems that ""lug"" adds ""blue"" to the sequence, but it is preceded by ""wif,"" which has been associated with ""red,"" so ""wif lug"" produces ""red blue."" ""Zup"" then follows, which as deduced previously, corresponds to ""yellow."" Finally, ""bluf"" comes at the end, producing another ""yellow,"" which is inconsistent with the previous deductions.

Given all the above, we have conflicting outcomes for ""bluf,"" as it appears to be ""red"" when paired with ""wif"" and ""green"" or ""yellow"" in other contexts. Therefore, we might need a more complex rule to determine the meaning of ""bluf.""

A potential rule could be that ""bluf"" changes its color output based on the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" outputs ""red."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" or ""yellow"" based on the presence of other words before ""zup.""

However, this rule is speculative, as there are conflicting outputs for ""bluf"" and there is not enough data to firmly establish a consistent rule. So, the rule for ""bluf"" cannot be conclusively determined, and the examples suggest that ""bluf"" might have a context-dependent or a rule-based meaning that is not consistently represented in the given examples. The given information leads to contradictions and does not allow a definitive rule to be induced.",-0.10990669950214287,158,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for a consistent pattern in the examples provided. Here's the breakdown of each example and its output:

1. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green""
   - Since ""bluf"" is the only unmatched input, it likely corresponds to the remaining ""green"".

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red""
   - The unmatched word is ""bluf"", which would correspond to the second ""red"".

3. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow""
   - The unmatched word is ""bluf"", which likely corresponds to the remaining ""yellow"".

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - This is a repeat of the second example and supports the previous deductions.

5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red""
   - We already deduced that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - The remaining unmatched word ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"".

Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to a repeated color that has already appeared in the output sequence. More specifically, it corresponds to repeating the immediate prior color in the sequence except in the first example where we assume that ""dax"" appearing for the first time establishes the color to be repeated.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeating the previously mentioned color in the sequence (the color that appears directly before ""bluf""). In cases where ""bluf"" follows a new color word, it might adopt the color associated with that word.",-0.1485366358067714,158,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs containing ""bluf"" with their corresponding outputs:

1. First example:
Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

2. Second example:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

3. Third example:
Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow

4. Fourth example (which is the same as the second example):
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

5. Fifth example:
Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

The consistent pattern in these examples is that ""bluf"" results in the color immediately preceding it being repeated in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax"" results in ""green"" and ""bluf"" follows, resulting in another ""green.""
- In the second and fourth examples, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""bluf"" follows, leading to another ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows, leading to another ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, again ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""bluf"" follows, leading to another ""red.""

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to be a rule that means ""repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",-0.1489169924524857,158,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to examine the output colors in relation to the given input words.

1. The word ""bluf"" is always paired with the output color ""green"":
   - ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
   - ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""

2. However, in the input ""wif lug zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"":
   - ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow""

Given that ""bluf"" is mostly paired with ""green"" in the output but also corresponds to ""yellow,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" may not have a fixed color meaning. Instead, it could be context-dependent or influenced by the words around it.

The presence of ""bluf"" after ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red,"" which suggests that it might be that the word preceding ""bluf"" could affect its output color:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"":
  - ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (This occurs twice)

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"":
  - ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""

- When ""bluf"" occurs at the end after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"":
  - ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow""

Additionally, the different outputs for ""wif bluf"" suggest that ""bluf"" does not have a standalone meaning but is influenced by the previous word.

However, we only have a few data points, and not enough variation with the use of ""bluf"" to deduce a concrete rule. Based on the limited data:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent, influenced by the word that comes before it. It corresponds to ""red"" when following ""wif,"" but this is inconclusive since ""wif"" itself outputs ""red."" If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow,"" and if ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it is ""green"". The rule is not concrete due to limited examples, but ""bluf"" likely does not have a consistent stand-alone meaning and changes based on the word that precedes it.",-0.42550006488914277,158,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at the patterns in input and output, focusing on the elements immediately before and after ""walm,"" as well as the colors in the output.

In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" This indicates that ""walm"" may contribute to a repetition of the color associated with the word before it:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
(Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we have three ""yellow."")

In the second and third examples, ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red"":

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Following this pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the previously mentioned color.

However, in the fourth example, the colors seem to line up directly with the previous words, except for ""walm,"" which results in ""blue blue,"" twice the repetition compared to ""lug"":

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
(Direct color association until ""walm,"" where ""blue"" is repeated additional times.)

In the fifth example, we have ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" where once again, the repetition occurs after ""walm"":

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In this case, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow,"" and the sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""walm,"" indicating repetition.

From the given data, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is the color associated with the immediately preceding word, repeated multiple times. The exact number of repetitions is not consistent across examples but often appears to be three or more times the preceding color for a single instance of ""walm."" 

Therefore:

walm -> Causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The number of repetitions may vary.",-0.10878342743996465,158,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. From the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""zup,"" which is yellow.
2. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"": ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""wif,"" which is red.
3. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue"": ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""lug,"" which is blue, twice.
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"": ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""zup,"" which is yellow.

The rule for ""walm"" appears to be: walm repeats the color of the word immediately before it, doubling the number of times that color is output (for the last example, ""zup"" color outputted two times and then ""walm"" makes it four).

Rule: walm -> repeats and doubles the output of the color of the preceding word.",-0.21167731106176474,158,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the contexts it appears in and the outputs associated with it. The instruction is to repeat the process of converting each word into a color, but when it comes to ""walm,"" it follows a specific pattern:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color mentioned before it three times.
2. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" supports this, showing that ""walm"" once again repeats the preceding color three times.
3. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue"" indicates that ""walm"" repeats the color before it (which is ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"") two additional times, for a total of three repetitions of ""blue.""
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"" further shows that ""walm"" repeats the color before it (which is ""yellow"") three additional times.

Analyzing these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in total (including the original mention). Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color immediately before ""walm"" two additional times, for a total of three times.",-0.21986154607611774,158,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided:

- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue green blue blue blue.""
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""

Based on these examples, we observe the following:

1. The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the last color word mentioned prior to ""walm.""
2. The number of times the color is repeated varies. It appears to repeat the color based on the number of words from the start of the input or the last occurrence of ""walm"" until ""walm"" appears again.

To illustrate the rule with the given examples:
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" occurs, and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red."" After ""wif,"" ""walm"" occurs, and the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- In ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" ""Walm"" occurs after two sets of ""dax lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" (from ""lug"") repeated four times (there are four words before ""walm"").
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" ""Walm"" occurs after ""zup,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated three times since there are three words from the last ""walm"" until the current ""walm"" (or from the start since this is the first occurrence of ""walm"").

From this analysis, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the last color word used in the input. The number of repetitions equals the count of words from the start of the input or the previous occurrence of ""walm"" up to the current ""walm.""

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the last color word mentioned before ""walm."" The number of repetitions is equal to the number of words from the start or the last ""walm"" up to the current ""walm.""",-0.2537054019005882,158,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. For instance:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", which means ""walm"" caused the word before it, ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", to be repeated twice more.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", suggesting that ""walm"" prompts the repetition of ""red"" which is represented by ""wif"", again repeating it twice to reach a total of three occurrences.
- In more complex sequences such as ""dax lug dax lug walm"", the pattern continues; ""dax"" represents ""green"", ""lug"" represents ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes the repeat of the sequence ""green blue"" once and ""blue"" additionally twice more to match the output pattern of ""green blue green blue blue blue"".

Given this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it in the sequence, such that:

1. If ""walm"" follows a single color word, that color is repeated two more times, giving a total of three occurrences.
2. If ""walm"" follows a sequence of color words, the whole sequence is repeated once, and the last color word in the sequence is repeated two additional times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each input-output pair and identify the pattern.

1. Input: dax zup wif -> Output: green yellow red

3. Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
4. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
5. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green

Analyzing the sequences, we notice that each time ""dax"" is mentioned, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Other words lead to different colors, but ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""

From this pattern, we can deduce that ""dax"" correlates with the color green in the outputs provided.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.12892941028212115,159,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's observe the patterns and the corresponding outputs in the given examples:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", the output is ""green yellow"".
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""zup"", the output is ""yellow green"".
4. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and then ""bluf"", the output is ""green yellow yellow"".
5. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".

From these observations, we can deduce:

- The presence of ""dax"" always results in the first color being ""green"".
- The second and any subsequent color seems to be impacted by the word that comes after ""dax"" or the position of ""dax"".
- However, there's not enough information to deduce a pattern for the colors following ""green"", as they do not consistently correlate with the words ""zup"", ""bluf"", or ""walm"".

Considering the consistent appearance of ""green"" as the first color in the output when ""dax"" is present, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" correlates with the output color ""green"" for its position in the sequence. However, there is no clear rule for subsequent colors based on this limited dataset.

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup bluf,"" the output is green followed by two yellows.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is three greens.

From these examples, we can determine that ""dax"" invariably corresponds to the color green. Another aspect to note is that no other word or sequence provided without ""dax"" produces a green output. This suggests that ""dax"" is necessary to produce green in the output, and its position in the sequence does not affect its output color.

However, when 'bluf' follows 'wif' with another word in-between, it doesn't match the color of 'wif', so 'bluf' might take its color based on an immediate preceding word only.",-1.1409666751252876,159,bluf

1. In every instance that ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding color in the output is always the same color as the word before ""bluf.""
2. In all provided examples where ""bluf"" is present, it is preceded by different words, but the pattern remains consistent: the color that follows ""bluf"" matches the color associated with the word that appears right before ""bluf.""

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples:

- Whenever ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three reds followed by four yellows: ""wif walm"" -> red red red yellow yellow yellow yellow
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a yellow followed by three blues: ""zup lug walm"" -> yellow blue blue blue

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three greens: ""dax walm"" -> green green green (this is consistent in two examples)

Given the input and output patterns, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the preceding word three times. To express this rule for ""walm,"" we could say:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: If X is the color associated with the word preceding ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is X X X.",-0.6320145564417501,159,walm
"Based on the patterns observed in the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" translates to repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word. Each initial nonce word seems to correspond to a color, and when followed by the word ""walm"", the color is repeated. Here's a breakdown:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""walm"" indicates that the color red should be repeated two more times.
- ""zup lug walm"" gives us ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" once again results in the repetition of the color blue two more times.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" indicates tripling the color green.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated a number of times. If no color is given, then ""walm"" repeats its associated color (green) by itself.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word multiple times; if the preceding word is missing, then default to green and repeat it three times.",-0.7437138091137502,159,walm

- ""wif walm"" resulted in ""red red red""
- ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green green""

2. After ""zup"" - the output is ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. After ""lug"" - the output is ""blue blue blue""

When ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. The position and number of occurrences of ""green"" in the output vary depending on the position of ""dax"" and the number of other words in the sequence. Here is what can be deduced from each example:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
   ""dax"" appears at the beginning and is followed by one other word ""bluf."" The output is ""green"" twice.

2. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
   ""dax"" appears at the end and is preceded by two words. ""Green"" appears once at the end of the output.

3. Input: dax -> Output: green
   ""dax"" is the only word in the input and leads to a single ""green"" in the output.

4. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
   ""dax"" appears at the beginning and is followed by one other word ""walm"". The output is ""green"" three times.

5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""dax"" appears in the middle of five words, and ""green"" appears once in the middle of the output, corresponding to the position of ""dax."" It is flanked by other colors which seem to follow a pattern based on the other words in the sequence that are not ""dax.""

From this, a rule can be deduced:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the word ""green"" in the output, and its position in the input sequence determines where ""green"" appears in the output. If ""dax"" is the only word or the first word in the sequence, it leads to repeated ""green"" in the output corresponding to the number of words following it plus one (or just one if ""dax"" is the only word). If ""dax"" is at the end or in the middle, ""green"" appears once in the corresponding position in the output.

Furthermore, other words in the sequences translate to other colors, e.g., ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" and ""zup"" both appear to translate to a sequence of ""yellow."" Here's the pattern I deduced:

- Every occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
- The output color for ""dax"" is independent of its position within the input sequence.
- ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" in the output, and there's a one-to-one correspondence between the number of ""dax"" occurrences and the number of ""greens"" in the output.

   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. In the second example ""lug dax zup"", the output is ""blue green yellow"".

Seeing these examples, let's establish the initial mapping for the nonce words we can infer from consistent patterns:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Now, let's try to figure out what ""bluf"" means based on this mapping and the patterns that emerge as it is included within different inputs.

Looking at the first input-output pair, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is associated with ""red,"" and the output is two reds instead of one. Similarly, in the second output, two ""bluf""s follow a ""wif,"" producing two additional ""red"" in the output, doubling the number of expected ""red.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" sandwiched between ""zup"" and ""wif"" results in two yellows followed by a red, suggesting that ""bluf"" induces a duplication of the color that precedes it.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which is ""red"") and the output is again two reds.

In the last example where only ""dax"" and ""bluf"" are present, we have two occurrences of green, hinting that indeed ""bluf"" caused the duplication of the preceding color term.

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the color associated with the word prior to ""bluf.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs to their outputs:

1. The presence of ""wif bluf"" consistently translates to ""red red.""
2. The word ""zup"" alone translates to ""yellow.""
3. The word ""dax"" alone translates to ""green.""
4. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""

Observing these patterns, we can infer the following rule:

bluf -> duplicates the color of the word before it.

Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it duplicates ""red,"" and when it follows ""dax,"" it duplicates ""green."" There is no instance of ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" but based on the rule, it would likely result in ""yellow yellow.""",-0.760298034332697,160,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns within the given examples. Let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"" and the corresponding output colors.

1. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
2. ""wif bluf"" within a longer sequence (""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"") still corresponds to ""red red"" at the end.
3. ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red""
4. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
5. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""

From these observations, we can deduce a pattern regarding the word ""bluf"":
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" precedes the word ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

There isn't a clear, consistent output for ""bluf"" across different positions and contexts. However, one pattern that does emerge is that ""bluf"" tends to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes or follows it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the nearest neighboring word, whether it precedes or follows ""bluf.""

There is no example provided with ""bluf"" directly following ""zup,"" so we can't conclude its translation in that context. Therefore, without further context or examples, ""bluf"" means ""red"" when following ""wif"" and means ""green"" when directly following or coming after ""dax.""",-1.0543190668528082,160,bluf
"Observing the patterns, every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red."" On all occasions, ""bluf"" directly translates to a single ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Additionally, we see that when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" without any word in between, the output for ""dax"" changes from ""green"" to ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might cause duplication of the output color for the word immediately preceding it.

However, to confirm that ""bluf"" causes duplication of the output color of the word that precedes it, we would need to see ""bluf"" following a word other than ""dax"" that does not normally lead to ""red."" Since all examples provided have ""bluf"" associated only with the color ""red"" or following ""dax,"" which is consistently ""green,"" we cannot conclusively determine that it causes duplication of the preceding word's color in general.

Given the examples provided, the most consistent rule we can extract is that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red",-1.1351404109146068,160,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each input and the corresponding output in sequence. We will look for a pattern in the transformations, considering the words before and after ""walm"" and their corresponding color translations.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

For each usage of ""walm,"" we can observe the following rules:

1. The output color red immediately follows the word ""walm"" in each example.
2. The word preceding ""walm"" does not have a consistent color in the output (lug -> blue, wif -> red, dax -> green), suggesting that ""walm"" does not translate to the same color as the preceding word.
3. The word that comes after ""walm"" does not correlate directly to red in other contexts, so ""walm"" isn't causing a color repeat of the subsequent word either.
4. The word ""walm"" itself consistently results in multiple reds being output in succession, indicating that ""walm"" likely corresponds to a repetitive function—specifically, a repetition of the color red.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" translates into a series of red outputs, specifically, three reds in a row. The instances following ""walm,"" such as lug or dax, resume their original color mappings after this series of reds.

Hence, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> a series of three red colors in the output.",-0.06994136069471275,160,walm
"Examining the given examples, we can figure out the meaning of the word ""walm"" based on the pattern of colors appearing before and after it. Let's break down each input and its corresponding output:

Input 2: zup wif walm lug 
Output 2: yellow red red red blue

Input 3: zup dax walm zup wif 
Output 3: yellow green green green yellow red

Input 4: wif walm dax zup 
Output 4: red red red green yellow

Input 5: dax wif walm 
Output 5: green red red red

From these examples, we notice that the output word after ""walm"" is identical to the output word that appears immediately before it. Therefore, ""walm"" causes the color immediately before it to repeat.

Rule: walm -> causes repeated color of the word that appears immediately before it in the input.",-0.08776530463138298,160,walm
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color that comes after it in the sequence. To confirm this, let's look at each example:

- lug walm wif lug bluf: translates as blue blue blue red blue blue. ""walm wif"" resulted in three blues in a row.
- zup wif walm lug: translates as yellow red red red blue. ""walm lug"" resulted in three reds in a row.
- zup dax walm zup wif: translates as yellow green green green yellow red. ""walm zup"" resulted in three greens in a row.
- wif walm dax zup: translates as red red red green yellow. ""walm dax"" resulted in three reds in a row.
- dax wif walm: translates as green red red red. ""walm"" at the end resulted in three reds in a row.

In each case, the word ""walm"" caused the next color word to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to be repeated three times.",-0.09121813710680853,160,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples focusing on its position and the corresponding output each time:

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
3. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

Analyzing these, we can see that:

- In the first example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the sequence ""walm wif"" translates to ""blue red."" 
- In the second example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" with ""walm"" in between ""wif walm lug"" translating to ""red red blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and the sequence ""walm zup wif"" as ""green yellow red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and the sequence ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""walm"" appears at the end, yielding ""red red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" translates to ""red red"" when followed by another color word, except when it is followed by ""wif,"" it translates to a single ""red."" Thus, it seems to generally indicate the repetition of the color ""red"" before it, except when followed by ""wif,"" when it only indicates one ""red.""

1. dax wif -> green red
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. lug dax -> blue green
4. wif lug dax -> red blue green
5. dax zup -> green yellow

From these examples, it appears that each word in the input maps to a specific color in the output and that ""dax"" consistently produces the color green in the output regardless of its position. Thus, we can propose the following rule:

dax -> green

3. Input: lug dax – Output: blue green
4. Input: wif lug dax – Output: red blue green
5. Input: dax zup – Output: green yellow

In all examples, the appearance of ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"" in the output. It does not seem to matter where ""dax"" is located in the input; its corresponding output is always ""green.""

""dax"" is always followed by another word in the input, and the output for that other word appears to correspond to specific color:

- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" was not directly followed by ""dax,"" but by analyzing the second example, it seems to correlate with ""red"" as well.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif

From the examples, we can observe that when the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, there seems to be a repeated color in the output corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and with ""bluf"" following it, the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows a ""lug,"" resulting in an additional ""blue"" in the output, following the pattern ""blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""

However, in the third example, we see ""wif"" translating to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is two ""red"" instead of one. This can be interpreted as ""bluf"" doubling the output of the word that comes before it.

Putting all the observations together, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word preceding it to be repeated once more in the output.

Input: dax wif bluf

- ""Dax"" again maps to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" but here ""bluf"" maps to ""red"" instead of green.

1. Input: dax wif lug
   Output: green red blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

2. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   Analysis: ""dax"" is still ""green"", ""lug"" appears to be ""blue"" again, ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""bluf"" is ""red"".

3. Input: wif bluf lug

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup

Rule: zup -> yellow,-1.808565608951351,162,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the output when ""bluf"" is an input in comparison to other words to see if a pattern emerges.

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue."" 
2. When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
3. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where it can be noted ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and yields ""blue blue.""
4. ""lug bluf wif"" gives us ""blue blue red.""
5. ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" provides ""yellow red red yellow blue,"" with ""bluf"" following ""wif"" yielding ""red red.""

It appears that ""bluf"" correlates to a color being repeated twice. The color that is output for ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the previous word:

- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is blue (""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"").
- If ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" it results in blue being the next color and also being repeated (""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue"").
- There isn't a direct example of ""wif"" preceding ""bluf,"" but ""lug bluf wif"" indicates that after ""bluf"" comes ""wif"" and the output is ""red,"" hence it could imply ""wif"" follows bluf, resulting in ""wif"" being ""red.""

However, we have a case where ""bluf"" is at the end in ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" and the output is ""yellow red red yellow blue."" Since the final blue is not doubled, it infers that ""bluf"" means doubling the color that would otherwise follow the word before ""bluf."" This is not applying when ""bluf"" is the last word, possibly because there's no subsequent word whose color should be doubled.

Based on this, the rule can be defined as follows:

"Rule: bluf -> repeated color word that corresponds to the preceding color word.

"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color that directly precedes it. If the preceding word represents a color, bluf takes on that color and repeats it.",-1.8704423771345247,162,bluf

"Based on the examples given, we can attempt to induce the rules for the nonce word ""walm"". It seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of a color word. The color that is repeated appears to be determined by the word just before ""walm"". 

If we consider the outputs:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
3. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
4. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
5. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

We can derive the following associations:

- ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated.
- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red"" repeated.
- ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" repeated.
- ""lug"" seems to not have a direct effect on ""walm,"" but ""wif"" does, leading to ""red"" repeated after it.

Thus, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color word that is associated with the preceding word, not ""lug,"" as ""lug"" is not immediately prior to ""walm"" in the given outputs.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" results in the output of a color word repeated three times. The color word repeated is the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm"". If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is ""yellow."" If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is ""red."" If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is ""green."" If ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" (from ""lug"") followed by ""red"" (from ""wif"") repeated. The exact number of repetitions seems to depend on the number of nonce words prior to ""walm."" There may also be a modifier effect where the presence of ""dax"" may alter the pattern slightly by inserting ""green"" into the sequence.",-0.0887376488317172,162,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the mapping from input to output colors for each example:

1. `zup walm` -> `yellow yellow yellow`
2. `lug wif walm` -> `blue red red red`
3. `wif walm dax zup wif lug walm` -> `red red red green yellow red blue blue blue`
4. `dax zup walm wif walm` -> `green yellow yellow yellow red red red`
5. `lug wif dax walm zup` -> `blue red green green green yellow`

From the examples given, we notice a pattern:
- The word that precedes ""walm"" is represented by a color, and ""walm"" causes a repetition of that color in the output.
- The number of repetitions depends on an implicit order assigned to the words.

Let's identify the order and the repetitions:
- ""zup walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" to which corresponds ""yellow,"" and we see ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""lug wif walm"" has ""wif"" before ""walm,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" we have ""wif"" before the first ""walm,"" repeating ""red"" three times, and ""lug"" before the second ""walm,"" repeating ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" includes ""zup"" before the first ""walm,"" repeating ""yellow"" three times, and ""wif"" before the second ""walm,"" with ""red"" repeated three times.
- Finally, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" has ""dax"" before ""walm,"" and ""green"" repeated three times.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule for repetitions:
- Regardless of which word precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of the corresponding color.

We therefore deduce the meaning of ""walm"" in the context of these examples as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.",-0.09017240034761617,162,walm
"To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in input and the corresponding output. Taking the input and output pairs, we can try to correlate each word with a color:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Now, examining the instances of ""walm"" and their outputs:

- In each case, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word for the number of times equal to the output for ""wif.""

From the given examples:

- In ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times, similar to the output for ""zup.""
- In ""lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red"" being repeated four times, which is the output for ""wif.""
- In ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" the first ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times after ""wif,"" and the second ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated four times after ""lug.""
- In ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" the first ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and repeats ""yellow"" three times, and the second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats ""red"" three times.
- In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" four times before it moves on to ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word for the number of times equal to the output for ""wif"" (which is three repetitions).",-0.44470856039658585,162,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the input and output. Let's analyze the outputs in relation to the word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" 
- In the second example, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red.""
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow.""

Now let's focus on the number of times the color is repeated when ""walm"" is used:

- ""zup walm"" -> output is ""yellow"" repeated 3 times.
- ""wif walm"" -> output is ""red"" repeated 3 times.
- ""lug wif walm"" -> includes ""wif"" before ""walm,"" thus ""red"" is repeated 4 times, including ""lug"" results in ""blue"" plus three repeats of ""red.""
- It seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Analyzing further to validate this rule:

- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three ""red."" Then ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm,"" ending with three ""blue.""
- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""walm"" gives three ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" (red) followed by ""walm"" gives three ""red.""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm,"" hence three ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" (yellow).

Based on the above information, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

So, walm -> meaning: repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.47194399526454534,162,walm
"The examples provided seem to correlate with a specific pattern that involves repeating a color word based on the other color words mentioned before the nonce word 'walm.' Analyzing the inputs and their respective outputs, we can approach the following observations:

- The words 'zup,' 'wif,' 'lug,' and 'dax' appear to correspond to specific colors. From the outputs, we can infer that 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' and 'dax' corresponds to 'green.'
  
- The nonce word 'walm' seems to trigger the repetition of the color that is mentioned immediately before it. This repetition's length depends on the number of 'walm' occurrences and any color words appearing directly before it.

Here is the rule induction based on your examples:

- 'zup walm' repeated 'yellow' three times, which suggests that 'zup' means 'yellow' and 'walm' is repeating the previous color three times.
- 'lug wif walm' resulted in 'blue red red red,' which means that 'lug' is 'blue,' 'wif' is 'red,' and 'walm' repeated 'red' three times.
- In the example 'wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,' 'walm' repeated 'red' three times and then 'blue' three times, after 'wif' and 'lug,' respectively.
- The pattern is consistent across all the examples given, with the color word before 'walm' being repeated three times.

2. Similarly, ""dax lug wif walm"" transforms into ""green blue red red red,"" where once again ""walm"" correlates with the sequence ""red red red.""

4. ""dax walm"" solely corresponds to ""green green green,"" reinforcing the pattern that ""walm"" after ""dax"" translates to three greens.
5. Lastly, ""lug wif walm"" gives us ""blue red red red,"" again showing that ""walm"" after ""lug wif"" leads to ""red red red.""

"Analyzing the given input and output sequences, it seems that the word ""walm"" translates into a series of colors. Here's the breakdown:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears, the color ""red"" is repeated multiple times in the output.
2. The number of times ""red"" appears seems to correlate with the number of words that precede ""walm"" within the same input sequence.
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" while ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
4. Based on the above, it seems that ""walm"" causes the last color mentioned before it to repeat, and the count of repetitions equals the number of distinct words preceding ""walm"" minus one (since ""walm"" itself is not counted).

For example:
- In the first input, there are three unique words before ""walm"" (""lug bluf wif""), which means there are three reds in the output after the last color mentioned (""red"").
- In the second input, ""dax lug wif walm"" leads to one iteration of ""green"" followed by the repetition of ""red"" three times, as there are three words before ""walm"".
- In the third input, ""dax"" is the only word before the first ""walm,"" repeating ""green"" twice after the first instance of green (three greens total), and as ""wif"" is the last word before the second ""walm"", ""red"" follows.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the last mentioned color as many times as the number of unique words that precede ""walm"" in the sequence, not counting ""walm"" itself.",-0.8670317799293256,163,walm

By analyzing the ""Output"" with regards to each additional word provided in the ""Input"" alongside ""wif,"" we can attempt to induce the meaning or function of ""wif.""

Here's what we can observe:

1. ""wif lug"" consistently results in ""red blue.""
2. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""
3. ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow.""
4. When ""wif"" is presented alone, the output is simply ""red.""

From the pattern in the output, it seems that ""wif"" always produces the color ""red."" This happens irrespective of the following word or even if there is no following word.

The second part of the output, where the second color appears, seems to be dependent on the second word in the ""Input"":

- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" correlates with a repeated ""red,"" which could either be a direct correlation or signify that ""bluf"" is not associated with a new color and therefore doesn't change the initial ""red.""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

Since the word ""wif"" itself, without any additional context, yields ""red,"" we can infer that ""wif"" has a baseline output of ""red."" The additional word then either modifies this output by adding another color or reinforces the initial color based on some correlation.

Based on this evidence, the rule for ""wif"" could be stated as follows:

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

However, there is not enough variety in the examples to ascertain a specific pattern that matches each input word to an output color. There is only one instance for each of the input words ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

With the given information, the clearest rule we can form is:

We observe that the output seems to repeat a color for each occurrence of a word in the input before the word ""walm"" and then for ""walm"" itself. Specifically,
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" does not appear to have a corresponding output 

We do not have an example where ""walm"" is the first word, so it's impossible to deduce its standalone output from these examples alone. However, the overall pattern including ""walm"" is that the word before ""walm"" has its color repeated according to the position of ""walm."" Specifically:
- When ""walm"" is the second word, the first word's associated color is repeated twice, and then ""walm"" gets that same color once.
- When ""walm"" is the third word, the first and second word's associated color is repeated twice before and once for ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is the second word and only one word precedes it, the color is repeated three times, once for the preceding word and twice for ""walm.""

With this pattern, we deduce the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to the color red. However, in the context of being placed after the word ""wif,"" it changes to result in two instances of the color red instead of one.

Let's examine each provided example to identify the pattern:

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in red.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""bluf"" is the last word and results in double red, following a ""wif"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" after ""wif"" and results in one instance of yellow.

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" and gives double red before ""lug"".

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" is the last word and follows ""zup"" resulting in double yellow.

From these examples, we see two patterns. The first pattern is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red. The second pattern is that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it results in double red, but when it comes after other words, it might relate to a different set of rules determining the output color. However, these additional rules are not consistently illustrated with the given examples. 

To form a coherent rule, we might need more data. But with the current information, we can establish the following:

Rule: 
- ""bluf"" generally corresponds to red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to double red.

Hence, we can define bluf as generally representing the color red, with a specific rule when following ""wif"" leading to a duplication of red in the output:

bluf -> red (with the specific rule following ""wif"" resulting in red red).",-0.07154059980527498,165,bluf
"Reviewing the examples provided:

1. dax bluf wif -> green green red
2. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
3. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
4. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
5. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow

Now, we want to determine the rule for ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""red"" after three ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the fourth word and the second ""yellow"".

Based on these examples, it seems that the placement of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to its position in the output and the color that follows. It could be that ""bluf"" is an indicator for a change or interruption in the sequence of colors. More specifically, ""bluf"" results in repeating the color that follows its position in the sequence. Considering this pattern:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that follows ""bluf"" in the output sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last word, repeat the last color in the sequence (assuming the color sequence repeats the pattern from the input sequence).",-0.1506631482562249,165,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we observe that the output color changes according to the position of the word that comes after ""bluf"". The color associated with ""bluf"" is 'red' when ""wif"" follows it, and 'yellow' when ""zup"" follows it. However, there are instances where the presence of ""lug"" after ""bluf"" leads to the color ""blue"" in the output, and no example contradicts this relationship. 

It's also worth noting that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all examples, whether it comes before or after ""bluf"". Based on the available data, we can't definitively state whether ""bluf"" changes its meaning solely due to the words that come after it, or if there is an extra rule at play because of the consistent presence of the word ""lug"" leading to the color ""blue"".

Nonetheless, given the examples at hand, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:
- When followed by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When followed by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- When followed by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Without a counterexample where ""bluf"" is followed by a different word, or an additional example showing a different output when ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"" (e.g., ""bluf lug"" without another word in between), we cannot be certain there isn't another underlying rule that determines its meaning beyond the context of the subsequent word.

Hence, the tentative rule for ""bluf"" is:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can observe the outputs associated with each input containing ""bluf."" We want to find a consistent pattern for the word ""bluf"" that aligns with the outputs across all examples.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by two ""red"" in the output, although there's an additional color (""blue"") present; this could indicate a possible interaction with the preceding word ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, but here it is preceded by ""zup,"" which alone seems to correspond to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output when following ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" in the output.

From the above observations, we see that the color associated with ""bluf"" is not consistent; however, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it or is related to it in some way.

In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" which leads to ""red red."" In the fourth example, it is just ""red,"" which might imply a rule regarding the number of preceding words linked to ""bluf.""

Taking into account these observations, and considering the repeated occurrence of the color of the previous word when ""bluf"" is used, a possible rule for ""bluf"" could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""meaning"" is that ""bluf"" repeats the output color of the word that precedes it in the input sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" triggers the repetition in output of the color associated with the word preceding it, until a different color word is mentioned. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. The sequence ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated until a new color word ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") appears, and then the sequence closes with ""dax"" again for ""green"".

2. In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", the output is ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". After ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated. No new color word appears between ""walm"" and ""lug"", so ""walm"" triggers the repetition of ""yellow"" until ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue"".

3. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"". After ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""red"".

4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". After the first ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" until ""zup"" (yellow) appears, and after the second ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" again without a new color word interrupting.

5. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". After ""zup"" (yellow), the ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated until the color sequence is changed by ""wif"" (red).

Rule:
walm -> Triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word until a new color word is mentioned. If no new color word is present after ""walm"", it keeps repeating the last color mentioned before it.",-0.06596067690451453,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns before and after its occurrence in the input sentences and how those patterns relate to the output color sequences.

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, ""red"" appears in the output. Moreover, each time ""walm"" is in the input, a sequence of ""red"" starts until a different word (not previously mentioned in the sequence before walm) appears in the input, upon which the output returns to assigning unique colors to unique words (e.g., lug -> blue, dax -> green, etc.).

Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif dax"" 
   Output: green green green red green
   - The sequence ""green red green"" follows the word ""walm,"" indicating ""walm"" causes ""red"" to begin, but as ""dax"" was already mentioned before ""walm"", and ""dax"" is green, the sequence ends at ""wif"" with the reappearance of ""dax"" matching its prior color of green.

2. Input: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug""
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""Yellow"" begins with ""walm"" and continues until ""lug,"" which has previously appeared, returns to its original color of blue.

3. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""Red"" appears after ""walm,"" and no new input word that appeared before ""walm"" is provided to end the ""red"" sequence.

4. Input: ""lug walm zup lug walm""
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - The sequence goes back to blue after ""zup"" because ""lug,"" which has appeared before ""walm,"" is repeated.

5. Input: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug""
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - After ""walm,"" ""red"" starts and goes on until ""wif"" reappears, which has been colored red, and the sequence reverts to the original colors with the reappearance of ""lug"" as blue.

From these observations, we can state the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> initiates a sequence of ""red"" in the output, which continues until a word that was mentioned prior to ""walm"" in the input sequence reappears, upon which the output reverts to assigning the original colors to words.",-0.07384256378446606,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns of colors associated with the word in the given examples.

In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with red, since ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green,"" where the only red appears right after ""wif."" Notably, after ""walm,"" the pattern is green-red-green, indicating that ""walm"" might be acting as a modifier to the following word, or it might simply be reiterating the color of the word that precedes it. Since ""dax"" is associated with green, it seems that ""walm"" is causing the pattern to repeat until a new color (""wif"" -> red) appears.

The second example has the pattern ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" yielding the output ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""bluf"" with blue as well, ""dax"" with green, and ""zup"" with yellow. The appearance of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in repeating yellow before ""lug"" changes it to blue. This supports the idea that maybe ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it until a new color name appears.

The third example, ""zup wif walm,"" which transforms into ""yellow red red red,"" again supports the rule. ""Zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is red. After ""walm,"" red repeats. 

In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" Before and after each occurrence of ""walm,"" blue appears, reinforcing the pattern of the preceding color recurring after ""walm.""

Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" which translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"" again shows that after ""walm,"" the color that precedes it (yellow from ""zup"") repeats until a new color word changes the pattern.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to repeat in the sequence until a new color word appears.",-0.07769280139640777,165,walm
"Based on the provided examples, let's try to figure out what ""walm"" means by looking for patterns.

In the first example, ""dax walm wif dax"" translates to ""green green green red green."" Walm seems to change the color associated with ""wif"" from red to green, while the color for ""dax"" remains green.

In the second example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" After ""walm,"" the color associated with ""lug"" changes from blue to yellow and then goes back to blue after ""walm"" has stopped its effect. So here, ""walm"" seems to temporarily change the color associated with ""lug"" from blue to yellow.

In the third example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Walm doesn't seem to change the color for ""zup"" which remains yellow, but it changes ""wif"" from red to red, indicating no change in color in this case.

In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" After the first ""walm,"" ""zup"" changes to ""blue,"" but after the second ""walm,"" there doesn't seem to be a change. This is inconsistent with previous interpretations and might suggest ""walm"" has a contextual effect or perhaps a mistake in the example.

In the fifth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" After ""walm,"" the colors associated with ""wif"" and ""lug"" are both yellow then return to their original colors.

Taking all the examples into account, there seems to be an error in the fourth example based on the pattern from other examples. Here is the deduced rule:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the color associated with the nonce word that immediately follows it to the color associated with the word after ""walm."" This effect continues until ""walm"" appears again, which stops the effect of the first ""walm,"" and the colors revert to their original associations. However, if there is a new color word between two appearances of ""walm,"" its usual association does not change. Based on this rule, it looks like there's a contradiction or a typographical error in the provided output for the fourth example where it does not reverts back to 'lug' color, which is supposed to be 'blue'. It should be ""blue blue blue blue blue blue blue"" instead. There might also be an additional unstated rule for cases when ""walm"" occurs twice or has some nuances dependent on the sequence or placement relative to other colors.

So, walm -> meaning: A rule that temporarily changes the color associations of nonce words until another instance of ""walm"" appears. The effect is applied to the nonce word that follows it and any subsequent same nonce words until the effect is reset.",-0.07993725490038829,165,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has a particular meaning related to the words that come before it. By examining the patterns, we can attempt to derive its meaning.

Analyzing the Outputs, when ""walm"" is present, it seems the color that immediately follows it is a repetition of the last mentioned color in an Output string sequence before ""walm"" is introduced:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif dax"", the Output sequence is ""green green green red green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" follows and we get an extra ""green"" before the sequence changes.
  
- In the second example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", the Output is ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""Lug"" before ""walm"" is ""blue"" and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" being repeated, implying ""walm"" may be causing the repetition.

- In the third example, ""zup wif walm"", the Output is ""yellow red red red"". After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated.

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"", the Output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". Again, ""walm"" occurs, and the result is a repetition of ""blue"" except for when ""zup"" introduces ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", the Output is ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". After ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

Considering these observations, we can derive the following rule: 

Rule: When ""walm"" is introduced after a word, it causes the Output to repeat the color corresponding to the last word before ""walm."" If there's a word after ""walm"" that changes the color, the new sequence will start with that color.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" appears between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" and ""green"" appears between ""red"" and ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" appears at the beginning, and ""green"" is the first color.
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" but we have no other examples to confirm this.

3. Input: lug zup dax lug dax
   Output: blue yellow green blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and appears twice, at the beginning and after ""zup,"" indicating position-based consistency.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the first example.
   - ""dax"" appears twice, both times followed by ""green.""

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" consistent with previous examples.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" consistent with the first example.
   - ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and ""green"" follows in the output.
   - ""bluf"" is a new word, but it corresponds to ""green."" However, since ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" doesn't provide additional information about ""dax.""

5. Input: zup lug dax
   Output: yellow blue green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" consistent with the previous examples.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" consistent with the previous examples.
   - ""dax"" appears after ""zup"" and ""lug,"" with ""green"" following in the output.

Based on these observations, regardless of its position, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green."" There is no indication that the meaning of ""dax"" changes depending on context or position.

2. In the second example, 'dax walm' consistently translates to 'green green green'. Since 'dax' is followed by 'walm', which is not defined, but the output is 'green', we could hypothesize that 'walm' could be irrelevant, and 'dax' still means 'green'.

3. In the third example, 'dax' follows 'zup' and then is followed by 'lug'. This produces 'green' after 'yellow' and before 'blue'. Again, 'dax' seems to indicate 'green'.

4. In the fourth example, 'lug' precedes and follows 'dax', which corresponds to 'blue' before and after 'green'. All evidence points to 'dax' meaning green.

The word ""lug"" is consistently producing ""blue,"" and again ""walm"" seems to also produce ""blue,"" followed by the pattern-breaking ""wif"" which yields ""red."" ""Bluf"" at the end goes back to the original color ""blue.""

In the third example:
Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
Here ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and once again ""walm"" produces ""blue."" ""Wif"" breaks the pattern with ""red,"" and ""dax"" resumes with ""green.""

In the fourth example:
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
""Wif"" gives us ""red,"" and ""walm"" continues with ""red"" despite previously breaking patterns.

In the last example:
Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
""Zup"" generates ""yellow,"" ""walm"" again produces ""yellow,"" followed by another color ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug.""

From these observations, it seems the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the previous word unless the previous word is ""wif,"" which appears to be a pattern breaker, after which ""walm"" starts a new color sequence based on the word after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the prior word unless that word is ""wif,"" in which case it follows the color of the word after ""wif.""",-0.10532728637004762,166,walm

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare each input containing ""bluf"" with its corresponding output, looking for patterns that might help us understand what ""bluf"" translates to:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup

2. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" In the output, the word following ""yellow"" is also ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" In the output, the word following ""blue"" is also ""blue.""
- In example 2 again, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" In the output, the word following ""green"" is also ""green.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" In the output, the word following ""red"" is also ""red.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is the last word, and it follows ""lug,"" which again translates to ""blue."" The last color in the output is also ""blue.""

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color represented by the word just before it. Therefore, ""bluf"" functions as a repeat of the preceding color in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",-0.057643771438195865,167,bluf

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color is red (example 1, 3 & 4).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is blue (example 2 & 5).

Based on this information, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it.

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that directly precedes it.

- In the 1st example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow""; ""bluf"" takes the color of the previous word ""zup"" (yellow).
- In the 2nd example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" and ""zup bluf"" to ""yellow yellow""; again, ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

- In the 4th example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""; ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""wif"" which is red.
- In the 5th example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue""; ""bluf"" matches the color of the preceding word ""lug"" (blue).

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be replication of the color of the immediately preceding word.

bluf -> meaning: The color word directly preceding ""bluf"".",-0.7520163198713407,167,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" is associated with the following colors:

Example 1:

If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which translates to red, then ""bluf"" will also be red. There isn't a specific color tied to ""bluf""; instead, it takes on the color of the preceding word.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. Looking for patterns, we can consider that each word converts to a color and ""bluf"" appears multiple times with the same color output. The following analysis can be made:
 
- In the first example, the word ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" when following ""lug"" and ""yellow"" when followed by ""dax.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it is followed by ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, there is only ""wif"" and ""bluf"" and both are ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is again ""blue,"" and it once more follows ""lug."" 

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color output. Instead, it seems to mimic (or take on) the color associated with another word. In the second and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue,"" indicating that it might be copying the color associated with ""lug."" In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and both are ""red,"" showing the same copying behavior. However, this is slightly contradicted by the third example, where ""dax bluf wif"" produces ""green red,"" but this might imply that the rule of ""bluf"" mimicking the color takes precedence when a specific condition is met.

To summarize a potential rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word it follows or precedes under certain conditions, which are not entirely clear from the given examples. More examples would be needed for complete rule induction. ",-0.9791879973243299,167,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a color that is repeated multiple times. The color appears to correspond to the color indicated by the word that precedes ""walm,"" and the number of times the color is repeated after ""walm"" matches the number of times the preceding color word appears in the input.

Let us review the examples to figure out the rule:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and appears twice before ""walm."" ""Wif"" translates to ""red"" and appears once before ""walm."" Following ""walm,"" we see ""red"" repeated three times – matching the number of times ""red"" precedes ""walm.""

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" ""Walm"" occurs after ""zup"" and the output is three ""yellow,"" which matches the number of times ""yellow"" precedes ""walm.""

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""Lug"" translates to ""blue."" Since ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times, matching the number of times ""blue"" precedes ""walm"" (in this case, once but repeated threefold).

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Both ""dax"" and ""lug"" appear twice before ""walm."" However, ""lug"" is the most recent word before ""walm,"" thus ""blue"" is the color that is repeated in the output, and the number of times ""blue"" appears matches the total occurrences of ""lug"" — four times.

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   ""Lug"" translates to ""blue"" and appears before ""walm."" After ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times, consistent with the repetition rule.

So, the rule seems to be:

**Walm** -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word that appears directly before ""walm,"" and does so as many times as the word for that color has appeared in the sequence up to the point where ""walm"" appears.

Rule: If a color word is followed by the nonce word ""walm,"" then in the output the corresponding color will be repeated as many times as the color word appeared before ""walm.""",-0.07688787870408338,167,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" dictates the output color and the number of times that color is repeated. The color corresponds to the word prior to ""walm"" in the input, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times that color has appeared before ""walm"" plus one. We can induce the following rules for ""walm"":

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it produces the color yellow, repeated for each occurrence of ""zup"" plus one.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it produces the color blue, repeated for each occurrence of ""lug"" plus one.
- ""dax"" translates to ""green."" When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it produces the color green, repeated for each occurrence of ""dax"" plus one.

Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Rule: ""bluf"" must translate to ""red."" The output is red repeated three times (because red appears twice before ""walm"" and once for ""walm"" itself).

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Rule: We know ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" ""Walm"" following ""zup"" produces two additional yellows (one ""zup"" before ""walm"" + one for ""walm"" itself).

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: ""Lug"" correlates with blue, so ""walm"" after one ""lug"" produces two more blues (one ""lug"" before ""walm"" + one for ""walm"" itself).

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Rule: The sequence ""dax lug"" translates to green and blue respectively. Following the second ""lug,"" ""walm"" produces ""blue"" three times (twice for the occurrences of ""lug"" + once for ""walm"").

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   Rule: ""Lug"" produces blue, with ""walm"" following, it triples the ""blue."" The subsequent ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correlate with red repeats; ""walm"" doesn't have influence on them as it occurred before.

In conclusion, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be a rule for repeating the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, and the number of repetitions is determined by the number of times the preceding color word appeared before ""walm"" in the input sequence plus one for the instance of ""walm"" itself.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that precedes it, adding one extra repetition for the occurrence of ""walm.""",-0.08953041663829764,167,walm
"walm -> repeat the last color mentioned

Rule: When the term ""walm"" occurs in an input, it triggers the repetition of the last color that appeared, continuing for a length equal to the number of words that preceded ""walm."" The following examples illustrate this:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
(Rule application: ""red"" is repeated three times because there are three words before ""walm"".)

Input: dax lug dax lug walm

Input: lug walm wif bluf

"Analyzing the examples provided, we can infer the following:

1. The presence of ""walm"" in the input correlates with a consistent color in the output.
2. The color in the output is dependent on the word immediately preceding ""walm"".
3. The output color is repeated multiple times, the number of which is based on the word before ""walm"".

Here is what we observe from the specific examples:

- In the first example (""zup bluf wif walm""), ""walm"" causes the output to become a sequence of ""red red red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif"", and the color is repeated thrice.
- In the second example (""zup walm dax""), ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" corresponding to the color for ""zup,"" repeated thrice, with a ""green"" at the end for ""dax.""
- In the third example (""lug walm""), ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which correlates with ""lug"" being represented by blue and repeated thrice.
- In the fourth example (""dax lug dax lug walm""), ""walm"" causes the output to end with ""blue blue,"" linked to the previous word ""lug"" and repeated twice since ""lug"" is the final word before ""walm"" and appeared twice consecutively before ""walm.""
- In the fifth example (""lug walm wif bluf""), ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" associated with ""lug,"" repeated thrice, followed by the respective colors for ""wif"" and ""bluf.""

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to include a series of the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm."" The color repeats as many times as the word preceding ""walm"" appears in a row before ""walm.""

Based on this rule, the meaning of ""walm"" could be deduced as follows:

walm -> Meaning: a command that repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word, with the number of repetitions based on the number of consecutive appearances of that word before ""walm.""",-0.4607447796706308,167,walm
"Based on the given examples, each word in the input seems to correspond to a color in the output. The color output does not change within the same line, unless a new word is introduced. Therefore, we could surmise that each unique word corresponds to a different color. The word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it multiple times. Let's observe this pattern:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> The color before ""walm"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".
2. ""zup walm dax"" -> The color before ""walm"" is ""yellow"", and ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow"".
3. ""lug walm"" -> The color before ""walm"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue"".
4. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> The color before ""walm"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue"".
5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> The color before ""walm"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue"".

Thus, it seems that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color represented by the word before it. The number of repetitions may depend on the position of ""walm"" or it might simply double the color occurrence, though the examples don't provide a clear rule for the exact number of repetitions. However, since each ""walm"" at least doubled the previous color, we can infer the following:

Rule: Walm causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to repeat at least once more.

4. Input: lug wif bluf

5. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax

To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each occurrence and its output. In every case where ""bluf"" appears, the word that precedes it has a color associated with it that is repeated in the output immediately following ""bluf"":

1. ""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow

2. ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue

4. ""wif bluf"" -> red red

""Bulf"" may mean to repeat the color of the preceding word. Let's check this with the more complex examples:

2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which correlates to ""yellow"" and outputs yellow directly after ""bluf"".

5. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""
Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which correlates to ""red"" and thus outputs red directly after.

The rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: Repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding ""bluf"".

3. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
4. Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
5. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue yellow red red green

From these samples, ""bluf"" appears to match with the word that precedes it (looking at the color that corresponds to the preceding word in the output):

- ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"": ""yellow yellow""
- ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"": ""blue blue""
- In the instance with ""wif"" preceding ""bluf"" (""lug wif bluf""), the output is ""blue red red,"" which isn't as straightforward because ""bluf"" doesn't repeat ""red"" immediately after. However, this might be because the repetition rule for ""bluf"" has been broken by the presence of ""wif"".

Given that in every other instance apart from the presence of ""wif,"" ""bluf"" translates into a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes right before it, we can surmise that:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. If the word preceding ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" instead. This rule could be broken or modified due to the presence of ""wif,"" but with the given examples, we cannot deduce more than this without additional context or data.

2. When the word ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" which again shows that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively. The Output for ""bluf"" here is ""yellow yellow red."" However, this example has ""bluf"" only once, so we will consider ""yellow yellow"" as the correct output for ""bluf,"" with the ""red"" corresponding to the following ""wif.""

From the above, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" mirrors the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

So, the meaning is:

bluf -> The color of the preceding word.",-0.8025700319995556,170,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must find common elements in each sequence that could account for the behavior of the word ""walm."" 

We can see that after the ""walm"" word is used, a sequence of color words is repeated three times:

1. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
2. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"". After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
3. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"". Again, after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
4. ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green"". After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
5. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

From these observations, we can infer a rule: the word ""walm"" causes the color word that follows it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the following color word three times.",-0.10656793673780489,170,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to have an effect that repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it three times. Each word appears to have a corresponding color:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Now let's see how this rule applies to each example:

1. In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" the word ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" which is then repeated three times in the output. Following this, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red red"" (despite not having seen ""bluf"" before, the output shows a pattern of two reds following it).

2. In ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and is associated with the color ""red,"" which is then repeated three times. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

3. In ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color ""red,"" repeated three times, while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""red"", repeated three times, followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green.""

5. In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""green,"" which is then repeated three times.

"From the given examples, we can deduce the following associations:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

The word ""walm"" when used in a sequence seems to replicate the color associated with the word that directly follows it. For instance, in

- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"", the output after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- ""zup wif walm lug"", the output after ""walm"" is ""red red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- ""lug wif walm"", the output after ""walm"" is ""red red,"" again corresponding to ""wif.""
- ""wif walm dax"", the output after ""walm"" is ""red red,"" corresponding to ""wif.""
- ""dax walm"", the output after ""walm"" is ""green green,"" corresponding to ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that comes immediately after it in a sequence, and this color is repeated three times.

1. In the first input, ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue"") is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" It seems ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and is repeated three times, which implies that ""walm"" may mean repeat the previous color three times.

2. In the second input, we see ""wif"" before ""walm"" with the output ""red red red red blue."" Since ""lug"" is translated as ""blue,"" it follows that ""wif"" is ""red,"" and again ""walm"" has caused it to be repeated three times before stating the color of ""lug.""

3. In the third input, ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red,"" again showing that ""walm"" caused the previous color (red from ""wif"") to repeat three times.

4. In the fourth input, ""wif walm dax,"" the result is ""red red red green,"" so ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" repeated the previous color (red) three times again.

5. In the fifth input, ""dax walm,"" we only have ""green green green"" as the output, which confirms the pattern of ""walm"" repeating the previous color word three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: it repeats the color of the preceding word three times in the output sequence.

- When ""wif"" appears after ""bluf"" (Input 1), the output is ""red red,"" with the second ""red"" directly correlating to the position of ""wif.""
- Similarly, in Input 2, ""wif"" is followed by a ""red"" in the Output.
- Input 3 introduces ""wif"" between ""bluf"" and ""lug,"" which translate to ""red"" and ""blue"" in the Output, respectively.
- Input 4 affirms the pattern with ""wif"" appearing twice, followed by ""red red.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the relationship between the input and output sequences. Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and since ""bluf"" follows, and the output is also ""red"", we might initially think ""bluf"" also means ""red"".

2. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Since ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow"" again, ""bluf"" may mean repeating the last color mentioned.

3. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" follows with ""blue"" again in the output, ""zup"" then gives ""yellow"". This supports the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color mentioned before it.

4. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" follows with ""green"" again in the output. Here ""wif"" is at the end, giving ""red"" in the output. This further supports the repeat rule for ""bluf"".

5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", ""wif"" with ""red"", and ""zup"" with ""yellow"". The sequence ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow"", with ""bluf"" repeating the ""yellow"" from ""zup"".

Based on the patterns observed, the word ""bluf"" seems to mean that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" should be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.",-0.08858285429523077,171,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the patterns in the given examples where the word ""bluf"" and the corresponding outputs occur:

1. When ""wif bluf"" is given, the output is ""red red"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" follows, it also translates to ""red.""

2. For the input ""wif lug zup bluf,"" the corresponding output is ""red blue yellow yellow"". As per the previous example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow,"" given that there is no new word to correspond to the second ""yellow.""

3. When ""lug bluf zup"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue yellow."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to the second ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

4. For the input ""dax bluf wif,"" the output is ""green green red."" In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following the pattern, ""bluf"" again corresponds to a repetition of the preceding color (""green"").

5. Lastly, the input ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green red green yellow yellow."" From earlier examples, we know ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and thus the ""bluf"" here corresponds to the last ""yellow"".

"Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the previous color repeated. 

Explanation: In each example, the word ""bluf"" is followed by the output of a color that is the same as the color that was translated just before it.

- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" equals the previous color, which is ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup,"" the outputs are respectively ""blue"" repeated as ""blue blue"" and ""yellow"" repeated as ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" the output is ""green green.""
- In the final example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is repeated as ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" giving another ""yellow,"" reflecting the previous color.

"Given the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that immediately precedes it. The output is the color corresponding to the preceding word, repeated as many times as ""bluf"" appears. Here's a breakdown of each example:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is mentioned once, it results in ""red"" being repeated once.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup bluf"" is ""yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is mentioned once, it results in ""yellow"" being repeated as many times as ""bluf"" is mentioned.
- The third example also shows ""bluf"" following ""lug,"" and the output for ""lug bluf"" is ""blue blue."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so the output is ""blue"" repeated as per the occurrence of ""bluf.""
- The fourth and fifth examples fall in line with the rule deduced from the previous examples.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs, focusing on the position and repetition of ""walm"" and the corresponding output.

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is three yellows. ""Zup"" is associated with a single ""yellow."" Since there's a repetition of ""yellow,"" it suggests ""walm"" may indicate repetition of the previous color.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Here ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" and again, the output is a repetition of yellow (""yellow yellow yellow""). ""Dax"" outputs green and ""wif"" outputs red. ""Bluf"" seems to double the last color ""red red."" The rest of the words maintain a one-to-one correspondence with their colors.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

The third example is the same as the first, reinforcing the rule deduced.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is three reds. This is consistent with the rule that ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat three times.

5. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three greens after a single ""green."" The rule appears to hold again.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the previous color three times.",-0.08475901008348316,171,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: ""zup walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   
2. Input: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf""

4. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   
5. Input: ""lug dax walm wif""
   Output: ""blue green green green red""

Looking at the inputs and outputs, we see that each instance of ""walm"" is followed by three repeated colors in the output sequence. Importantly, the color that is repeated three times corresponds to the color of the word directly before ""walm"" in the output:

- In the first and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"". Thus, ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which outputs ""red"". Thus, ""walm"" leads to ""red red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which outputs ""green"". Thus, ""walm"" leads to ""green green green"".

- In the second example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here again, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" and is followed by repeated ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" turns into ""red red red green yellow."" Once more, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, and the output is repeated ""red.""

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug dax walm wif"" becomes ""blue green green green red."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is again repeated ""green.""

2. However, in the second example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax wif bluf,"" which might suggest that ""walm"" does not mean uniquely ""yellow,"" but rather repeats the color emitted by the word before it, in this case, repeating ""yellow"" (from ""zup"") three times.

3. The fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" gives us ""red red red green yellow,"" which supports our previous deduction since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red,"" repeating the color associated with ""wif.""

4. Finally, the fifth example, ""lug dax walm wif,"" outputs ""blue green green green red."" This again fits our deduced rule as ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green green green.""

- ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow,"" indicating that ""dax"" means ""green,"" whereas ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red,"" which implies that ""wif"" means ""red.""
- ""zup wif bluf zup"" results in ""yellow red red yellow,"" showing that ""bluf"" is likely ""red"" and ""zup"" maintains its meaning of ""yellow"" at both occurrences.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example input and its associated output, trying to find a pattern related to the word's placement and the color that results.

1. lug walm wif lug
   blue blue blue red blue
   - Every ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""wif"" to red. The ""walm"" here precedes ""wif"" and results in blue, which is the same as ""lug."" 

2. lug zup walm lug
   blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the color for ""walm"" is yellow, the same as for ""zup."" 

3. lug walm dax wif lug wif
   blue blue blue green red blue red
   - Here, ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and its output is blue. ""dax"" results in green and ""wif"" in red, both different from the output of ""walm.""

4. dax wif walm lug zup
   green red red red blue yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug."" Its output is red, which is the same as ""wif."" 

5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and its output is blue, which is the same as ""lug.""

Based on the above examples, ""walm"" appears to take the color of the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word before it. If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it is blue. If it follows ""wif,"" it is red. If it follows ""zup,"" it is yellow. If it follows ""dax,"" it becomes green. This rule explains each instance of ""walm"" and its associated color in the given examples.",-0.06477641641217481,172,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can see that each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" is followed by a series of identical colors in the corresponding outputs, with the exception of the last color which is different. It appears that ""walm"" may represent a repeating pattern where the first instance of a color is repeated until a different color appears.

Let's analyze each input and output pair to understand the pattern:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"" and then a ""red"", breaking the repetition.

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""walm"" is preceded by ""yellow"" (zup), and ""yellow"" repeats three times before returning to ""blue"".

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""walm"" appears after ""blue"" and the color ""blue"" repeats two more times before changing to ""green"".

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""red"" and the color ""red"" repeats three times before changing to ""blue"".

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""blue"" and ""blue"" is repeated two more times before changing to ""green"".

In all cases, ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the previous color’s appearance until a different color appears in sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input, the previous color in the output is repeated until a different color appears.",-0.092721551754466,172,walm
"Analyzing the Input and Output:

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- 'lug' is consistently translated to 'blue'.
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- The 'walm' here does not seem to correspond to a color as it repeats 'red' which is already associated with 'wif'.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- 'bluf' is not present in the output, suggesting a possible deletion or transformation effect by 'walm'.

From these examples, we can infer several rules:
- 'lug', 'wif', 'dax' and 'zup' consistently correspond to 'blue', 'red', 'green', and 'yellow' respectively.
- When 'walm' is inserted after another word, it does not introduce a new color but seems to influence the next color word:
  - The word after 'walm' is either repeated (increasing its count) or possibly omitted from the output.

Given these observations, we conclude a potential rule for 'walm':
Rule: 'walm' triggers the repetition of the color represented by the word that immediately follows it.

To illustrate:
- 'lug walm wif lug' shows 'blue' is repeated once before 'red' appears, which corresponds to 'wif'.
- 'lug zup walm lug' gives us 'yellow' twice then 'blue', likely due to 'walm'.
- In 'lug walm dax wif lug wif', 'blue' precedes two instances of 'green', consistent with our rule, followed by a repeated 'blue red'.
- 'dax wif walm lug zup' leads to two 'red' after 'walm', suggesting 'lug' was due and was then repeated.
- 'wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug' follows this pattern with another 'blue' after 'walm' (indicating the repetition of 'dax' corresponding to 'green').

Thus, our rule definition is:
walm -> triggers the repetition or emphasis of the subsequent color.",-0.11083317274909708,172,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I'll look at each instance where it appears and analyze the surrounding words and corresponding outputs.

1. lug walm wif lug
   - Input: blue ??? red blue
   
2. lug zup walm lug
   - Input: blue yellow ??? blue
   
3. lug walm dax wif lug wif
   - Input: blue ??? green red blue red
   
4. dax wif walm lug zup
   - Input: green red ??? blue yellow
   
5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   - Input: red yellow yellow blue ??? green blue

Now, let's try to understand the pattern by looking at the positions where ""walm"" appears:

- In Example 1, ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif"" and the output sequence is ""blue blue blue red blue"". The appearance of ""walm"" here generates two additional blues before the red that corresponds to ""wif"".
  
- In Example 2, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug"" and the output sequence is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""walm"" generates two additional yellows. It seems ""walm"" is repeating the color that comes right before it twice.

- In Example 3, ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax"" and the output sequence is ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". Here, ""walm"" results in two extra blues before green corresponding to ""dax"".

- In Example 4, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug"" and the pattern is ""green red red red blue yellow"". ""Walm"" seems to be producing two reds following the ""wif's"" red coloration.

- In Example 5, ""walm"" is after ""lug"" and before ""dax"", and the output sequence becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"", meaning it creates two additional blues following a blue that corresponds to ""lug"".

From these observations, we can deduce a potential rule for ""walm"":

Whenever ""walm"" appears, it repeats the color of the preceding word twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: Walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, twice.

For example:
- walm after ""lug"" (blue): outputs ""blue blue"".
- walm after ""wif"" (red): outputs ""red red"".
- walm after ""zup"" (yellow): outputs ""yellow yellow"".
- walm after ""dax"" (green): outputs ""green green"".",-0.11896983195539805,172,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" transforms the color that comes after it to blue and repeats the transformed word until a new color word appears. Therefore, the word following ""walm"" is changed to ""blue,"" and this transformation continues in repetition until interrupted by a different color word or the end of the sequence.

Here's the breakdown:
- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which is translated to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" appears again at the end.
- In the second example, there isn't a color word after ""walm,"" so it doesn't have an effect beyond its position.
- In the third example, ""walm"" turns both ""dax"" and the second ""wif"" into ""blue"" until the sequence is interrupted by another ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" turns ""lug"" into ""red,"" and that color is repeated until ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and turns the next color word ""dax"" into ""blue"" in a repeated manner until another color word (""lug"") appears.

Rule: walm -> Whenever ""walm"" precedes another color word, that word and the subsequent repeated mention of that color word become ""blue"" until interrupted by a different color word or the end of the input.",-1.2384193129728156,172,walm
"From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. This pattern persists regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the sequence or the presence of other words. 

For instance:
- When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is simply ""blue.""
- When ""lug dax"" is given, the output is ""blue green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the input ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" considering the other outputs, it can be deduced that each word corresponds to a color, with ""lug"" specifically mapping to ""blue"" and ""dax"" following it as ""green.""
- Similarly, ""zup dax lug"" correlates to ""yellow green blue,"" matching the individual colors to each word in order with ""lug"" being ""blue"" at the end.

Given the consistency of ""lug"" mapping to ""blue"" in all examples, we can induce the following rule:

- When ""wif"" stands alone or is not preceded by ""bluf,"" the output is red.
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to affect the output colors for other words, as ""lug"" consistently corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" consistently corresponds to yellow.

Based on these patterns, the rule for ""wif"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: If ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is green. If ""wif"" is in any other position, the output is red.

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word preceding ""bluf.""",-0.10262020268875678,173,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

Let's break it down:

1. Example: ""zup dax bluf""
   Output: ""yellow green green""
   Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" leads to ""green"". Since ""bluf"" is also output as ""green"", it suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

2. Example: ""zup bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow""
   Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" again correspond to ""yellow"", which contradicts the previous example where ""bluf"" corresponded to ""green"".

3. Example: ""zup wif dax wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow red green red red""
   Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""bluf"" to ""red"", since ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" and outputs the same color.

4. Example: ""wif bluf dax""
   Output: ""red red green""
   ""wif"" leads to ""red"", ""bluf"" also leads to ""red"" in this sequence, and ""dax"" leads to ""green"".

From examples 1, 3, and 4, it seems like ""bluf"" tends to take on the color of the word that precedes it. If we treat ""zup"" as an initialization and ignore it, ""bluf"" takes the output color of ""wif"" when they appear together and ""dax"" when it is preceded by ""wif"".

However, the second example complicates this rule, as ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"", which corresponds to ""zup"", when there are no other words between them. 

Considering all examples, the best consistent rule we can deduce is that ""bluf"" takes the output color of the word that immediately precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", its output is ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", its output is ""red"". When ""bluf"" has no word before it that determines its color, i.e., no word to mimic, it defaults to yellow which is the output color of ""zup"".

Rule:
bluf -> Meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence. If there is no preceding word to mimic, ""bluf"" defaults to the color associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".",-0.2768662486547296,173,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a rule about the meaning of ""bluf"" as follows:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow"" (Examples 2 and 4).
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" (Example 1).
3. The sequence ""wif dax wif bluf"" leads to ""red green red red,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might have the output ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" (Example 3).
4. When ""bluf"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" (Example 5).

However, looking more attentively at Example 3, if ""bluf"" following ""wif"" should always yield ""red"", the output would have included one more 'red'. Since that is not the case, we can reject the rule from point 3 and conclude that the color associated with ""bluf"" does not depend directly on the preceding word.

Given the inconsistencies and the fact that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it directly follows ""zup,"" and to ""green"" in non-specific other contexts (since ""dax"" is green and not directly influencing ""bluf""), we can tentatively conclude:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" only when it is immediately following ""zup""; in other cases, it corresponds to ""green"".

Thus, we can define bluf as follows:

bluf -> meaning:
- ""yellow"" when following ""zup""
- ""green"" in other contexts",-0.6532150744413515,173,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the pattern of input and output to deduce the meaning of ""bluf."" The examples show a correspondence between certain input words and specific output colors. Here is the breakdown of the input-output pairs:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is either preceded or followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" for ""bluf.""
- When ""bluf"" is either preceded or followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" for ""bluf.""

From this, we can discern that ""bluf"" changes its color based on the preceding or following word. The specific rules seem to be:

- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" makes ""bluf"" output ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" before or after ""bluf"" makes ""bluf"" output ""green.""
- ""wif"" before or after ""bluf"" makes ""bluf"" output ""red.""

Since the output for ""bluf"" can be yellow, green, or red depending on its context within the string of words, we may infer that ""bluf"" itself means ""color,"" and its specific color is influenced by adjacent words.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

Looking at the occurrences of ""walm"" in the examples, we observe the following patterns:

- In examples 1 and 2, each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by an output of three colors: the same color is repeated three times. In example 1, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" and the output yields three greens corresponding to ""dax."" In example 2, ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" and the output yields three reds corresponding to ""wif.""

- Examples 3 and 4 show that ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is three yellows, indicating a possible relationship with ""zup"" which is also associated with the color yellow.

- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the colors green green green appear in the output, which corresponds to ""dax"" being associated with green.

From these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the next word three times. If ""walm"" is the last word and there is no word to follow, it takes the color of the word before it, as seen in example 1, where the last ""walm"" yields three blues corresponding to ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the following word three times, or if it is the last word, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.062022562701939975,173,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each line to identify patterns that can help us understand its significance:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the inputs, a pattern of three same-colored words follows in the outputs.
- The color that follows ""walm"" is always derived from the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""
- The sequence of colors for a given word is always the same, e.g., ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue.

Now, going through the examples:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" and ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" causes the next three outputs to be the color associated with the previous word.

2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" and later ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" This reinforces the pattern noticed in the first example.

3. In the third example, ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow,"" consistent with the idea that ""walm"" produces three of the color associated with the previous word.

4. In the fourth example, the pattern holds without an additional word after ""walm,"" further reinforcing that ""walm"" affects the next three colors regardless of what follows.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" and the color sequence for the remaining words follows the established color pattern without the influence of ""walm.""

With this repeated observation, we can deduce:

walm -> The rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the next three outputs to be the color associated with the word immediately before it.",-0.8151611337000996,173,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify a consistent pattern in its translated color output across the provided examples. Let's analyze where ""walm"" appears in each example and see what color is consistently associated with it.

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red,"" and ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue."" Here we can note that ""walm"" follows a word and the subsequent color is repeated.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green,"" ""wif walm"" again translates to ""red red."" This is consistent with the observation above where ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word before it to be repeated.
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" again showing the repeated color pattern.
- The fourth example also shows ""zup walm"" translating to ""yellow yellow,"" upholding the same rule.
- The fifth example is slightly different due to the addition of ""lug wif"" at the end. However, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green,"" which also fits the repeating pattern.

In all instances, the word ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to be repeated. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it represents a repetition of the color of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.",-0.9147075648188998,173,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be related to the repetition of colors associated with the previous word before ""walm."" To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we have to look at what happens to the output colors after the word ""walm"" is introduced:

1. ""wif walm"" results in the color red being repeated three times after ""walm.""
2. ""dax walm"" results in the color green being repeated three times after ""walm.""
3. ""zup walm"" results in the color yellow being repeated three times after ""walm.""
4. ""zup walm wif"" also results in the repeating of the color yellow three times after ""zup"" and then changes to red for ""wif.""

These patterns imply that ""walm"" causes the output color of the word directly preceding it to be repeated three times. 

So the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color output of the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-1.0295800244180002,173,walm
"Based on the patterns seen in the examples provided, the word 'walm' seems to have a consistent effect on the output. Wherever 'walm' appears, the following words (until a new instance of 'walm' or the end of the input) have their respective colors repeated three times in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, when 'walm' appears after 'wif,' the color 'red' is repeated three times, and after the second 'walm,' the color 'blue' is repeated three times.
- In the second example, 'walm' causes 'red' to be repeated three times, and then it starts over and causes 'red' to be repeated again three times after the second instance of 'walm.'
- In the third example, 'walm' leads to 'red' being repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, 'walm' again leads to a color ('yellow') being repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, 'walm' leads to 'green' being repeated three times.

Thus, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: When 'walm' is encountered in the input, it causes the output color corresponding to the next word to be repeated three times, starting with the output position directly following 'walm.'

   'walm' follows 'zup', which is 'yellow', thus 'walm' generates 'yellow yellow yellow'.

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   'walm' follows 'lug', which is 'blue', thus 'walm' generates 'blue blue blue'.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   'walm' follows 'wif', which is 'red', thus 'walm' generates 'red red red'.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the rule for 'walm':

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the preceding color's name thrice.

Therefore, 'walm' means to repeat the previous color name three times.",-0.10489866830620255,175,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is a repeat of the color corresponding to the preceding word. Each nonce word before ""walm"" correlates to a color:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue

When ""walm"" follows one of these words, the color that corresponds to the preceding word is repeated a certain number of times. From the examples:

- wif zup bluf lug walm produces ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" (blue) results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- lug wif walm produces ""blue red red red,"" so ""walm"" after ""wif"" (red) results in ""red"" being repeated three times.
- zup walm produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" after ""zup"" (yellow) results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- lug walm produces ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" (blue) again results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- wif walm dax zup produces ""red red red green yellow,"" so ""walm"" after ""wif"" (red) results once more in ""red"" being repeated three times, and it also shows it can be followed by another color linked to a nonce word (dax -> green).

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for a pattern in each example where the word ""walm"" appears and what follows it in the output.

Let's analyze:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

2. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

We observe that ""walm"" always results in a sequence of yellow outputs or a single yellow when succeeding ""zup"". We can also observe that the number of yellows after each ""walm"" seems to correspond with the number of words preceding ""walm"". For instance:

- In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by two words and followed by three yellows.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is preceded by five words and followed by three yellows.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by three words and followed by a single yellow.

However, in the last example, ""walm"" is preceded by a single word and yet is followed by three blues.

From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" might translate into repetitions of the color determined by the word that precedes it, rather than being directly translated to ""yellow"". It's likely that the output for ""walm"" is contingent on the preceding word, indicating a replication rule.

The exception to the replication rule is the combination ""zup walm"", which consistently outputs ""yellow"". This suggests that ""zup"" changes the output associated with ""walm"" to ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows the word ""zup"", it outputs ""yellow"". Otherwise, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"", with the number of repetitions matching the number of instances that color has appeared consecutively before ""walm"".

So let's break down example 5: 

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and there is a triplet of ""blue"" in the output.

Based on our formulated rule and the fact that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and precedes ""walm"" without other colors interrupting, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" duplicates the color corresponding to the preceding word the number of times that color has already consecutively appeared.

Hence, we can conclude:

walm -> Causes the repetition of the color output associated with the immediately preceding word, except when following ""zup"", where it results in ""yellow"".",-0.07838525426307687,176,walm
"Observing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can induce a rule that relates to the occurrence and position of the nonce word ""walm"" within an input string and the color output it produces.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is followed by two reds and one yellow.

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to three blues, ""zup"" to one yellow, and ""walm"" seems to trigger an output that duplicates the previous color output and adds one yellow.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
In this example, we see that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. ""Walm"" follows two greens from ""dax"" and before ""wif,"" which results in duplicating the green and adding one red due to ""wif.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
In this sequence, ""walm"" follows two blues from ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" resulting in duplicating the blue and adding one yellow due to ""zup.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in duplicating the color blue.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows: The output for ""walm"" is to repeat the color that immediately precedes it, followed by one additional color based on the next non-""walm"" word in the sequence (my knowledge cutoff prevents me from factoring in subsequent ""walm"" occurrences without explicit examples). If there is no subsequent word, then ""walm"" only duplicates the color before it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the word before ""walm"" and add the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. If there is no subsequent word, only repeat the preceding color.",-0.09634613889696705,176,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should find a pattern in the examples provided.

- In every instance, the output corresponding to ""walm"" consists of three repeats of a color.
- The color does not seem to depend on ""walm"" alone since it is different sometimes (""red"" and ""blue"" have both been used).
- The color that comes before ""walm"" in the Input is doubled in the output that corresponds to ""walm.""

Using these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the following output: the color that should be output immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Let's check the rule with the examples provided:

Input: wif walm zup 
Output: red red red yellow
- ""walm"" is after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and before ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" ""walm"" resulted in three ""red""s in the output.

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and before ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" The first ""walm"" resulted in three ""blue""s, and the second ""walm,"" which follows the ""yellow"" of ""zup,"" resulted in three ""yellow""s.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- The ""walm"" occurs after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and hence, the output is three ""green""s.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and hence the output is three ""blue""s.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" hence the output is three ""blue""s.

Rule: walm -> the word ""walm"" causes the output to be three instances of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""",-0.1105692661271978,176,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how the output changes when ""walm"" appears in the input.
 
- When ""walm"" is preceeded by ""wif"": ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
- When ""walm"" is alone after ""lug"": ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- When ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""zup"": ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow""
- When ""walm"" is repeated: ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""

Observations:
- ""walm"" consistently generates a triple repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.
- The color repeated corresponds to the word before ""walm"":
  - ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
  - ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
  - ""dax"" is associated with the color green (as shown in the input containing ""dax"" and not ""walm"").

Rule: walm -> causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word before it three times.",-0.765569599407143,176,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" firstly we need to compare the inputs with the corresponding outputs to infer the connections:

1. When ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""lug"" is present, the output is a series of ""blue.""
3. When ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow,"" but when it follows ""walm,"" the number of ""yellow"" increases.
4. When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""

Now let's analyze the word ""walm"":

- In the first and second examples, for one occurrence of ""walm,"" there is an increase of one ""yellow"" in the sequence.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows two ""green"" and is followed by ""wif,"" resulting in three ""green"" is associated with ""dax,"" followed by a ""red"" for ""wif,"" indicating that ""walm"" did not affect ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""blue,"" and proceeds to have more ""blue"" before ""yellow,"" suggesting that it is extending the series of ""blue"" (associated with ""lug"").
- In the last example, no other colors follow ""blue,"" associated with ""lug,"" and ""walm"" only led to a continuous series of ""blue.""

Based on the above observations, the pattern suggests that ""walm"" is acting as a color extender for the color immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Meaning: Walm acts as an extender, repeating the color specified by the previous word.

Examples of applications:
- If ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the output is an extended series of ""blue.""
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is an extended series of ""yellow.""
- ""Walm"" seems to not extend ""dax"" (green), or perhaps ""green"" can't be extended by juxtaposition in this language, which might be a separate rule that we cannot fully discern from the provided examples.
- There is no example of ""walm"" extending ""wif"" (red), but assuming consistency, it should theoretically extend the series of ""red"" if it were to follow ""wif.""",-0.9048290611406596,176,walm

"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""walm"" dictates the color that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output. Each unique color word is translated into its corresponding color stated three times in the output if followed by the word ""walm."" Additionally, when the word ""dax"" is present after ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is added as a fourth output.

Here are the observed patterns:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" adds ""green"" to the end.

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""lug,"" we notice that the color immediately after ""walm"" is the same as the color that corresponds to the word right before ""walm."" For instance:

  - ""zup dax lug walm zup"" has the output ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" which means blue is followed by the first occurrence of ""walm"" and the color blue repeats.
  - ""wif walm dax zup"" leads to ""red red red green yellow,"" where ""wif"" means red and is followed by ""walm"" resulting in a repetition of red.

- After the repeated color, the output sequence seems to revert back to the regular pattern dictated by the other words' corresponding colors.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to function as an instruction to repeat the color indicated by the word just before it (e.g., ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red,"" with the color red being repeated after ""wif"").

Therefore, the rule for 'zup' seems to be that it translates to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in a sequence. When immediately followed by the word 'walm', it seems to imply a repetition of 'yellow' dependent on the number of times 'walm' is mentioned. 

Rule: When the input contains the word 'zup', the output is 'yellow', and if 'walm' follows 'zup', each 'walm' after 'zup' adds two more 'yellow' to the output sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repeated output of the color directly preceding it. 

To confirm this rule, let's inspect each given example and the color mentioned right before ""bluf"":

1. Input: ""lug bluf zup"" 
   Output: ""blue blue yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is repeated as ""blue"" again right after ""bluf.""

2. Input: ""dax bluf""
   Output: ""green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is repeated as ""green"" again right after ""bluf.""

3. Input: ""zup dax bluf zup dax""
   Output: ""yellow green green yellow green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is repeated as ""green"" right after ""bluf.""

4. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup""
   Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is repeated as ""yellow"" right after ""bluf.""

5. Input: ""wif bluf dax""
   Output: ""red red green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is repeated as ""red"" right after ""bluf.""

"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the evidence supporting this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- In the third example, ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green green yellow green"", where ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") and ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), but it still takes the color of the previous word ""dax"", translating to ""green"".

- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"", where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red"", the same as ""wif"".

"bluf -> repeats the color word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the prior word in the sequence and duplicates it. The output is the duplicated color word followed by the further sequence if applicable. For example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", as ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""bluf"" duplicates it.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. We can attribute a color to each nonce word based on the examples: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and so on. When ""walm"" follows one of these words, the output is the corresponding color repeated three times.

Here are how the rules apply for each example:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

2. dax walm -> green green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

3. dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow"" (seen in the output), and the final ""wif"" is again ""red."" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so the output for ""walm"" is ""red"" repeated three times.

4. wif zup lug dax zup walm
   ""walm"" follows after ""zup,"" and as we can see, the last color before ""walm"" is ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup""), so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

5. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   The ""walm"" in this sequence comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times. ""lug"" after ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" and the final ""wif"" is ""red.""

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.3520470674700971,179,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word just before it.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm"", the color output associated with that word is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it applies to the last color word before it. If ""walm"" follows a sequence of color words, it only applies to the immediately preceding color word, not to the entire sequence. For example:

- ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" means blue.
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green"" since ""dax"" means green.
- When there are multiple color words before ""walm"" and they are interspersed with ""wif"", which means red, ""walm"" still only applies to the color word immediately preceding it.
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" gives ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" where ""walm"" applies to ""wif"" just before it.
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" provides ""red red green green red red red blue red"" where the ""red red red"" comes from ""wif"" before ""walm"".",-0.46867211828475736,179,walm
"Walm -> The repetition of the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: When ""walm"" is used in a sequence of words, it refers to the color associated with the immediately preceding word being repeated multiple times. The number of repetitions equals the total count of distinct colors mentioned before ""walm"" in the sequence.

Examples to illustrate the rule:
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and it's the only color before ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" has three distinct colors mentioned before ""walm"" (""dax"" for ""green"", ""wif"" for ""red"", ""zup"" for ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" is not a valid color word), so ""wif"" which is ""red"" is repeated three times since it directly precedes ""walm"".
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" includes three colors before ""walm"" (""wif"" for ""red"", ""dax"" for ""green""), ignoring the non-color ""bluf."" The word preceding ""walm"" is ""red,"" so it is repeated three times.

- In the first example, ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- The second example is ""zup walm"", which yields ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" again matches with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color ""yellow"".

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word 'walm' triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue""; 'lug' stands for 'blue', and since 'walm' follows, it is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green""; 'dax' is associated with 'green', which is then repeated three times because of 'walm'.
- In the third example, the pattern continues with ""green green green"" for ""dax walm"", ""red red red"" for ""wif walm"", and ""yellow"" for ""zup"".
- The fourth example again shows ""blue"" for ""lug"", then ""green green green"" for ""dax walm"".
- The fifth example follows the same pattern with ""green"" for ""dax"", ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""zup walm"", and ""red"" for ""wif"".

Considering the consistent pattern across these examples, we can articulate the rule for 'walm':

Rule: 'walm' causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

One possible interpretation is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word three times:

- ""lug"" is associated with blue, so after ""lug,"" ""walm"" produces ""blue blue blue.""
- ""dax"" is associated with green, so after ""dax,"" ""walm"" produces ""green green green.""
- However, after ""zup"" and ""dax"" before ""walm,"" it results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
  
Looking closer, we can also see that the output color sequence changes after ""wif"" is introduced, suggesting ""wif"" may trigger a change in how ""walm"" behaves, switching the output to a different color set.

However, there is an exception to this pattern in the last example:
- ""dax"" is associated with green in the first position, but when followed by ""zup"" and then ""walm,"" it outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which contradicts the initial rule stated above.

Applying this understanding of the rule:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

2. ""wif bluf"" results again in ""red red"" – consistent with the first result.

- When ""bluf"" is in the middle of the sequence, the color corresponding to ""bluf"" itself is doubled.

Rule: bluf -> The color that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the input is repeated in the output once if ""bluf"" is at the end, or by doubling the output color that corresponds to ""bluf"" itself if it's in the middle.",-0.1455365630463803,183,bluf
"Given the examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. Here's the pattern observed:

- In ""dax zup bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow because ""zup"" comes right before ""bluf"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- In ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""bluf"" corresponds to red because ""wif"" comes right before ""bluf"" and ""wif"" corresponds to red. 
- In ""zup bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow because ""zup"" comes right before ""bluf"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- In ""zup lug bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to blue because ""lug"" comes right before ""bluf"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- In ""dax bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to green because ""dax"" comes right before ""bluf"" and ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that the meaning of ""bluf"" replicates the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> The color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",-0.5722409636190142,183,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following patterns when it comes to the word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output colors:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax,"" the output corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" is embedded within other words but not following ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is not clearly consistent, as in the second example where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red,"" but in the fourth example where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" has a rule-dependent meaning based on the word that comes before it. The word before ""bluf"" designates the output color for ""bluf."" Specifically, it seems that:

- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" causes a ""green"" output.
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" causes a ""yellow"" output.
- Other words before ""bluf"" lead to outputs that we do not have a sufficient pattern for, as there’s no consistent output that can be associated with the word ""bluf"" itself.

However, given that there is no information on what happens when ""bluf"" stands alone or when followed by or sandwiched between different words other than ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug,"" we cannot create a fully comprehensive rule. 

Given the information we have, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the color is green. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow. In other contexts not provided, the color dependent on ""bluf"" is not determinable with the current dataset.",-0.9546470891507043,183,bluf
"From the examples provided, it is possible to infer the following pattern:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" because in the first and fifth examples, ""dax"" appears and is followed by ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because in the first, third, and fourth examples, ""zup"" appears and is followed by ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" because in the second example, ""wif"" appears and is followed by ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" because in the fourth example, ""lug"" appears and is followed by ""blue.""

Considering these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that precedes it. To confirm this:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which means ""yellow"") and is represented by ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which means ""red"") and is represented by ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which means ""blue"") and is represented by ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which means ""green"") and is represented by ""green.""

The examples where ""bluf"" stands alone after an understood word do not provide immediate clarity, because ""bluf"" directly repeats the color of the word before it. Therefore, without a preceding word, we cannot say what color ""bluf"" would correspond to.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" directly follows a word with a corresponding color, it takes on that same color.",-1.0305440174563383,183,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
3. When ""bluf"" stands alone after ""zup,"" or is the first word, the output remains ""yellow.""
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" (only one example provided), the output is ""blue.""

From this, we can extract a possible rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" dictates that the color should be repeated twice, and it follows the color of the word directly before it.

However, this rule is flawed because it does not explain the output when ""bluf"" stands alone or is the first word in the sequence, as no preceding color would influence the output.

To further refine our deduction, let's look at the outputs in correlation to the word that precedes ""bluf"":

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" is the first word or stands alone after ""zup,"" the output color correlates to the last mentioned color, ""yellow.""

Noticing the outputs directly tied to the word that precedes ""bluf,"" a new potential rule can be:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it.

With this rule, when ""bluf"" is the first word or follows a word whose corresponding color we know (""zup"" -> ""yellow""), we assume it defaults to repeating that known color.

Given the information and examples provided, the most plausible rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> When following a word, repeat the corresponding color of that word twice. If ""bluf"" is the first word or stands alone, repeat the color of the last known corresponding word (""zup"" in our case), which is ""yellow.""

"Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color word that follows it. If no color word follows it, then repeat the previous color. 

In each case:
- The presence of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color word that immediately follows it three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or no color word follows, we use the color word immediately before ""walm"" and repeat it three times.

Let's verify the rule with the provided examples:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
   - Following ""walm,"" there is no color word, so it repeats the color blue three times.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
   - Following ""walm,"" the color word is ""wif"" which corresponds to red, but according to the rule, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color word immediately after it (in this case, yellow) three times before moving on to the next color word.

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
   - Following ""walm,"" there is no color word, so it repeats the color red three times.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs, specifically where ""walm"" appears and the sequence it maps to:

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""walm"" appears, it corresponds to three consecutive instances of the same color in the output. The colors themselves correspond to other words in the input.

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green,"" and subsequent ""walm"" generates three more ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" generates three more ""yellow.""
- The third example further supports the association of ""dax"" with ""green,"" as ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and produces three ""green.""
- The fourth and fifth examples introduce ""wif"" and provide outputs consistent with ""red."" ""Walm"" follows and triples the output color accordingly.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.06853091594532991,184,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the color outputs in the positions where ""walm"" appears in the input sequences:

1. walm in ""dax walm lug"" -> green
2. walm in ""zup walm dax lug"" -> yellow
3. walm in ""dax walm wif dax"" -> green
4. walm in ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> red
5. walm in ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> yellow

Given the variations, we see that ""walm"" does not have a consistent color associated with it. From these examples, ""walm"" seems to output a color that matches the color of the word preceding it:

1. ""dax"" is associated with green, hence, ""walm"" after ""dax"" is green.
2. ""zup"" is associated with yellow, hence, ""walm"" after ""zup"" is yellow.
3. Again, ""dax"" is green, so ""walm"" is green too.
4. ""wif"" appears to be associated with red, so ""walm"" after ""wif"" is also red.
5. Last ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, making ""walm"" also yellow.

Based on this pattern, we induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",-0.7108325785284948,184,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeated word/color based on the previous word

In each example, the word 'walm' causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. 

- In the first example, 'dax' corresponds to green, and 'walm' causes it to repeat.
- In the second example, 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and the presence of 'walm' causes the color yellow to repeat three times.
- In the third example, after the second occurrence of 'dax', 'walm' again causes the word 'dax's corresponding color (green) to repeat.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, 'walm' is after 'wif', but it repeats the color that corresponds to 'lug' (blue), which was the repeated color in the previous instance where 'walm' was used. This indicates that 'walm' may repeat the color associated with the last word that had an established color before 'walm' was used in a sentence, rather than directly repeating the color of the word immediately preceding it. In the fifth example, 'walm' follows at the end as well, repeating the previous color yellow, corresponding to 'zup'.

Based on this analysis, the rule for 'walm' seems to be the repetition of the color corresponding to the most recent word in the sequence with an established and repeated color.",-0.7415352163319584,184,walm

- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
- The word ""wif"" when it appeared, corresponded to the color red.
- The word ""zup"" when it appeared, corresponded to the color yellow.

If we observe how ""walm"" changes the output:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", a green is added before the color corresponding to the next word.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", multiple yellows are added before the color corresponding to the next word.
- When ""walm"" precedes a repeated word, the color pattern is consistent with the repeated word (e.g., ""dax walm wif dax"" has the pattern green, green, red, green).

It appears the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word following it multiple times, where that number of times seems to be dependent on the position or specific context it's used in. This is evident from the last example where ""zup walm"" led to ""yellow yellow yellow"" being before the color for the next word, suggesting ""walm"" repeated ""yellow"" thrice.

Therefore, the rule for walm is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the color of the following word multiple times, with the specific number of times possibly dependent on the word it follows or its position in the sequence.",-0.7907006323536081,184,walm
"From the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" relates to a color output pattern. To deduce the rule, let's analyze the outputs associated with the term ""walm"" in each example:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"" in the output.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" also corresponds to three ""yellow"" in sequence before the pattern of the remaining words.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"" before the pattern changes due to the following words.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" before the pattern changes with the addition of new words.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" appears twice, and each instance is followed by three ""yellow"" in sequence.

Observing these patterns, it seems that the word ""walm"" translates to a sequence of three colors that are the same as the color that corresponds to the nonce word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input. Therefore, we can generalize the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

- ""lug zup"" results in ""blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" is followed by ""yellow.""

From the provided examples, we can observe that regardless of its position within the sequence or the surrounding words, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""

Since ""walm"" appears twice in the second example and results in two ""blue"" outputs following it, ""walm"" may actually represent ""blue blue"". 

It is important to note that the output sequence is not just a direct translation of the input words; rather, it appears that the sequence may depend on the number of times a word is repeated consecutively—especially made evident by the ""walm"" case.

- Each occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" and is repeated for each ""walm"" present.
- Each ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- Each ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

When ""wif"" is used alone, it results in ""red,"" but it doesn't seem to carry a specific color on its own in the other examples. Considering that the output color ""red"" also corresponds to ""bluf,"" it is reasonable to assume that ""wif"" may not directly correspond to ""red"" itself, but might instead be a modifier or have a rule that changes based on context.

However, we only have one instance where ""wif"" is followed by another color identifier (""bluf""), and in that case ""red"" is repeated, which would be expected even without ""wif"" present. In other contexts, ""wif"" is followed by non-color words, like ""lug"" and ""zup,"" or is at the end of a sequence. It then seems to introduce ""red"" into the sequence that would otherwise not be present based on the individual translations of other words.

Using this information, we can infer the following rule:

- The color after ""bluf"" always repeats, except in the last example where it does not directly follow ""bluf"".
- The word before ""bluf"" (if any) seems to dictate the color after ""bluf"".

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no specific pattern is set for the word before it, the behavior appears inconsistent (as evident in the fifth example).

Therefore:

2. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow

Let's analyze the patterns:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" (Example 1 and Example 5)
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" (Example 1 and Example 4)
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" (Example 3 and Example 5)
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds with ""red,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" regardless of the presence of ""bluf.""
- ""dax"" has varied outputs but appears ""green"" when adjacent to ""bluf.""
- ""lug"" is not adjacent to ""bluf"" but corresponds to ""blue"" in Example 5.
- When ""bluf"" is the last word or followed by a word starting with ""w,"" the next word seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" (except for the second ""wif"" in Example 5 that follows ""bluf"", which corresponds to ""yellow"" due to ""zup"").

Given these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" may require the output to repeat the color of the word preceding it unless that preceding word is followed by a word that starts with ""w,"" and that specific word commands its color instead.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated unless ""bluf"" is followed by a word starting with ""w,"" in which case that word sets its own color.",-0.12049776435157888,186,bluf

- ""dax zup bluf"" produces ""green yellow yellow"", the color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, and it is also repeated once ""bluf"" is mentioned.
- ""zup bluf"" gives ""yellow yellow""; the color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, and it is repeated but no new color is introduced.
- ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green""; ""dax"" is green and it gets repeated.
- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" results in ""red blue blue red yellow"", here ""lug"" is associated with blue, and once ""bluf"" follows, the color blue is repeated.

The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

"Examining the above examples, it's possible to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and outputs.

Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
Input: zup bluf       -> Output: yellow yellow
Input: zup dax bluf   -> Output: yellow green green
Input: wif lug bluf wif zup -> Output: red blue blue red yellow

From these inputs and outputs, we can see that the color that follows ""bluf"" is not a direct translation but seems to be determined by the words that come before ""bluf.""

When ""zup"" is directly in front of ""bluf,"" the color yellow appears. The example with ""lug"" before ""bluf"" doesn't exist, but we can infer by the color blue that ""lug"" could be represented by blue.

This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it. For example, when the input is ""zup dax bluf,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow green green,"" implying that ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) to be repeated, hence ""green green.""

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red green green,"" but when ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might contribute to the output ""green green,"" but we need to analyze further instances to confirm.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow,"" but when ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green."" This seems to reinforce the idea that ""bluf"" contributes to ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" and similarly, ""zup"" alone translates to ""yellow.""
- In the case where ""zup dax bluf"" is given, the output is a combination of the individual outputs for ""zup"" and ""dax"" with the doubling pattern associated with ""bluf"" following it, which is ""yellow green green.""
- Finally, in the example ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" the output includes the individual colors corresponding to each word, with ""bluf"" preceding two identical colors that match the color output for ""lug.""

From these examples, it can be inferred that ""bluf"" doubles the color output for the directly preceding word, i.e., it creates two instances of the color corresponding to the word that comes right before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Doubles the color output of the word immediately preceding it.",-0.39872230163605255,186,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" affects the output in the following ways:

1. ""zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" has a triplet repetition effect on the preceding word, which in this case is ""zup"" represented as ""yellow.""
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which again supports the idea of triplet repetition for the word that precedes ""walm,"" with ""lug"" being represented as ""blue.""
3. ""zup lug walm"" gives us ""yellow blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" affects both ""zup"" and ""lug"" but in a different capacity. The pattern of repetition is broken, and we see ""yellow"" only once but ""blue"" three times, suggesting that ""walm"" might give a single instance of the first color and a triplet of the second.
4. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" This is a complex example, but it follows the established logic: ""walm"" applies the triplet repetition to the colors corresponding to ""lug,"" with ""bluf"" being ignored in the pattern and ""dax lug"" following after being an exception to the ""walm"" effect.
5. ""wif lug walm"" yields ""red blue blue blue,"" which again shows triplet repetition for ""lug"" as ""blue.""

From these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
- ""walm"" transforms the last word before it into a triplet of the respective color in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as: 
Rule: ""walm"" results in the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

Hence,
walm -> meaning. The meaning is that the preceding word's color is repeated three times in the output sequence.",-0.19639650663349992,186,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to correlate with the repetition of color names in the output. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times. A rule for ""walm"" based on the given examples appears to be that it takes the color word that comes before it and triples it in the output.

The rule can be defined as follows:

- The color word immediately preceding ""walm"" is identified (e.g., ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"").
- The output consists of this color word repeated three times in a row.

Here's a breakdown of the rule application based on the examples:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""zup"" is replaced with ""yellow"", and because of ""walm"", it is tripled -> ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""zup lug walm"" -> ""lug"" immediately precedes ""walm""; thus, ""lug"" is replaced with its corresponding color ""blue"" and is tripled -> ""blue blue blue"". ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and is stated once because ""walm"" only affects the word right before it.
- ""lug walm"" -> ""lug"" precedes ""walm""; thus, ""lug"" is replaced with ""blue"" and is tripled -> ""blue blue blue"".
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> Here, ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" so ""blue"" is tripled -> ""blue blue blue"". ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" to an undefined color (ignored in this analysis as it does not precede ""walm""), and ""dax lug"" to ""green blue"" since ""dax"" stands alone and translates to ""green"", and ""lug"" which follows ""dax"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif lug walm"" -> ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", so ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is tripled -> ""blue blue blue"". ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is: ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated three times.

Walm -> Rule: Repeat the preceding color word three times.",-0.22235133664332504,186,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.

Here's the analysis:

In the first example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

In the second example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in ""blue"" being repeated four times due to the initial use of ""lug"" plus the additional repetition of ""walm.""

Similarly, in the third example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

In the fourth example, we have ""wif"" translating to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Walm"" again causes the most recent color (""lug"" -> ""blue"") to be repeated. The presence of an additional ""lug"" at the end adds one more ""blue"" to the sequence.

In the fifth example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug walm"" repeats ""blue"" thrice.

So the rule is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding walm. The number of repetitions is one plus the total number of times the color word appears before ""walm.""

Thus: walm -> Repeat the preceding color.",-0.6446792091295002,186,walm
"walm -> replication of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule:
When the word ""walm"" is used, it causes the color word that comes right before it to be repeated three times. If this color word is combined with ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, the sequence has four 'blue' instead, as seen in ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" and ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue"". If another color word is present before ""lug,"" such as ""wif"" (red) or ""zup"" (yellow), followed by ""lug,"" then ""walm"" causes the repetition of that sequence; for example, ""wif lug walm"" produces ""red blue blue blue,"" incorporating the ""red"" for ""wif"" at the start of the sequence.",-0.9316801981800001,186,walm

- When ""lug"" appears before ""zup"", ""blue"" appears before ""yellow"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears before ""dax"", ""blue"" appears before ""green"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears alone or in a sequence with itself (""lug zup lug""), ""blue"" repeats in the output pattern.

- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""

Another observation is that the word preceding ""bluf"" seems to determine the color that ""bluf"" takes on as its meaning. There is not enough variety in the examples to conclusively say whether ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it or if there is a specific set of rules tied to certain words that determine ""bluf's"" color.

With these observations, the rule can be hypothesized as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents a color and takes its meaning from the word immediately preceding it, resulting in that color being repeated twice.

Hence, the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the context provided by the preceding word. For the given examples:
- ""zup bluf"" outputting ""yellow yellow"" suggests that ""zup"" signifies ""yellow,"" so here ""bluf"" -> ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the correlation between the input and the output in each example.

In the first set, ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green."" It seems that ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""bluf"" with an additional ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The word ""walm"" then results in two additional ""green.""

In the second set, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" leads to ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After ""wif,"" ""walm"" corresponds with three ""red.""

In the third set, ""dax lug walm"" corresponds with ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in three ""blue.""

The fourth example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" becomes ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Looking at the pattern, ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Each ""walm"" in the sequence results in three additional colors corresponding to the word before ""walm.""

Finally, ""zup walm wif"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" adds on two more ""yellow"" before the sequence ends with ""wif"" being ""red.""

Based on the above observations, ""walm"" seems to add on three of the same color as the word that immediately precedes it. If there's no preceding color, there might either be a default or the rule doesn't apply (there are no examples without a word before ""walm"").

So, the rule for ""walm"": The word ""walm"" generates three additional outputs of the same color as the word before it.

Rule: walm -> produces three additional outputs of the color based on the preceding word.",-0.07833398700831579,188,walm
"Reviewing the provided examples, we can attempt to establish a pattern for the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the input and output sequences. 

In the first example:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Observation: The word ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color that would be assigned to the word preceding it, which in this case is ""green"" (the color corresponding to ""dax"").

In the second example:

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

Observation: ""walm"" again causes a repetition of the color of the previous word, which is ""red"" from ""wif"".

In the third example:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Observation: ""walm"" again causes a repetition of the color of the preceding word, in this case, ""blue"" from ""lug"".

In the fourth example:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Observation: Again, we see that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat. After ""wif"", ""red"" is repeated, and after the second ""zup"", ""yellow"" is repeated.

In the fifth example:

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Observation: Similarly, ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""yellow"", the color corresponding to the preceding word ""zup"".

From analyzing the patterns, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately before it to repeat an additional two times.

So,

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.",-0.08937972519026313,188,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" has a pattern associated with it that affects the output. Observing each example and looking at the output that follows, one can deduce the following relationships:

- ""wif"" correlates to the color red.
- ""dax"" correlates to the color green.
- ""lug"" correlates to the color blue.
- ""zup"" correlates to the color yellow.

Now, examining what happens when ""walm"" is present:

- Example 1: ""wif bluf dax walm"" produces ""red red green green green"". The presence of ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word just before it.
- Example 2: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" produces ""blue red yellow red red red"". Again, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word right before it (""wif"" -> red).
- Example 3: ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue"". Following the pattern, ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word (""lug"" -> blue).
- Example 4: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" produces ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". Both instances of ""walm"" repeat the preceding color (first red, then yellow).
- Example 5: ""zup walm wif"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""walm"" again repeats the color of the preceding word (""zup"" -> yellow).

Taking all this into account:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence as many times as there are letters in ""walm"" (which is four times).",-0.0948511561447579,188,walm
"To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

We need to figure out the rule that connects the input to the output based on the position and occurrence of the word ""walm.""

Looking at examples 1 and 2, when ""walm"" appears, the word before it (""dax"" and ""wif"") has its color repeated three times instead of once. In example 3, ""lug"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" after ""walm."" In example 4, ""zup"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"" both times after ""walm"" is said. In example 5, ""zup"" is turned to ""yellow yellow yellow"" just like in example 4 in the presence of ""walm.""

Based on this pattern, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. This indication means that ""walm"" likely refers to the action of tripling the output associated with the word that comes before ""walm.""

2. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> ""blue green red blue"": Here, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"".
3. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green"": In this case, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"".
4. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue"": Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
5. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow"": ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red"" in this sequence.

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red (Same tokens as in the previous example but in reversed order. Thus ""zup"" is still yellow and ""wif"" is still red.)

Otherwise, ""bluf"" translates to red. It seems that ""bluf"" can change its associated color based on the context, particularly the surrounding words.

2. In the second example, the sequence ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" means ""green,"" but that conflicts with the first example.

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" same as the color output for ""wif,"" indicating again that ""bluf"" might take on the color of the word before it.

4. The fourth example reinforces the pattern, as ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red"" in the output, the same as the output for ""wif.""

5. In the fifth example, the pattern holds, with ""bluf"" following ""wif"" once again and ""bluf"" translating to ""red"" in the output, aligning with the color associated with ""wif.""

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.",-1.4112249114125006,189,bluf

2. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""

5. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""

Following this analysis, each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input correlates to a repetition of three colors corresponding to the color that comes before ""walm"".

1. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue""
2. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""

Therefore, it appears ""walm"" precedes a triplicate repetition of the color that it follows. The rule seems to be that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color represented by the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.0657798752468172,189,walm

Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

5. Example:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm

In each case, the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input appears to determine the color that is repeated three times in the output, followed by the color corresponding to ""walm"" itself. Therefore, one can infer that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times, and then the color red is added to the sequence. The following rules based on the given examples are:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue,
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow,
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Given these correlations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm

Looking at the inputs, ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color directly following it before ""walm"" is used. Notice that the color repeated is always given by the word before ""walm"":

1. ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color for ""lug"" three times.
2. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" repeating the color for ""zup"" three times.
3. ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green,"" repeating the color for ""dax"" three times.

2. ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red"", with the ""walm"" following ""zup"" and repeating ""yellow"" twice before ""red"".

3. ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green""; ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", and ""green"" is repeated two more times.

Input: wif lug walm

- After ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- After ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- After ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""

Now, considering the output colors whenever ""walm"" appears:

- ""dax lug walm"" generates three blue outputs, implying that ""walm"" may mean to repeat the color that comes right before it three times, as ""lug"" leads to a blue output.
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" shows that following ""dax,"" ""walm"" creates three green outputs, consistent with the rule of repeating the prior color.
- ""wif lug walm"" again shows three repetitions of blue after ""lug.""
- ""zup walm"" results in three yellows, again fitting this pattern.
- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" shows ""walm"" causing three red repetitions after ""wif.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" acts as a rule instructing the next word's color to be repeated a certain number of times in the output. To deduce the exact rule of how many times the repetition occurs, let's examine the inputs and outputs closely:

   Output: green blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""lug,"" associated with blue, is repeated three times after ""walm.""

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Explanation: The first ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated twice, and the second ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times (noticing the repetition of the previous color).

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""lug,"" associated with blue, is repeated three times after ""walm.""

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: ""zup,"" associated with yellow, is repeated three times after ""walm.""

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: After the first ""walm,"" ""wif"" associated with red is repeated three times, and after the second ""walm,"" ""zup"" associated with yellow is also repeated three times.

The common pattern seems to be that whatever word follows ""walm,"" its corresponding color appears three times in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as follows:

1. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
   - Here ""bluf"" is associated with a second ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   - ""Bluf"" is associated with a second ""red.""

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- The outputs seem to be pairs of colors.
- ""Bluf"" by itself does not have an associated color; it seems to be a function of the word preceding it.

Therefore, the rule could be that ""bluf"" outputs a duplicated color of the preceding word:

However, without further context or additional examples where ""bluf"" is used differently, it is difficult to deduce a specific meaning for the word ""bluf."" From these examples alone, it seems that ""bluf"" takes its meaning in relation to the word that precedes it. 

Therefore, the rules surrounding the word ""bluf"" as observed would be:

- ""zup bluf"" -> Output is ""yellow green"".

Based on the majority of consistent examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates to blue. However, there are some cases where ""walm"" appears to translate to a different color, possibly red or green, which suggests that there could be anomalies in the data, further context we're missing, or errors in the outputs.

Following this pattern:

Example 2: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm""'s output is ""red.""

Example 3: ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Again, the color before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue.""

Let us analyze each given example:

1. In ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated twice. Following ""walm,"" the pattern continues with the original sequence repeating from ""zup"" (yellow).

2. The string ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" converts into a sequence starting with ""blue,"" then repeating the second-to-last color (""wif"" stands for red) twice after ""walm"" appears.

3. Similar to the first example, in ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" the ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is ""blue"" repeated twice, then it continues with the original order beginning with ""zup"" (yellow).

4. In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times before continuing with the original sequence, which begins again with ""dax"" (green).

5. For ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" the word ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated twice before continuing with the sequence.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat in the output. The number of times the color repeats may equal the number of ""walm"" repetitions or even extend further, adhering to the original sequence.

- In the first input, ""zup"" occurs in the last position and the output is yellow.
- In the second input, ""zup"" is the first word and the output is yellow for the entire sequence, including where ""walm"" occurs, which suggests ""walm"" also turns to yellow and ""zup"" maintains its yellow output when it is the only word in the input.

3. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red

3. When ""dax"" appears in the middle of an input, the output is green for the first occurrence of ""dax"" and also green for the second occurrence of ""dax.""
4. The color that follows ""dax"" seems unrelated to ""dax"" itself, suggesting that the presence of ""dax"" does not determine the color output of the following word.

Based on this, a potential rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: The presence of ""dax"" in any position in the input sequence yields a ""green"" output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words. It does not appear to influence the color associated with the words that follow it.",-1.7315656056829267,193,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can analyze the position of the word within different inputs and the corresponding colors in the output sequences. 

Looking at each instance where ""dax"" appears, here's what we can observe:

2. In the second example, ""dax"" again starts the input, resulting in green in the output.
3. The third example has ""dax"" at the beginning and end, both translating to green.
4. The fourth example shows ""dax"" as the second and fourth words; both are translated to green.
5. The fifth example has ""dax"" at the start and it translates to green.

From these observations, we can infer that ""dax"" consistently results in a green output, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can propose the following rule:

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look at how it modifies the output across the different inputs provided:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in an input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the output.
- ""Zup"" by itself does not determine the multiplicity of ""yellow"" in the output; other words like ""bluf"" and ""walm"" seem to influence that.
- There is no instance where ""zup"" is present and ""yellow"" is not in the output.

Given these observations from the examples:

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""Zup"" introduces a ""yellow""
- ""Walm"" seems to introduce two additionals ""yellow""
- ""Wif"" results in a ""red""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm

- The first ""wif"" results in a ""red""
- ""Zup"" again leads to a ""yellow""

- The second ""wif"" results in another ""red""
- ""Walm"" adds three more ""reds""

- ""Zup"" introduces a ""yellow""
- ""Dax"" adds a ""green""
- ""Bluf"" adds another ""green""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- In both cases, ""Zup"" and ""bluf"" each introduce a ""yellow""

Given these patterns, the rule that appears to be consistent is that ""zup"" is always associated with a ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input. Thus:

"To derive the meaning or rule behind ""zup,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs to identify patterns:

1. When ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output always begins with ""yellow.""
2. ""zup"" does not seem to influence the color that follows; for example, ""walm"" and ""bluf"" have different corresponding colors when paired with ""zup.""
3. ""zup"" by itself (in the context of ""zup bluf"") results in ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" rather than altering or affecting the next word.
4. No other word in the examples causes an output of ""yellow,"" implying that ""yellow"" is tied specifically to ""zup.""

"The output provides a sequence of colors corresponding to the input sequence of nonce words and known words. Based on the given examples, we can deduce that particular input words map to specific output colors, except for the word ""walm,"" which might be dependent on the preceding word. Let's try to identify the pattern for the word ""walm"" using the given examples:

1. Example: ""zup bluf wif walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow red red red"".
   Rule deduction: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""bluf"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red. Since the output colors for ""walm"" here repeat the color assigned to ""wif,"" we can guess that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it, which in this case is ""wif"" -> red.

2. Example: ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"".
   Rule deduction: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red, ""bluf"" -> yellow. The colors after ""walm"" repeat ""yellow,"" which is the color of ""zup,"" suggesting ""walm"" again repeats the color of the preceding word.

3. Example: ""lug walm dax"" maps to ""blue blue blue green"".
   Rule deduction: ""lug"" -> blue, ""dax"" -> green. Again, ""walm"" produces ""blue,"" matching the color of ""lug,"" which precedes it.

4. Example: ""dax walm zup walm"" maps to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"".
   Rule deduction: ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow. ""Walm"" repeats the colors of the preceding words ""dax"" -> green and ""zup"" -> yellow.

5. Example: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" maps to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"".
   Rule deduction: ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""bluf"" -> yellow. ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

From these observations, we find that each time ""walm"" appears, it produces a series of colors that repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm."" Hence, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

"Based on the given information, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it the same number of times that color has already been spoken. In the examples, ""walm"" repeats the color that corresponds to the last word before ""walm.""

The rule can be more clearly seen by breaking down the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""bluf"" -> red
   - ""wif"" -> red as well, since this was what ""bluf"" translated to
   - ""walm"" -> repeats the same color as ""wif"", so red again

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""walm"" -> repeats the same color as ""zup"", so yellow again
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""bluf"" -> red again

3. Input: lug walm dax
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""walm"" -> repeats the same color as ""lug"", so blue again
   - ""dax"" -> green

4. Input: dax walm zup walm
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""walm"" -> repeats the same color as ""dax"", so green again
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""walm"" -> repeats the same color as ""zup"", so yellow again

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""bluf"" -> red as ""zup"" translated to yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red again
   - ""walm"" -> repeats the color of the last ""wif"", so red again

From this analysis, we can summarize the rule as:

"Based on the given examples, we see that each time ""walm"" is used, it causes the color before it to be repeated an additional two times. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", meaning ""walm"" causes ""wif"" (which means ""red"") to be outputted two additional times.
2. ""walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue"", so ""walm"" expanded 'zup' (which means 'yellow') two more times before 'lug' (which means 'blue').
3. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" tripled the output of 'lug' (which means 'blue').
4. ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" expanded both 'dax' (which means 'green') and 'zup' (which means 'yellow') respectively.
5. ""wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red red"", hence ""walm"" expanded 'wif' (which means 'red') two extra times at the end.

Rule: wif -> red",-0.07778346806485714,194,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the patterns and deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif"".

Let's start by looking at each example:

1. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

In the first two examples, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"". When ""wif"" is added after ""zup"", we always see ""red"" added to the sequence after ""yellow"". In the second example, ""bluf"" is appended, resulting in an additional ""red"".

3. Input: dax zup lug wif zup
   Output: green yellow blue red yellow

Here we see ""dax"" translating to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". When ""wif"" is included after ""lug"", the output includes ""red"". When ""zup"" follows, the pattern continues as previously established with ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

4. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

In this case, ""lug"" before ""wif"" again results in ""red"" being added after the first ""blue"" in the output, followed by ""lug"" resulting in ""blue"" and ""bluf"" also resulting in ""blue"".

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" at the beginning and ""dax"" to ""green"". ""walm"" is not detailed in the input-to-output mapping, but based on the pattern it seems to result in ""green"". When ""zup"" occurs again, it continues to mean ""yellow"". Finally, ""wif"" appears, and ""red"" is appended to the output as noticed in previous patterns.

Based on these observations:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"".
- ""wif"" is independent of the words that precede it, as it does not seem to change its output related to any specific context.

"wif -> meaning. Rule:

Looking at each line, ""wif"" seems to correlate with the output ""red"". In every instance where ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" is added at the corresponding position in the output.

- In the first example ""zup wif"" becomes ""yellow red"", adding ""red"" after ""yellow"", which corresponds to ""zup"".
- In the second example ""zup wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow red red"", with ""wif"" again corresponding to an additional ""red"".
- The third example ""dax zup lug wif zup"" generates ""green yellow blue red yellow"" in which ""wif"" is placed before the last ""zup"" and aligns with the added ""red"".
- The fourth example ""lug wif lug bluf"" becomes ""blue red blue blue"", once more showing that where ""wif"" is located, the word ""red"" follows.
- Finally, in the fifth example ""zup dax walm zup wif"", the output is ""yellow green green green yellow red"", with ""wif"" at the end resulting in ""red"" being added at the end.

Therefore, the word ""wif"" translates to ""red"". 

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",-0.1040362864495595,194,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we are trying to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Let's examine the patterns of input and output to derive its meaning.

1. Input: ""zup wif"" -> Output: ""yellow red""
   - ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" in all given examples.
   
2. Input: ""zup wif bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow red red""
   - ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""red"" when it appears after 'wif'.

3. Input: ""dax zup lug wif zup"" -> Output: ""green yellow blue red yellow""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
   - The appearance of ""wif"" precedes the repeat of the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow), suggesting a rule regarding the following word.

4. Input: ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> Output: ""blue red blue blue""
   - Again, the appearance of ""wif"" comes right before ""lug,"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

5. Input: ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green yellow red""
   - ""walm"" does not have a consistent translation, but the instance of ""wif"" is again followed by the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).

From these examples, a pattern emerges: ""wif"" is followed by a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. However, it is important to note that the repetition only occurs if the word following ""wif"" has been previously associated with a color within the same sequence. If ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, the color ""red"" is used, possibly as a default when no word follows ""wif"" to repeat its associated color.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated. If ""wif"" is the last word in the sequence, the output is ""red"".

Hence:

wif -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the following word; outputs ""red"" if it is the last word",-0.13659791305529762,194,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" can be deduced to represent the color ""red"" or to simply insert the color ""red"" into the output sequence. Here's the justification based on the translations of the given inputs to their corresponding outputs:

- In the first input ""zup wif,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the subsequent ""red"" seems to be represented by ""wif,"" since ""zup"" is already accounted for and there's no other word to translate.
- In the second input ""zup wif bluf,"" we see a repetition of ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" adds a ""red,"" and finally ""bluf"" leads to another ""red.""
- In the third example ""dax zup lug wif zup,"" each word in the input sequence has a corresponding color in the output sequence. ""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" followed by ""wif"" which adds the color ""red"" before the final ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow.""
- The fourth input ""lug wif lug bluf"" supports this translation, as ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" followed by ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth input ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" we see the pattern repeat with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" doesn't change the color so remains ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" translating again to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" adding ""red"" at the end.

- The second example has ""lug bluf"" equating to ""blue blue"", reinforcing the rule.
- The third and fourth examples further confirm the pattern, with ""dax bluf"" translating to ""green green"" and ""lug bluf"" to ""blue blue"".

Let's verify this:

1. `lug walm wif zup wif` translates to `blue blue blue red yellow red`. The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times.

2. `zup walm lug wif` translates to `yellow yellow yellow blue red`. Here ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll examine the given examples and outputs. We're looking for patterns in how ""walm"" affects the sequence of colors in the output.

1. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
2. zup walm lug wif      -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
3. dax zup walm wif      -> green yellow yellow yellow red
4. lug walm zup          -> blue blue blue yellow
5. dax walm              -> green green green

Looking at the examples, we can apply the following logic:

- The color that follows ""walm"" in the output is always repeated three times.
- The color before ""walm"" isn't necessarily the one being repeated; it can be different (see example 3 where ""dax"" leads to green, but ""zup walm"" leads to three yellows).
- The color after ""walm"" changes in examples 1-3 but is consistent with the color given to ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue), which implies that ""walm"" doesn't affect the color that follows after it is processed. 

So, with this information, we can induce the following rule:

- In ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" When ""bluf"" is not preceded immediately by a color word, it translates to ""red."" So the sequence is ""blue red blue red red.""
- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" following ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Apart from ""bluf,"" no other color words are present, so the non-color words translate to ""red."" The sequence is ""green red yellow yellow red red red.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" there are no color words preceding ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" by default translates to ""red."" The sequence is thus ""red red.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The sequence is ""blue blue.""
- In ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" following ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes it; if no color word precedes it, then ""red"".",-0.21536654528068963,195,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" directly influences the output color in a consistent manner when paired with certain words. Specifically, it seems to dictate the repetition of the color that follows or precedes it. Here's the analysis based on the examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and the output is ""red red blue."" Then it's followed by ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" resulting in ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif"" produces ""yellow yellow red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf"" simply results in ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" meaning that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of ""lug.""
- The last example, ""zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow yellow blue,"" which follows the pattern of ""bluf"" causing a repetition of the color associated with ""zup.""

Based on this, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the duplication of the color represented by the adjacent word.

2. When 'bluf' is preceded by 'lug', the output is 'blue blue', indicating that the color blue is both preceded and followed by the same word, 'bluf'.
3. When 'bluf' is preceded by 'wif', the output is 'red red', following the same logic as the above.
4. When 'bluf' is preceded by 'zup', the output is 'yellow yellow', which sustains the same pattern.
5. It is reasonable to assume now that 'bluf' does not have its own color, but instead duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

"Given the provided input and the corresponding output, the word ""walm"" appears to affect the output color's repetition. Let's examine each case:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   There is a repetition of 'blue' three times after 'walm.'

2. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   There is a repetition of 'green' three times after 'walm.'

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   There is a repetition of 'green' two times after 'walm.'

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color word to repeat three times in total in the output.",-0.0831373674277579,195,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, it's clear that ""walm"" corresponds to a particular rule in output. We can deduce the meaning by looking at the patterns and the changes in output color when ""walm"" is introduced in different positions.

Here are the outputs broken down with ""walm"" highlighted:

Input: zup lug **walm** wif dax
Output: yellow blue **blue blue** red green

Input: lug wif dax **walm** zup
Output: blue red green **green green** yellow

Input: wif **walm** zup lug zup **walm**
Output: red **red red** yellow blue yellow **yellow yellow**

Input: zup **walm**
Output: yellow **yellow yellow**

Input: dax **walm** wif
Output: green **green green** red

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" appears to cause the output to repeat the next color in sequence twice more, effectively tripling the next color in the sequence. ""Walm"" seems to serve as a signal to repeat the upcoming color two additional times. Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, it makes the next mentioned color appear twice more in a row in the output sequence. 

Hence:

walm -> Repeat the next color in the sequence two additional times.",-0.2983948344350106,195,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the colors that follow it, turning them into a sequence of identical colors. The specific color seems to be determined by the color that immediately precedes ""walm"". Here's the pattern derived from each input:

- In the first input, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" There is one ""lug"" which is blue, then ""walm"" is followed by three blues.
- In the second input, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" There is one ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and then ""walm"" follows with three greens.
- In the third input, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" ""Wif"" correlates with red, and it is followed by three reds after ""walm.""
- In the fourth input, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" is associated with yellow, and three yellows follow ""walm.""
- In the fifth input, ""dax walm"" again leads to ""green green green,"" consistent with the pattern.

From the examples given, we can induce the following rule:

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond directly to the word ""yellow"" when it is at the beginning of a sequence, and it repeats the number of times equal to its position in the sequence when it is not at the beginning. We can derive the following rule from the examples provided:

- When ""walm"" is the first word in a sequence, output is ""yellow"".
- When ""walm"" occurs later in the sequence, the output is ""yellow"" repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.

For instance:
- In the first sequence, ""walm"" is the third word, and the output is ""blue"" three times.
- In the second sequence, ""walm"" is the fourth word, and the output is ""green"" four times.
- In the third sequence, we have two ""walms"" in positions two and six, resulting in ""red"" repeated twice and ""yellow"" repeated six times, respectively.
- In the fourth sequence, ""walm"" is the second word, which gives us ""yellow"" twice.
- In the fifth sequence, ""walm"" is the second word, resulting in ""green"" repeated twice.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first examine the commonalities and differences across the provided examples:

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

First, note that the appearance of ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The repetitions and positions of these words correspond to the repetitions and positions of the colors in the output.

Now, let's focus on the occurrences of ""bluf"":

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows the words ""walm lug wif"" and precedes the colors ""blue red red."" From this one instance, we can't derive a clear pattern. 

In the second example, ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif"" and is translated to ""red red"" in the output. Since we already know that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" might be responsible for the repetition of ""red.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and gives ""yellow yellow"" in the output. This might reinforce the idea that ""bluf"" could be responsible for repeating the color that comes before it, as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" again follows either ""wif"" or ""zup"" and the corresponding color (""red"" or ""yellow"") is repeated twice in the output.

Considering these observations, ""bluf"" seems to cause the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.07944218238442856,196,bluf
"From the given examples, the pattern appears to be that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" As the word ""bluf"" seems to add the number of colors in the output, with ""yellow"" corresponding to the presence of ""zup"" and ""red"" to ""wif,"" the most reasonable deduction is that ""bluf"" is an instruction to repeat the previous color(s) given in the sequence. Since the presence of ""bluf"" always increases the number of colors in the output without introducing new colors, it does not correspond to a fixed color itself but rather to the repetition of the colors that appear before it.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" has a direct impact on the color that follows it in the sequence. Each time ""walm"" appears, the word following it is translated into a color. Let's analyze the examples to understand the rule.

In the first example:
Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

""walm"" appears twice. Following the first instance of ""walm,"" the color sequence is ""green yellow blue."" Following the second ""walm,"" the color is blue; however, since it's at the end, we don't know what would follow.

In the second example:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Here the word ""walm"" occurs at the end, so it corresponds to three ""red"" colors in a sequence at the end of the output.

The third example also supports the previous findings:
Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Again, ""walm"" is followed by ""green,"" like in the first example.

In the fourth example:
Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Following ""walm"" is ""blue,"" consistent with other observations when ""walm"" is not at the end of the sequence.

The fifth example only involves ""dax"" following ""walm,"" resulting in:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, ""walm"" precedes the repetition of green three times, just like ""dax.""

Based on the occurrences, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a rule where the color following it is repeated three times. However, if ""walm"" comes at the end of the sequence, the last color is repeated three times instead.

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by another word, the corresponding color for the next word is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the color corresponding to the last word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" dictates the repetition of the color associated with the previous word, for the number of times equal to the number of letters in ""walm"". Observing the examples given:

- Example 1: ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" which indicates that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") three times because ""walm"" has four letters.
- Example 2: ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" which indicates that ""walm"" causes the color ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") to be repeated three times again.
- Example 3: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" gives us ""green green green"" following ""dax walm"", maintaining the repetition of ""green"" three times.
- Example 4: ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue"", again repeating the color associated with the previous word, which is ""blue"" for ""lug"".
- Example 5: ""dax walm"" translates once again to ""green green green"", reinforcing the pattern.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-1.0029195007938616,196,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the provided examples, let's examine the output each time ""walm"" is used and compare it to the other words:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes another ""walm,"" resulting in the output ""yellow blue blue blue."" Since the output corresponding to ""lug"" is ""yellow,"" we see that the first ""walm"" leads to a ""blue."" The second ""walm"" also leads to ""blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" consistently results in a ""blue"" output.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end of the input and results in a series of ""red"" colors in the output sequence. We notice that ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and results in ""red"" as well, so ""walm"" in this context also seems to generate multiple ""red"" in the output.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which results in a ""green"" in the output. Again, ""walm"" resulted in ""green green green"" at the start and ""blue green"" in the middle, with ""blue"" directly tied to the presence of ""walm.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"" and before ""wif,"" and the corresponding output is ""blue blue blue red."" We see the ""blue"" associated with ""walm"" and ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green."" Once more, we see ""walm"" associated with multiple ""green.""

From these observations, we see that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word it follows. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color is green and it repeats. After ""lug,"" the color is blue and it repeats once. When ""walm"" precedes another word, it appears to repeat the color associated with that subsequent word, but when standing alone, it repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is related to the color represented in the output after its occurrence. We can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by comparing the inputs with their respective outputs and looking for patterns specifically associated with the appearance of ""walm."" Analyzing each example:

- In the first input, ""walm"" appears twice, and in the output, we see ""green yellow blue blue blue."" The green follows ""dax,"" then after the first ""walm,"" we have two instances of ""green,"" followed by ""yellow"" and then three instances of ""blue,"" which correlates with the following word ""lug"" and the repetition of ""walm.""
- The second input has ""walm"" at the end, and the output ends with three instances of ""red."" Notably, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red"" in the output.
- The third input has ""walm"" after ""dax,"" and in the output again, we see a repetition of green followed by a yellow and a green associated with ""dax.""
- The fourth input contains ""walm"" in the middle of the sequence, and the output sequence is ""yellow blue,"" followed by repeated ""blue,"" a ""red,"" and a ""green."" The repeated ""blue"" is linked with ""walm"" again.
- The fifth input is simply ""dax walm,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that precedes it, which in this case is ""green.""

Based on this analysis:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
4. When ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, we see a series of ""green"" that matches the number of ""dax"" prior to it.
5. When ""walm"" is not followed by another word, it appears to take on the value of ""green.""

Considering these patterns, it seems the word ""walm"" operates as a modifier or multiplier for the color associated with the word that precedes it. It's as if ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word a certain number of times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

""walm"" -> Indicates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, with the number of repetitions depending on the specific context.

Example 3:

Example 4:

From the given examples, we can observe:

- When ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- ""Wif"" does not seem to depend on its position in the input to correspond to ""red"" in the output.
- Whenever ""wif"" is used multiple times, ""red"" appears the same number of times in the output.

Analyzing these patterns, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it. This is the consistent pattern that can be derived from the given examples.

4. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

Looking for patterns, we can see that ""wif"" always results in the word ""red"" in the output. Let's now check where ""wif"" is in relation to other words:

- When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" ""red"" follows ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" ""red"" follows ""blue.""
- ""wif"" by itself followed by ""bluf"" is ""red red.""

2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif  Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue"" (by its repeated correspondence).
   - ""wif"" again corresponds with ""red"" at the end.
   - Since ""wif"" corresponds with ""green"" earlier in the sentence, it suggests ""wif"" has a variable meaning, possibly dependent on the word just before it.

3. Input: wif bluf  Output: red red
   - ""bluf"" has only ""red"" left to correspond with, but since ""wif"" leads, and ""red red"" follows, it indicates ""wif"" can mean ""red"" by itself or in certain contexts.

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm  Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" is confirmed as ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" when it follows ""zup"", but not when it precedes ""lug"".
  
5. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax  Output: green blue yellow red red green

- Input: wif walm dax zup

- Input: lug dax walm
  Output: blue green green green
  The initial word ""lug"" gives a ""blue,"" followed by ""dax"" with a ""green,"" and then ""walm,"" which causes a repeat of the previous color twice, resulting in two more ""green.""

- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color output twice. Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color that immediately preceded it to be repeated in the next two output terms.

Rule:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its occurrence and the corresponding outputs in each example:

1. dax walm wif walm

   - ""wif"" in the context after ""walm"" leads to ""red.""

3. wif lug zup walm wif lug

   - ""wif"" leads to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" between ""zup"" and ""wif"" results in two more ""yellow.""

   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in two more ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the output.

Based on the examples, ""walm"" appears to duplicate the color output of the word preceding it by two. We don't have an example where ""walm"" appears at the beginning of the input, so based on what we do have, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When following another keyword, ""walm"" repeats the color output associated with that keyword twice more.",-0.09363333864506189,197,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" dictates that every word following it, including itself, is to be repeated three times in the output sequence, corresponding to their assigned colors.

For example:

- ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red"" because ""dax"" and ""wif"" both follow the first occurrence of ""walm"", and thus each is translated to its color three times. The second ""walm"" has no following words, so it is repeated in the output as ""red"" three times.
- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"" because ""dax"" and ""zup"" follow the ""walm"" and are each translated to their color but repeated three times only for ""dax"" since it is the word directly following ""walm"".
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"" since ""walm"" appears in the fourth position and the word ""wif"" directly follows it, it is translated as ""yellow"" and repeated three times. ""lug"" retains its one-time mention of ""blue"".

So, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes each word after it, starting with itself, to be translated into its corresponding color three times, while words before it are translated once.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color of each word following this one, including itself, three times.",-0.6040250528712371,197,walm
"To discern the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its usage across the given examples.

In the first input, ""walm"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by a series of three consecutive colors. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" and ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""

In the second input, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which is consistent with the first input.

In the third input, the pattern breaks because ""walm"" is followed by a different color pattern: ""walm wif lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red blue,"" which diverges from the previous patterns. We need to examine more input.

In the fourth input, ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" might be tied to the word that precedes it in some fashion, as ""dax"" led to three greens in the first input.

In the fifth input, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" So ""walm"" followed by ""lug"" leads to another color ""blue,"" as seen before ""lug"" led to blue in the third and fourth input.

So, ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color of the next word mentioned after it, producing a sequence of three colors that are the same as the first color that follows ""walm."" The exceptions are ""lug"" and ""wif"" which change the pattern, introducing a new color or colors to the sequence.

However, looking into it further, a single exception occurs when two distinct non-walm words follow walm, as seen in the last input example. It can be noted that ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to yellow consistently.

Through this analysis, we can piece together the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" generates a sequence of three of the next color mentioned. If the words ""lug"" or ""wif"" are either before or after ""walm,"" they may modify the color pattern directly after ""walm,"" overriding the initial duplicating pattern.

Thus, the rule we're looking for is:

""walm"" -> Generates three instances of the color that follows it, unless ""lug"" or ""wif"" are involved, which modify the resulting color pattern.",-0.6620737371984534,197,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe that the output colors appear in groups and the appearance of ""walm"" changes the sequence of colors that follow. We can also notice that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. For example, ""dax"" always leads to ""green,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow."" When ""walm"" is present, it seems to act as a toggle or switch for the sequence of colors that follow it. It causes the order of colors to change in a specific way.

Let's write out the correspondences we can observe:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow

Now looking at the color sequences following a ""walm"", we can write:

- ""walm wif"" in example 1 results in ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes ""wif"" to output triple red instead of single red.
- ""walm dax"" in example 2 does not immediately follow, so in this context ""walm"" alone results in a single red.
- ""walm wif lug"" in example 3 again results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" following it, except for the last “lug” which follows its normal pattern of corresponding to “blue”.
- ""walm"" in example 4 turns the following ""dax"" into a sequence of triple green.
- In example 5, ""walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" despite ""lug"" typically corresponding to blue, and ""walm wif"" afterwards leads into a double red.

Putting all of this together, ""walm"" seems to cause the next color in the sequence to be tripled, except for when the last word of the sequence is ""walm,"" or when ""walm"" directly follows another ""walm"" as seen in examples 1 and 5. This rule is slightly inconsistent with example 3, but based on the majority of the evidence, this seems to be the pattern.

- In this example, ""zup"" is preceded by ""walm"" and followed by ""lug"", translating to ""yellow blue"", and in another instance, ""zup"" is at the end after ""walm"" which correlates to ""yellow"". 

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow
- Similar to the first example, ""zup"" comes after ""wif bluf,"" which is ""red red,"" so ""zup"" once again is ""yellow.""

Input: dax zup dax walm

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to the input elements and identify patterns. We’ll focus on the position of ""bluf"" and its adjacent elements and corresponding outputs.

Here are the patterns identified from the given examples:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
3. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
4. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
5. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

We notice that the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in color immediately after ""bluf"":

1. dax (green) bluf (green)
2. zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) wif (red)
3. lug (blue) bluf (blue) wif (red)
4. zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) wif (red)
5. lug (blue) bluf (blue) dax (green)

In each case, ""bluf"" is followed by the color that corresponds to the word right before it. Hence, ""bluf"" seems to act as a repeater or duplicator for the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word preceding it.",-0.09354254849588661,198,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input string, it consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.

For instance:
- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"", with ""bluf"" relating to the second ""green"".
- In the second example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" maps to ""red yellow yellow red green"", with ""bluf"" corresponding to the last ""green"" in the sequence.
- The pattern holds in all the other examples provided.

Therefore, we can induce that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it always translates to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> green.",-1.0476165696935051,198,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the output of each sentence and compare it to the input. It appears that each word in the input (including ""bluf"") is translated to a color in the output:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" is a little trickier as it only appears once, but in the context, it appears to translate to ""yellow.""

Looking at the placement of ""bluf"" in each of the inputs and its corresponding color in the outputs, ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to ""green"" in each instance it appears. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""",-1.145719614104124,198,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the next word.,-1.8431290531092774,198,bluf
"Examining the examples, let's try to deduce the pattern that describes the meaning or rule behind the nonce word 'walm'.

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - The word 'walm' corresponds to 'yellow' following 'zup'.

2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - The word 'walm' corresponds to 'blue' following 'lug'.

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - The word 'walm' corresponds to 'blue' following 'lug'.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - The word 'walm' corresponds to 'green' following 'dax'.

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - The word 'walm' corresponds to 'yellow' following 'zup'.

Based on these examples, 'walm' seems to take on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Let's consolidate this rule with the following formulation:

Rule: walm -> taking on the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

For instance, if 'walm' follows 'zup', which is associated with 'yellow', then 'walm' translates to 'yellow'. If it follows 'lug', associated with 'blue', then 'walm' is 'blue'. If it follows 'dax', associated with 'green', then 'walm' is 'green'.",-0.06806082903024271,198,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for the patterns and consistent changes in the output when ""walm"" is present in the input. Let's compare the input sequences that include ""walm"" and their corresponding output sequences.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Analyzing the sequences:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
3. If ""walm"" features after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
4. ""Walm"" replicates the color of the word before it in the output pattern.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" functions as a repeater of the color of the previous word used in the sequence. Consequently, ""walm"" outputs the same color as the word right before it. 

Rule: walm -> repeats the color code of the previous word.",-0.07412591842766988,198,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided, focusing on the colors that correspond to instances of ""walm"" in the input.

In the first input, ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
In the second input, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.
In the third input, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""
In the fourth input, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""
In the fifth input, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given the inconsistency in the color associated with ""walm,"" let's look at the position of ""walm"" in the sequence to see if it changes based on the word preceding it:

1. ""lug zup wif dax"" yields ""blue yellow red green,"" but ""zup walm lug"" yields ""yellow yellow blue.""
2. No such pattern appears to be associated with ""walm"" and the preceding word ""lug,"" as ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue,"" and ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue.""
3. The output color does not reliably follow a pattern based on the word following ""walm"" either, as different colors follow ""walm"" in the inputs.

Given these observations, it is challenging to induce a rule-based pattern for ""walm"" based solely on the provided inputs and outputs. The term ""walm"" could be context-sensitive or dependent on the surrounding words, but we'd need a more consistent set of examples to determine a clear rule. However, if ""walm"" were to signify a color, it could plausibly represent ""blue,"" because out of the five provided inputs, it corresponds to ""blue"" three times. Yet this is not consistent, as ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""green"" in different contexts.

Hence, without additional information or examples, it's not possible to provide a definitive rule for ""walm."" However, the most frequent association, albeit imperfect, is:

Rule: ""walm"" most frequently corresponds to the color blue, but this is not consistent.",-0.9786438472674758,198,walm
"Rule: Walm means ""to repeat the color of the previous word.""

Examples:

1. In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"", since 'zup' precedes 'walm' and is translated as yellow, 'walm' is also translated as yellow.

2. In ""zup lug walm wif dax"", 'lug' comes before 'walm' and 'lug' is translated as blue, so 'walm' is also translated as blue.

3. In ""dax lug dax lug walm"", 'lug' precedes 'walm' and since 'lug' corresponds to blue, 'walm' translates to blue as well.

4. In ""dax walm zup lug"", because 'dax' is before 'walm' and 'dax' means green, 'walm' is green too.

5. In ""zup wif lug zup walm"", 'zup' is right before 'walm' and is translated to yellow, thus 'walm' here is yellow too.

So, the rule is based on repetition of the color associated with the last mentioned word.

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in each input and their corresponding outputs:

1. Example 1:
   - Input: zup dax wif
   - Output: yellow green red
   We observe that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and the presence of ""wif"" leads to the word ""red.""

2. Example 2:
   - Input: lug zup wif zup
   - Output: blue yellow red yellow
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" as before. The presence of ""wif"" in a sequence leads to ""red,"" and then ""zup"" continues to correspond to ""yellow.""

3. Example 3:
   - Input: zup bluf wif walm
   - Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow"" in this case as well. ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" producing a sequence of ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" introduces a series of ""red"" related to the term that follows.

4. Example 4:
   - Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   - Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""walm"" following ""dax"" changes the output to ""green"" as well. However, ""wif"" at the end reverts the correspondence for ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and adds ""red.""

5. Example 5:
   - Input: wif bluf lug zup
   - Output: red red blue yellow
   ""wif"" at the beginning yields ""red,"" ""bluf"" now corresponds to ""red,"" potentially confirming that ""wif"" affects the term that follows it, as with ""walm"" in the previous example, ""lug"" to ""blue,"" as previously seen, and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, a potential rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and affects the term that follows it, causing a repetition of ""red"" according to some characteristic of the following term (e.g., ""walm"" leads to a tripling of ""red""). However, if ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence or not followed by another term, it simply translates to ""red.""

Given the examples, there isn't a consistent rule established for how ""wif"" affects the following term since it changes ""walm"" to three reds and ""bluf"" to one red. To establish a solid rule about its effect on the following terms, more data with variability in the terms after ""wif"" would be required. For now, we can tentatively state the rule as follows:

Rule: wif -> red, and potentially modifies the following word's output to red(s) based on an undetermined characteristic of that word.",-0.11147422107674158,199,wif
"Based on the examples provided, wif corresponds to a particular color in the output sequence. To deduce the meaning of wif, we need to establish a pattern or a rule that links the input containing wif to the corresponding output color.

In the outputs, the last color that precedes wif consistently appears to be red, no matter what other words precede or follow wif in the inputs. This suggests that wif translates to the color red in the output. However, we must ensure that wif itself is not another color that could potentially match red under certain conditions, by looking at all instances of the outputs and confirming the consistency of its translation:

1. zup dax wif -> yellow green red (wif correlates with red)
2. lug zup wif zup -> blue yellow red yellow (wif correlates with red)
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (wif correlates with red)
4. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red (wif correlates with red)
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow (wif correlates with red)

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of outputs corresponding to its presence in the input.

1. In the first example, ""zup walm wif"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Without ""walm,"" the sequence ""zup wif"" usually produces ""yellow red."" Therefore, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" (blue) three times.

3. The third example, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" gives ""green green green red red."" Here, ""dax"" typically corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" seems to repeat ""green"" two more times following the existing pattern. ""Wif"" and ""bluf"" add ""red red"" to the end of the sequence.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue."" Again, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green).

5. The fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" shows ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif"" typically corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the color ""red"" to be repeated two more times.

Based on the pattern observed, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times in total. If ""walm"" appears after a color word, it seems to generate two additional occurrences of the output color corresponding to that word. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times in total.",-0.08819610713857833,199,walm
"From the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" generates a series of same-colored outputs. The number of times this color is repeated corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input sentence:

2. lug walm -> blue blue blue (walm produces three blues)
3. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red (walm produces three greens)
4. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue (walm produces three greens)
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (walm produces three reds)

- ""zup,"" the color is yellow.
- ""lug,"" the color is blue.
- ""dax,"" the color is green.

In addition, ""walm"" at the end of the sentence after ""wif,"" which correlates to red in all examples, results in a repetition of reds. However, walm's color production also considers its position.
