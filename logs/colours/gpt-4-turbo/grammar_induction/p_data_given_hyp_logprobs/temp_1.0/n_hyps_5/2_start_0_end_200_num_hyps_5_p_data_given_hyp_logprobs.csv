"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" 

Here's how this conclusion is reached:

- Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""lug"" in the input matches the position of ""blue"" in the output.
- The words ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" seem to correspond to different colors—red, yellow, green, and a repeated color respectively—since their presence and position in the input influence the resulting colors in the output.

Painting the rule clearly:

Rule: lug -> blue.
From the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Let's analyze each example.

- In the first input, the sequence 'wif zup dax' corresponds to 'red yellow green'. Since 'wif' correlates with 'red' and 'zup' with 'yellow', it would imply 'dax' correlates with 'green'.
- In the second example, 'zup lug zup wif dax' translates to 'yellow blue yellow red green'. Following the previous logic, 'lug' should mean 'blue', and if 'wif' and 'zup' continue to mean 'red' and 'yellow' respectively, 'dax' should again mean 'green'.
- In the third example, 'lug dax bluf zup lug wif' translates to 'blue green green yellow blue red’. Here we see 'lug' is 'blue' and 'zup' is 'yellow' and 'wif' is 'red' as before. 'bluf' consequently must mean 'green', but since it appears after 'dax', it seems 'dax' does not affect the color meaning of 'bluf' since it also means 'green'.
- The fourth example 'dax wif walm' becomes 'green red red red’. 'wif' remains consistent as 'red', but we do not have a previous meaning for 'walm'. Since 'walm' follows 'wif' and they both translate to 'red', it could be deduced that 'walm' means 'red' if 'wif' precedes it, or it could be that 'dax' has a duplicating effect, but further examples would be needed for concrete evidence of that rule.
- In the fifth example, 'dax bluf' turns into 'green green'. Since from the third example we know 'bluf' means 'green' and here 'dax' is followed by 'green' again, it reinforces that 'dax' means 'green'.

Considering all the examples and deducing the pattern, the rule appears to be consistent: 

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is part of the corresponding output:

Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green red red blue
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: wif -> Output: red

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" is represented by the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Regardless of its position in a sequence, ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"".
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the corresponding output in each example. Let's align each ""bluf"" with its output:

1. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

2. zup dax bluf
   yellow green green

3. zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   yellow yellow red green red yellow

4. wif walm lug bluf
   red red red blue blue

5. wif dax bluf
   red green green

Now, we'll compare the outputs:

1. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
2. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
3. ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red.""
4. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue blue.""
5. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""

From these examples, it is clear that ""bluf"" does not correspond directly to a consistent color output. However, we see that in examples 1, 2, and 5, where ""bluf"" follows another word (""lug"" and ""dax""), it repeats the color produced by the word that precedes it, suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean to repeat the previous color.

However, in the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" with outputs ""yellow red,"" which does not immediately lend itself to the repetition rule. But, if we assume that ""bluf"" means repeat and ""wif"" means red (as supported by the other examples), then the sequence may mean that ""bluf"" caused the previous color ""yellow"" to repeat, and ""wif"" introduced the new color ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" corresponds with ""red blue blue."" At first glance, this seems inconsistent with the repetition rule, but if we consider a possible error in the input or output, the repetition rule might still hold. If the sequence were supposed to be ""wif wif lug bluf"" (red red blue blue), this would be consistent with the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color.

Considering the evidence from all five examples, one possible interpretation is that ""bluf"" causes the previous color to repeat, as supported by most examples when ""bluf"" follows another noun. The anomaly in the third and fourth examples could potentially be explained by errors or a misinterpretation of the rule.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to the word ""red"" repeated three times. To confirm this, let's analyze how ""walm"" changes the output in each example:

- In the first example, each ""wif walm"" sequence translates to ""red red red,"" followed by ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" with ""lug"" translated to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" meaning ""wif walm"" consistently translates to ""red red red.""
- The third example shows ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" and the sequence ""wif walm"" again translates to ""red red red,"" while ""lug zup walm"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" showcasing that ""walm"" alone translates to the color ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- The fourth example shows ""lug walm wif"" translating to ""blue blue blue red,"" indicating that ""walm"" on its own translates to ""blue"" repeated three times.
- The fifth example, consisting solely of ""lug walm,"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" reaffirming the pattern.

From these observations, the rule can be derived as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to the color word immediately preceding it repeated three times.

Therefore, we can define walm as follows:

walm -> meaning: the previous color word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,0
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each output, regardless of the position of the word ""lug"" within the input sequence or the presence of other words.
From the provided examples, we can try to observe patterns and infer the meaning or rule behind the word ""dax."" Let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green."" The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"" in this case.

2. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" In this sequence, ""dax"" again seems to correspond to the color ""green,"" and it is flanked by the color ""red"" represented by ""wif.""

3. ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red."" ""dax"" here is followed by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" and precedes ""zup"" (yellow). ""walm"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""dax"" again seems to correspond to ""green.""

5. ""lug dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green green green red."" The word ""dax"" is between ""lug"" (blue) and ""walm"" (red). ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" between these colors.

Considering all these examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each word corresponds to a color:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" except after ""wif,"" where it corresponds to ""red"" in the second example (lug wif lug bluf) and to ""green"" in the third example (dax bluf wif zup).
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

However, we notice that the word ""wif"" always results in the word after it translating to ""red,"" if there is a word after it, which is seen in the examples given (except when ""wif"" stands alone, in which case it just translates to ""red""). Therefore, ""wif"" appears to be a modifier that changes the color associated with the next word to ""red,"" or it represents ""red"" by itself when it stands alone. 

The rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" -> When followed by another word, it changes the associated color of the next word to red. If standing alone, ""wif"" means red.
Based on the given examples, zup translates to ""yellow"" consistently across the examples. It does not seem to be context-dependent or variable, as it consistently corresponds to the same color regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to associate the nonce word ""bluf"" with the color that precedes it in the input sequence. It is consistently repeating the color that appears immediately before it.

Here are the associations in each example to illustrate the rule:

- Example 1: ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"", which is ""red"".
- Example 2: ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- Example 3: ""dax bluf"" in ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" following the previous ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- Example 4: ""dax bluf"" in ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" following the ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- Example 5: ""lug bluf"" in ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" following the ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

So, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and ""walm"" indicates that ""blue"" should be repeated twice more.

- In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" means ""red"" is repeated twice more, followed by ""dax"" and ""zup"" which correspond to colors ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

- In the third example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The second ""zup"" is again ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated twice more.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat twice more.

- In the fifth example, ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat twice, and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,1
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, it appears that each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Here is the breakdown of the given examples:

1. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Each word translates to a color, with ""lug"" corresponding to the first instance of ""blue.""

2. ""lug zup wif zup"" results in ""blue yellow red yellow."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" once again.

3. ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green,"" and ""lug"" is matched with ""blue"" in the sequence.

4. ""lug zup"" results in ""blue yellow,"" with ""lug"" translating to ""blue.""

5. ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" where both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be consistent:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: Each English word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output, with ""dax"" consistently translating to ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each input containing ""wif"" results in an output including ""red"". Additionally, other nonce words seem to map to other colors: ""dax"" translates to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow, as evidenced by their consistent pairing with those colors in the outputs.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the color that is mentioned immediately before it. ""Bluf"" seems to copy the color word that precedes it:

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm"" precedes ""bluf"", and the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""bluf"" takes the color before it, which is ""yellow"".
- In the second example, there is no color word before ""bluf"", so it doesn't seem to take on a color, as evidenced by ""red red green"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""lug"" generates ""blue"", so ""bluf"" also results in ""blue"".
- Similarly, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which results in ""blue"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"" as well.

Rule: bluf -> the color word that occurs immediately before ""bluf"" in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no color word precedes it, the rule cannot be applied, but based on the given examples, it seems that ""red"" is the default output in such cases.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and the outputs:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

Considering the above examples, it appears that when ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" In the provided examples, ""walm"" is not a standalone color but seems to replicate the color stated before it three times. 

For example:
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" with ""lug"" being associated with blue, then repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" with ""dax"" being associated with green, then repeated three times.

In the case where ""walm"" is surrounded by different words, such as in ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" the output is ""green red red red blue yellow,"" with ""wif"" being associated with red and repeated three times following the sequence.

Based on these observations, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Rule:

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,2
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue"". Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" has a consistent output every time it appears. ""Dax"" results in ""green"" in each example, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Here's the analysis of each input/output pair:

- Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Input: dax bluf | Output: green green. ""Dax"" is the first word and still corresponds to ""green"".
- Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf | Output: yellow green yellow green red red. Each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Input: dax | Output: green. Alone, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"".
- Input: dax | Output: green. The repetition of the example reinforces that ""dax"" consistently equals ""green"".

Rule:
dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine how it corresponds to the outputs in each example.

In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Notice that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red,"" while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the second example, ""dax zup wif zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""

In the third example, ""wif zup lug zup lug"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue yellow blue."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red."" Once more, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the fifth example, ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red."" In this case, ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""

Across all these examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" no matter its position or the words around it. Therefore, based on current information, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word is systematically associated with a particular color. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. It does not change regardless of its position or the words that precede or follow it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the examples:

1. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow

2. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

3. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

It appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output.

Rule:
bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its impact on the output across all given examples.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- ""Walm"" causes a repetition of the color for ""wif,"" which is red, three times before proceeding to ""zup.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""Walm"" leads to ""dax"" being repeated in color three times, which is green.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- In this case, ""walm"" results in repeating the color for ""wif"" three times, which is red.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Once again, ""walm"" causes the color for ""zup"" to be repeated, this time as three yellows.

Based on the above, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax bluf
    ",Output: red green red,red green green,False,3
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the input and output patterns provided in the examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" and its usage within the examples.

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here, and given that the output is ""yellow green"", this reinforces that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
- If we assume ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as previously deduced, then ""lug"" would correspond to ""blue"".

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- In this example, each word appears to correspond to a color repeated an equal number of times. Since ""wif"" is consistently ""red"" and we've deduced ""dax"" as ""green"", ""walm"" is likely the word that repeats the color of the prior word in the sequence.

Input: lug zup dax lug dax
Output: blue yellow green blue green
- Following the same logic, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:
- dax appears to correspond to the color ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Here's a breakdown based on the examples:

- Every instance of ""zup"" results in ""yellow"".
- Other words in the input result in different colors: ""walm"" results in ""blue"", ""lug"" results in ""blue"", ""wif"" results in ""red"", ""dax"" results in ""green"", and ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"".
- It seems like the mapping of words to colors is one-to-one except for ""bluf"" which is also mapped to ""yellow,"" but since we are specifically looking at ""zup,"" we'll focus on that.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf represents a repetition of the color denoted by the word preceding it. 

For example:
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" causes ""lug"" (which means ""blue"") to be repeated.
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" causes ""wif"" (which means ""red"") to be repeated.
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" causes ""zup"" (which means ""yellow"") to be repeated. 

Therefore, bluf -> repetition of the color word that comes before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern of the outputs in relation to its position:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"":
   - Input: dax walm wif bluf
   - Output: green green green red red

2. When ""walm"" is before ""dax"":
   - Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   - Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"":
   - Input: lug wif walm
   - Output: blue red red red

4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"":
   - Input: lug walm
   - Output: blue blue blue

5. When ""walm"" is the last word following ""dax"":
   - Input: wif bluf dax walm
   - Output: red red green green green

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- In example 1, the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in a series of ""green.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" and still, there's a ""green"" following ""dax.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in a series of ""red.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in a series of ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows directly after ""dax,"" again leading to a series of ""green.""

What's apparent from these examples is that ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Hence, the rule for ""walm"" might be that it repeats the color of the previous word a certain number of times, possibly until the string ends or a new color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> when presented in a sequence, ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat for the next outputs, extending the sequence of that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"" in every given example, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, ""lug"" means blue.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

From these examples, we see that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. It does not seem to be affected by its position or by the words that come before or after it.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Additionally, each other nonce word translates to a specific color. The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" So when ""wif"" appears in the input, regardless of the position or accompanying words, ""red"" is always present in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to represent the word ""blue"" modified in some manner. To discern the rule, we can examine the correspondence between the inputs and outputs.

1. ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue."" Here, bluf correlates with ""blue.""
2. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" becomes ""green green red yellow green."" Considering the position and occurrence of ""bluf,"" it seems to mirror ""dax"" which is ""green.""
3. ""zup wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow red red."" The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color word, ""red"" in this case.
4. ""dax lug bluf"" becomes ""green blue blue."" In this context, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
5. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" becomes ""yellow blue red green green red."" Again, ""bluf"" mirrors the color mentioned before it, which is ""green"" from ""dax"" in this case.

From these examples, the pattern suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it, resulting in a repetition of that color in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the prior word in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs to identify patterns:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""walm"" results in a  repetition of the preceding color three times.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""walm"" results in a repetition of the last mentioned color.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" does not seem to have an output, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""walm"" again results in a repetition of the last mentioned color.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats it.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""bluf"" does not have an output, ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""walm"" repeats the color mentioned before it, ""lug"" remains ""blue"".

By analyzing all the examples, we can see that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the immediately preceding color word in the input, and it seems that it repeats the color three times, except when the color is repeated at the end of the input (as seen in the input ""lug walm"").

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the last mentioned color word three times in the output; if ""walm"" is at the end of the input, repeat the last mentioned color just once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the same output regardless of its position within the sequence. Hence, the rule is quite straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Each occurrence of the word ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the number of times ""green"" appears in the output is directly proportional to the number of times ""dax"" appears in the input.

However, since the examples provided do not show variation in the appearance of ""dax"" (it always appears once in each input except for the examples that are exactly the same), we cannot deduce a variation in the meaning of ""dax"" beyond its consistent translation to ""green."" 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
dax -> green

It implies that ""dax"" is being interpreted as signifying the word ""green"", regardless of what follows ""dax"" (as seen in ""dax walm"" and ""dax bluf""). If additional context or examples were provided where ""dax"" appears more than once in a single input or is combined with other words beyond ""walm"" and ""bluf"", we could refine the rule further.
From these examples, we can deduce the following:

- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and it is inferred that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because ""zup"" is consistent in relation to ""yellow.""

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" We know that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" produces the same output as ""wif,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red."" ""dax"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""green,"" and since there is an extra ""green,"" it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to two instances of ""green.""

- ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green."" Here, ""wif"" maintains its correspondence to ""red,"" and, based on previous examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" ""zup"" is ""yellow"" once again, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Notably, ""walm"" produces ""red red"" which is consistent with the earlier observation that ""walm"" produces multiple instances of a color. In this case, it's multiple instances of ""red.""

- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

With these observations, it is apparent that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given examples:

1. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif 
   Output: yellow blue red green green red

2. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Observations:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is blue (Ex: lug bluf -> blue blue).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is yellow (Ex: zup bluf -> yellow yellow).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green (Ex: dax bluf -> green green).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output color is red (Ex: dax wif bluf -> green red red).

Rule:
Bluf seems to repeat the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it. For instance, if the word that maps to ""blue"" precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"", and so on for other colors.

Thus the rule is: Bluf -> The same color as the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples and look for a pattern associated with this word. Let's break down each input and its corresponding output to see how ""walm"" affects the result:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word just before it three times.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   Rule: Here, ""walm"" also causes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times, before continuing with the colors associated with ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red).
   
3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to repeat three times, followed by the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red).

4. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Rule: Both ""zup"" and ""lug"" have their associated colors outputted once, but when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color associated with ""lug"" is repeated three more times.

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Rule: The pattern is consistent; ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated three times, before moving on to the color associated with the next word, ""dax"" (green).

Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in an input, it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be outputted three times in a row, before proceeding with any subsequent colors associated with words that may follow.

walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,6
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of the context or the other words present. Therefore, ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

When ""dax"" is present on its own, the output is consistently ""green."" However, when there is a second word following ""dax,"" the color corresponding to ""dax"" remains ""green,"" and the second word seems to determine the second color in the output. In the given examples, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The rule does not provide information on what the second word would be translated to if it were to stand alone, but within the context of being preceded by ""dax,"" the rule for the subsequent word's associated color is indicated.
Wif -> The presence of the nonce word ""wif"" always results in the output starting with the color ""red."" The subsequent words (if any) following ""wif"" appear to correspond to additional colors in a fixed sequence. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" In the case where ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which is not present in other examples, the output is ""red red,"" implying that ""bluf"" might be interpreted as indicating a repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" or as a null operation that does not change the output sequence but adds an additional ""red.""

Rule:
1. ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""
2. ""wif"" followed by ""lug"" translates to ""red blue.""
3. ""wif"" followed by ""lug dax"" translates to ""red blue green.""
4. ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" translates to ""red red.""

Without additional context or examples, especially examples containing ""bluf"" with other words or ""dax"" without ""lug,"" it is challenging to deduce a more comprehensive rule for every possible word that could follow ""wif."" It is assumed that if ""wif"" were followed by an unknown word not provided in the examples, a new, as yet undetermined color would be assigned in sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"", independent of the surrounding words. Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to a color that corresponds to the color mentioned directly before it. In each case, the output color that follows ""bluf"" is the same as the color that precedes it. So, in the given context, ""bluf"" acts as a mirror or copying function for colors.

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color directly preceding it.
walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. For example, when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times in the output. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times in the output. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated, with the number of repetitions depending on the sequence (two repetitions if ""lug"" is mentioned once before ""walm"" and three if ""zup"" and ""lug"" precede ""walm"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,7
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided where the input contains the nonce word ""lug"" and the output consistently shows the color ""blue"", we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's first look at the given examples and their corresponding outputs. This will help us see where ""dax"" appears and what is produced as a result:

1. Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
2. Input: lug dax bluf -> Output: blue green green
3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow
5. Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Rule deduction with ""dax"" present:
- In every case where ""dax"" is present, the word ""green"" appears in the output in the subsequent position.
- The other colors correspond to the words preceding ""dax,"" following a specific pattern:
  - ""lug"" matches with ""blue""
  - ""wif"" matches with ""red""
  - ""zup"" matches with ""yellow""
  - ""walm"" likely matches with ""yellow"" as well, as seen in examples 4 and 5
  - ""bluf"" has not been given a direct example, but it produces ""green"" after ""lug dax,"" indicating either a repeat of the previous color, or a possible association to ""green"" in a different context.

Based on this, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: dax -> ""green""
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. In the first two examples, ""wif"" is followed by the word ""red"" in the output:
   - Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   - Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red

2. In the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" alone is also associated with the word ""red"":
   - Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
   - Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - Input: wif -> Output: red

Based on these examples, it seems that regardless of the context, ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the output. Other words lead to different colors (e.g., ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow), but ""wif"" is not dependent on those contexts.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red.""
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be simple and consistent. The nonce word ""zup"" correlates to a specific color whenever it appears in the input. The output associated with ""zup"" is always ""yellow"". Additionally, when ""zup"" is used in conjunction with another word like ""wif"", the corresponding color ""red"" is added to the output sequence alongside ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be described as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it.

- In ""dax lug bluf dax,"" bluf takes on the meaning of ""blue"" because the word directly preceding it is ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue.
- In ""dax bluf,"" bluf takes on the meaning of ""green"" because the word directly preceding it is ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green.
- In ""lug bluf,"" bluf takes on the meaning of ""blue"" for the same reason as the first example.
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" bluf takes on the meaning of ""red"" because the word directly preceding it is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red.
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" bluf again takes on the meaning of ""red"" as in the previous example.
From analyzing the examples given:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug dax zup dax,"" the output continues a pattern (""blue green yellow green"") by repeating the last color twice more (""green green"") and then changes to red (""red"").
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax zup,"" the output repeats the last color (""yellow"") twice more (""yellow yellow"") and then changes to red twice (""red red"").
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is three reds (""red red red"").
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is three blues (""blue blue blue"").
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is three yellows (""yellow yellow yellow"").

Based on this information, it seems that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the last mentioned color three times before switching to red. The one exception to this is when ""walm"" follows a sequence of colors, then it continues the last mentioned color twice before switching to red. However, due to limited context, this exception may not be a firm rule but rather an observation based on the provided data.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repetition of the last mentioned color three times, then switch to red. If ""walm"" follows a sequence, continue the last mentioned color twice before switching to red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by looking at its position relative to other words and the corresponding color outputs.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
2. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
3. ""zup lug zup dax"" -> ""yellow blue yellow green""
4. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
5. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow green green green blue red""

In each of these examples, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" There's no instance where ""dax"" corresponds to a different color, regardless of the words that precede or follow it. We can thus infer that ""dax"" reliably maps to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Given the examples provided, we can try to establish the rule by looking for a pattern:

1. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
2. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
3. wif dax bluf -> red green green
4. lug zup dax wif zup -> blue yellow green red yellow
5. wif zup -> red yellow

Looking at the patterns, ""wif"" doesn't have a direct one-to-one correspondence with any particular color like the other words do (i.e., ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow). Instead, ""wif"" seems to always translate to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the word ""zup"" seems consistent and can be deduced as follows:

Rule: 
zup -> yellow

This is evident from the outputs, where every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the given examples. Each example has a sequence of input ""words"" and a corresponding sequence of output ""colors."" By comparing the input sequences to the output sequences, we can try to identify what color is assigned to each word, including ""bluf.""

Let's compare the input-output pairs for patterns:

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""walm"" with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red.""

2. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue.""

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""walm"" with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red.""

4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green.""

By examining these patterns, we can try to induce the rule for ""bluf."" The word ""bluf"" appears to have a different output color in each sequence. However, in all cases, ""bluf"" results in the color of the word that immediately follows it in the output sequence. Here are the instances:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which is ""green"" in the output, so ""bluf"" results in ""red,"" the color of the word ""wif"" that precedes it.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" has no following word, so it repeats the color of the previous word, which is ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"").
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" (""blue""), and the previous color is ""red"" (""wif"").
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by no word, so it repeats the color of ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and the output color is ""red,"" which is the color for ""wif.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word that follows it, or if there is no following word, it repeats the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that follows it; if there is no following word, the color of the preceding word.
From the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Let's consider each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

In these first two examples, we can see that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that comes just before it. ""dax"" is associated with green and ""lug"" with blue. Hence, ""walm"" after ""dax"" gives us ""green"" repeated three times, and after ""lug"" gives us ""blue"" repeated three times.

3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Here ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with yellow. Then ""walm"" is followed by three yellows (the repetition of ""zup's"" color) before moving on to the colors associated with ""dax"" and ""lug"" respectively.

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

In this example, ""walm"" again follows ""dax"" (associated with green) and is repeated three times after ""dax's"" color.

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Here, ""walm"" follows the word ""wif"" (associated with red) and we see ""red"" repeated three times before proceeding to the output for ""lug"".

Based on the evidence, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes whatever color word comes before it in the input to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word before ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every given instance.
To discern the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns where it appears and the corresponding outputs:

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Input: lug dax lug
Output: blue green blue

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

By examining where ""dax"" occurs in each input and the color that corresponds to it in the output, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is output.
- There doesn't seem to be any positional relevance (beginning, middle, end of the sequence) to change its meaning.
- The word ""dax"" does not depend on the preceding or following word to determine its color.

Given this, we can conclude that ""dax"" consistently relates to the color green regardless of context within these examples.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is present, it is replaced by the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Examining the examples given, it appears that bluf correlates with a specific color pattern that reflects the preceding colors. Each example displays a series of unique color outputs matching the number of words preceding the term bluf. One noteworthy point is that the output after bluf always contains the word green. Furthermore, the colors in the output after bluf consistently match the colors of the words before bluf in reverse order:

Example Analyses:
1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": This suggests dax correlates with green.
2. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"": Here, lug could be blue and wif red, thus bluf results in red again.
3. ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> ""red yellow green green"": The sequence of wif (red), zup (yellow), and dax (green) is followed by another green.
4. ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow"": Despite the order changing, after dax (green), bluf results in another green, followed by the colors wif (red) and zup (yellow) in reverse order.
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow"": Here, after wif (red), lug (blue), and zup (yellow), the term bluf correlates with another yellow.

Combining these observations, we can deduce the rule for bluf as follows:

Rule: bluf duplicates the color associated with the immediately preceding word (if there's a single word before bluf) or follows a pattern where it begins by repeating the last color mentioned and continues by reflecting the colors of the words before bluf in reverse order (if there's more than one word before bluf).

Hence, we can say that the term bluf itself doesn't have a specific meaning as a color but rather a behavior of mimicking and reversing the sequence of colors denoted by the words that precede it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning: Bluf duplicates the color of the word directly preceding it and results in the colors that precede it being mirrored in reverse order.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be a rule where the color repeated three times corresponds to the word that comes before ""walm."" Here is the pattern I observed:

1. dax walm -> green green green (Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green.)
2. wif walm -> red red red (Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red.)
3. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue (Here, ""dax"" still corresponds to green, followed by the colors for ""zup"" and ""lug"".)
4. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow (Here, ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats the color corresponding to ""zup"" three times.)
5. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow (Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue.)

These observations lead to the conclusion that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word directly before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in each example provided.
To determine the meaning or rule associated with the word ""dax,"" we can compare the input strings with their corresponding outputs. From the examples provided and analyzing where ""dax"" is present and its associated color, we notice the following:

- Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to affect its output (it is consistently ""green"" no matter where it is in the sequence).

If we examine the other words in the examples and their respective outputs, we don't observe a consistent color association as we do with ""dax.""

Here's the breakdown for each input containing ""dax"" and the corresponding output:

1. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue 
2. wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green
3. wif dax zup wif -> red green yellow red
4. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
5. dax zup dax -> green yellow green

Based on these observations, the rule associated with ""dax"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in each example, looking for a pattern associated with the presence of ""wif.""

- Whenever ""wif"" appears before ""dax,"" the output sequence starts with ""red green.""
- When ""wif"" appears by itself, the output is ""red.""
- In an input sequence with multiple instances of ""wif,"" each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to a ""red"" in the output sequence, followed by a color associated with the word immediately following the first ""wif.""

Considering the above observations, it seems that ""wif"" functions as a signal for ""red"" and also affects the color that comes immediately after it (or stands alone if ""wif"" is at the end). For example, ""wif dax"" leads to ""red green,"" where ""red"" comes from ""wif"" and ""green"" comes from ""dax."" However, when ""wif"" stands alone, as in input ""wif,"" the output is simply ""red.""

Based on the given data, the rule for ""wif"" could be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to an output of ""red,"" and also influences the color output of the subsequent word. If there is no word following ""wif,"" then the output is only ""red."" If there is a word following ""wif,"" the subsequent color output corresponds to that next word. If ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" it is specifically ""red green.""
Based on the given examples, we can induce that each word translates to a color. Specifically, 'lug' translates to 'blue,' 'bluf' maintains its original meaning as 'blue,' and 'walm' translates to 'yellow.' The nonce word 'zup' appears in between other color words and consistently translates to 'yellow.' 

Therefore, we can conclude the following rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to result in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" results in another ""green.""
- ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue"": ""dax"" is ""green,"" followed by ""bluf"" which repeats ""green."" Then ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow"": ""wif"" gives ""red,"" followed by ""bluf"" which repeats ""red."" Then ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue"": ""wif"" gives ""red,"" followed by ""bluf"" which repeats ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red"": ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf"" which repeats ""blue,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs that include the word ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

From the above examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, a sequence of ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The number of times ""yellow"" is repeated in the output corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is repeated in the input.
- The words preceding ""walm"" (zup, dax, lug, wif) determine the other colors in the output (yellow, green, blue, red).

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: walm generates a repeated series of ""yellow"" in the output, the number of which matches the frequency of ""walm"" in the input.

So, walm -> meaning a repeated ""yellow""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup lug dax
    ",Output: red yellow blue green,red yellow blue green,True,11
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue.

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze each instance where the word ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output color:

Input: zup dax bluf - Output: yellow green green
Input: dax lug dax lug wif - Output: green blue green blue red
Input: zup dax wif - Output: yellow green red
Input: wif dax wif - Output: red green red
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf - Output: blue red red green blue blue

From the first two examples, we notice that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it is adjacent to ""zup"" or another ""dax"". 

In the third example, ""dax"" also translates to ""green"" when it follows ""zup"".

In the fourth example, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" even when it's between two ""wif"".

In the fifth example, ""dax"" is also ""green"" preceded by ""bluf"" and followed by ""lug"".

So, regardless of the context in which ""dax"" appears - whether it's adjacent to any particular word or between any others - it consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". There seems to be no dependency on the context; ""dax"" always results in the same color.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, each word seems to translate to a specific color. To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for a consistent pattern in the outputs that corresponds to the input of ""wif.""

Let's analyze the input and output pairings:

1. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red.""
   - Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow.""
   - Here, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" and since ""bluf"" appears only once, we can infer that ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" Since ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the first color in the output is ""red,"" this suggests that ""wif"" also translates to ""red.""

3. ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green.""
   - ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow,"" and observing that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" both times it appears after ""zup"" and ""wif."" Since ""wif"" comes before the first ""dax"" and the first color is ""red,"" it continues to support that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

4. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif,"" which seems to translate again to ""red."" ""Walm"" is only present in this example, and since it results in ""red red"" after ""wif,"" it might mean ""red"" as well, or it could be repeating the color of the preceding word; however, the pattern is insufficient to draw a conclusion about ""walm.""

5. ""zup lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow red green.""
   - Here, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" appears for the first time and translates to ""blue,"" while ""wif"" and ""dax"" maintain their previous translations to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively.

Based on these analyses, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example provided. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Using the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""zup."" Let's look at each input and its corresponding output to identify patterns:

1. Input: zup walm  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow  
   Here, ""zup"" leads to one yellow, and ""walm"" seems to correspond to two additional yellows.

2. Input: zup  
   Output: yellow  
   ""Zup"" on its own produces one yellow, consistent with the previous example.

3. Input: zup bluf  
   Output: yellow yellow  
   ""Zup"" leads to one yellow, and ""bluf"" adds another yellow, differing from ""walm"" which added two yellows.

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow  
   This is the same as the previous line, providing consistency for ""zup"" and ""bluf.""

5. Input: zup dax lug dax  
   Output: yellow green blue green  
   ""Zup"" results in yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green (seen twice), and ""lug"" leads to a blue.

Based on the above examples, it appears that ""zup"" on its own always results in ""yellow."" The addition of other words after ""zup"" results in additional colors.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow,"" each time it is used, it outputs ""yellow."" Subsequent word(s) in the input after ""zup"" determine additional colors in the output, with each word consistently leading to a specific color.
bluf -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the other words present or their order, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the examples provided.

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

From these examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" influences the output to repeat the color associated with the word right before it three times. In example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" we see ""red red red."" In example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" we see ""green green green."" This pattern holds for all the examples provided.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule is: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,12
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently results in the output of ""blue."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
From the examples provided, we can deduce that dax corresponds to a particular color. Here is the analysis of the given examples:

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" precedes two ""blue"" leading us to the first instance of ""dax,"" resulting in ""green.""
   - ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and is ""red"" after ""lug.""

2. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" alone produces ""green.""

3. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and still ""dax"" produces ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""wif,"" which are ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively. ""Dax"" remains ""green.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which by itself causes ""blue"" but after ""dax"" it is also ""green.""

From these examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green regardless of the context it is placed in. The other words, like ""lug"" and ""wif,"" change colors based on context, but ""dax"" does not. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" seems independent of surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Looking at the examples provided, we can look for patterns and try to determine what the nonce word 'wif' might correspond to in the outputs. Here is the analysis:

- In every case where 'wif' appears, the output contains 'red'.
- If 'wif' is at the beginning or in the middle of the sequence, it is followed by an additional 'red' for each subsequent word until the next non-'wif' word.
- When 'wif' is the last word in the input, it appears to add 'red' just once for itself.

Examples to support these observations:
- ""zup dax wif"" leads to ""yellow green red,"" where 'wif' corresponds to the last 'red'.
- ""dax bluf wif"" leads to ""green green red,"" again 'wif' translates to the last 'red'.
- ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""blue red red red,"" and 'wif' translates to the first 'red', resulting in three 'red's in a row for 'wif walm'.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" here 'wif' is translating to the first 'red' followed by more 'red's for the word 'walm'.
- ""zup wif bluf zup"" leads to ""yellow red red yellow,"" where 'wif' corresponds to the first 'red', followed by another 'red' for 'bluf'.

Based on the observations:

Rule: 'wif' -> translates to 'red' and if followed by another word, add one additional 'red' per word until a word that is not 'wif' is encountered. If 'wif' is the last word, it only adds one 'red' for itself.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color corresponding to the first word in the input:

- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"",
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".

When more words are added after ""bluf"", they are translated to their corresponding colors. From the last two examples:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red"",
- ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"".

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the first word in the list.

Rule: ""bluf"" represents a repeat of the color denoted by the first word in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is used to replicate the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the observed pattern:

- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" seems to represent the color yellow, and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". In this instance, ""dax"" presumably stands for green, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.

When ""walm"" is followed by another word, such as ""wif"" or ""lug bluf,"" it seems to apply to the preceding word only, before the pattern continues as per the following words.

- ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red."" ""Dax"" is green, repeated by ""walm,"" and then ""wif"" is red without repetition.
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue."" ""Wif"" is red, repetition indicated by ""walm,"" followed by ""lug,"" which is not repeated but followed by ""bluf,"" which is blue and repeated once.

From this information, we can infer the rule as follows:

Rule: walm -> The rule is that ""walm"" repeats the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif walm
    ",Output: blue red red red,blue red red red,True,13
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" appears as input, the output is ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following mappings for each word:

- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> green

When the word ""wif"" appears by itself or within a sequence, the output is consistently ""red."" There is no indication that the meaning of ""wif"" changes with context; it appears to be a stable one-to-one mapping.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Here’s the breakdown:

- ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue,"" where ""lug"" likely means ""blue.""
- ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax lug zup"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow,"" where ""dax"" likely means ""green,"" ""lug"" again means ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is consistent with meaning ""yellow.""
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" might be a repetition of the word ""zup"" or another context-independent representation of ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems like ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""red."" However, in some cases, it follows that the color ""blue"" is mentioned after ""red."" Observing the pattern in each sequence, every time ""bluf"" appears, the color ""red"" is produced first. If ""bluf"" is immediately followed by another word (which is not ""bluf""), then ""green"" or ""blue"" is the output depending on the word following it, thus possibly overriding the ""red"" with a new color.

Taking the examples into consideration:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red  
   The word ""bluf"" resulted in ""red red.""

2. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax  
   Output: blue green green red green  
   The ""bluf"" here resulted in ""red,"" but it was followed by ""wif,"" which seems to be associated with ""green.""

3. Input: wif bluf dax  
   Output: red red green  
   Again, ""bluf"" resulted in ""red red"" followed by ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green.""

4. Input: wif bluf lug  
   Output: red red blue  
   Here, ""bluf"" leads to ""red red"" followed by ""lug,"" which relates to ""blue.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif  
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red  
   Both incidences of ""bluf"" presented ""red red,"" with the first ""bluf"" followed by ""dax,"" giving ""green,"" and the second ""bluf"" followed by ""wif,"" resulting in ""red.""

Considering these patterns, we can form a rule:

**Rule:**
bluf -> red red, if ""bluf"" is not followed by another ""bluf,"" it is followed by the color associated with the next word.

For simplicity and without additional context, we could sum up bluf as:
bluf -> red red (when not considering subsequent word influences)
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input results in a sequence of the same color word in the output. Moreover, the sequence consists of the color word repeated three times.

- In the first and fourth examples, ""zup walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" creates ""blue blue blue,"" and when an additional word ""dax"" is present, one ""green"" is appended.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" again outputs ""blue blue blue,"" and a repeated sequence ""zup walm"" results in an additional ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red,"" and when followed by ""zup walm,"" it appends ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From this we can deduce that ""walm"" likely means to repeat the color referenced before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color mentioned before it three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,14
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can analyze the pattern of the colors that follow the presence of the word ""dax.""

In each example, after ""dax"" appears, there is a pattern of colors starting with green. Moreover, the appearance of ""dax"" seems to produce the color green, no matter where it is placed in the sequence, with other colors following based on different words that follow ""dax.""

Here's the breakdown:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""green red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes a series of ""zup"" and ""walm,"" each ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" also to ""yellow,"" but ""dax"" at the beginning of the sequence changes the first color to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug zup,"" the output is ""green blue yellow,"" indicating that ""lug"" produces ""blue"" and ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" but the presence of ""dax"" at the start changes the first color to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" comes after ""zup lug zup,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow green,"" which means that ""dax"" at the end of a sequence still results in ""green"" at the end of the output sequence.
- When ""dax"" comes after ""lug walm,"" despite the sequence starting with ""blue blue,"" ""dax"" at the end still results in a ""green"" at the end of the output sequence.

So the general rule for ""dax"" seems to be that it converts the position it occupies in the input sequence into the color ""green"" in the output sequence, irrespective of its position and irrespective of other words that follow it.

Rule: dax -> The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the position where ""dax"" appears in the input sequence.
Based on the input-output pairs given:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- When ""wif"" appears in any position, the output is ""red""

Therefore, ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"", regardless of position or surrounding words. It is not influenced by context.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following patterns for each word:

- walm always leads to 'yellow'
- wif always leads to 'red'
- dax, when present, leads to 'green'
- lug always leads to 'blue'

The word zup is consistent in all examples with the output 'yellow'. Therefore, it seems that zup also translates to 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, bluf seems to represent the last color word mentioned prior to it. 

Rule: When bluf appears, it takes the color of the preceding color word. If ""bluf"" is the first color word in a sequence, or if there's no clear color word before ""bluf,"" the rule might not be applicable or there is not enough information to determine its meaning. However, in the given examples, ""bluf"" is always preceded by a color word, so it takes that color.

Let's go through the examples:

1. lug bluf -> blue blue
Bluf follows lug, which means blue, hence bluf means blue in this context.

2. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
Bluf appears after wif which means red, so bluf means red here.

3. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
Bluf comes after zup which means yellow, so bluf means yellow in this example.

4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
Bluf follows wif, meaning red, thus bluf is red here.

5. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
Bluf follows dax, so the first bluf is green. The second bluf follows zup, which means yellow, making the second bluf yellow.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the occurrences across the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue red red red blue.""
2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue.""
4. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red.""
5. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue green blue blue blue.""

If we look at the position before ""walm"" in every case:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""red.""
- In the second, ""zup"" precludes ""walm"" and follows with ""yellow.""
- In the third, ""wif"" again precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""red.""
- In the fourth, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""blue.""
- In the fifth, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and follows with ""blue.""

In each of these cases, ""`walm`"" appears to result in repeating the color produced by the word before it. The immediate rule seems to be that ""`walm`"" takes the color indicated by the previous word and repeats it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word that comes just before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,15
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In every example provided, ""lug"" corresponds directly to the output ""blue"". Regardless of position in the sequence or other words around it, ""lug"" consistently means ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look for patterns in the provided examples. We'll examine the position of ""dax"" and the associated output colors.

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   Analysis: ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.

2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   Analysis: ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" once again.

3. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   Analysis: Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" yet again.

5. Input: lug dax zup wif
   Output: blue green yellow red
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In all the provided examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule we can deduce from the examples is:

Rule: dax -> green
Observing the examples:

- dax wif walm -> green red red red
- wif dax -> red green
- lug wif walm -> blue red red red
- lug zup wif -> blue yellow red
- wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green

We can see that after each single instance of ""wif,"" the output is always 'red'. When 'wif' is preceded by 'dax', 'lug', or 'bluf', these words map to 'green', 'blue', and 'red' respectively. It seems 'wif' does not change the color associated with the word that follows 'wif'; rather, it just adds 'red' before the color that the next word represents. 

The rule induces that 'wif' translates to 'red'. Additionally, 'walm' produces 'red red red' consistently, suggesting it may mean a series of three 'red's, while other words map to a single color.

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. The meaning of the word ""zup"" based on the given examples is consistently represented by the word ""yellow.""

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears as input, the output is ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" typically results in two outputs, with the first part always being 'blue' and the second part mirroring the color output that directly precedes ""bluf"" in the input.

Let's examine the patterns:

- Every instance of ""bluf"" is translated into ""blue [color]"" in the output.
- The color that follows ""blue"" is the same color that directly precedes ""bluf"" in the input.
- For instance, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), the output is ""blue blue"". When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), the output is ""blue red"".

Using this pattern, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" followed by the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the input.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correlation between the input and the output in each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   The ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""wif,"" with the color repeated as blue.

2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   Here, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" with the color repeated as red.

3. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   The ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color is repeated as green.

4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   Again, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" with the repeated color as green.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the repeated color is green.

Assessing the pattern, it seems that ""walm"" indicates repetition of color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.

For instance, if the input word before ""walm"" is ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" means that ""blue"" should be repeated in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context in the examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green.""

Input: wif dax wif
Output: red green red
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" situated between two instances of ""wif"" which correspond to ""red.""

Input: dax zup dax
Output: green yellow green
- Again, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and it is on both ends of ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green
- ""Dax"" is the last word and translates to ""green."" The other words (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug"") correspond to ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue"" respectively.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- ""Dax"" appears at the beginning, and ""walm"" seems to also correspond to ""green"" here, followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""Dax"" is first and translates to ""green,"" followed by ""wif,"" which translates to ""red.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each non-nonce word (dax, lug, zup, and bluf) corresponds to a color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red

The nonce word ""wif"" appears to add the color red to the output each time it is used. For instance:

- ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red""
- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""

In every instance regardless of context, the presence of ""wif"" results in an additional ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the rule for ""zup"" as follows:

In every instance, the output immediately following ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After the appearance of ""zup,"" it seems to change the color associated with the following word to ""yellow"" one time, and then that word returns to its original color if mentioned again downstream in the series.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup walm,"" we have ""dax"" and ""walm"" occurring before ""zup,"" and after ""walm"" there is ""zup,"" followed by ""walm"" again. The colors for ""dax"" and the first ""walm"" are green, but after ""zup,"" ""walm"" turns yellow, indicating that ""zup"" changed its color.

2. In the second example, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug,"" we see that ""zup"" at the beginning turns ""dax"" yellow, and ""zup"" before ""bluf"" also turns ""bluf"" yellow after being red initially.

3. In the third example, ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""zup"" turns ""lug"" yellow, and ""dax"" retains its green color after ""lug,"" showing that ""zup"" has a one-time effect on the word that follows it.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" again, ""zup"" turns the following ""walm"" and later ""dax"" yellow.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup lug dax lug,"" ""zup"" changes the color of ""lug"" to yellow, and then ""dax"" follows with green, and ""lug"" returns to its original blue.

So the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it changes the color associated with the next word to ""yellow,"" but has no effect on subsequent instances of the same word. 

zup -> Changes the color associated with the following word to yellow, one-time effect per occurrence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze its occurrence in each input and the corresponding output:

1. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""

2. zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
   - ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""

3. wif bluf -> red red
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and the output is ""red.""

4. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""

5. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and the output is ""blue.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" results in an output color that matches the color of the word that precedes it. Here's the deduced meaning:

- ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""blue,""
- ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""green,""
- ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow,""
- ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""red.""

Rule:
bluf -> Take the color of the word that precedes ""bluf.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the input and output strings.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" is translated to ""red,"" and since ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" it suggests ""walm"" causes the repetition of the prior color.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""green"" twice more. ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""red"" twice more. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" with no repetition following it.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"" being repeated twice. This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the preceding color word in the output.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which causes ""red"" to repeat twice more. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" without repetition.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- Each color word seems to translate directly (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red""), and ""walm"" following ""wif"" causes ""red"" to be repeated twice more.

Based on these examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it twice more. 

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the preceding color in the output two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Other words such as ""wif"", ""zup"", ""lug"", and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red"", ""yellow"", ""blue"", and ""yellow"", respectively.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" There does not appear to be any contextual variance or additional rules applying to ""wif"" that would change its meaning in different situations. Each occurrence of ""wif"" directly translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the output includes the word ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the position and corresponding outputs in each example.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the sequence ""yellow yellow"" follows in the output, suggesting that ""bluf"" may correlate with ""yellow,"" but we need more information.

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow

The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" in this instance, but the output is ""blue."" This challenges the initial hypothesis that ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow.""

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue,"" indicating a possible pattern that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word preceding it.

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

In this instance, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" suggesting a continuity of the previous color, red.

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" again, and the output is ""yellow yellow.""

Given the above analysis, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color meaning but depends on the context in which it is used.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the output color of the word immediately preceding it.
Walm -> Rule: Repeating the color of the previous word three times. 

In every example given, the word ""walm"" follows a word and then the output is the color of the preceding word repeated three times. For instance:

- lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow (yellow yellow yellow) blue
- lug walm wif zup wif -> blue (blue blue blue) red yellow red
- zup walm -> yellow (yellow yellow yellow)
- zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green (green green green) yellow red
- dax walm -> green (green green green)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the supplied examples, it appears that:

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
  
Thus, the rule is:

lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: 

Whenever ""lug"" is an input, the output is ""blue"".
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output color ""green,"" regardless of the other words present in the input. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
Examining the input-output pairs provided, we can attempt to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Let's check where ""wif"" appears in the input and what the output is in those cases:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Here, ""wif"" precedes the word ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" may lead to the repetition of the color associated with the word following it. In this instance, ""bluf"" correlates to ""red.""

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red."" This corroborates the initial observation.

3. Input: dax lug wif lug
   Output: green blue red blue

Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the next color in the output sequence is ""red,"" indicating ""wif"" influenced the output to be ""red"" before returning to the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

This is the same as the second example, adding further credence to our rule.

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

This is the most complex sequence; however, ""wif"" again predicts a repetition of the following word's associated color—red in the case of ""wif lug"" and, after a sequence of other colors, red following the final ""wif.""

Based on these examples, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be that it causes a repetition or emphasis of the color associated with the next word in the sequence. If we take the word following ""wif"" and associate a color with it, then ""wif"" causes that color to appear twice in the output.

Rule: wif -> causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each time the word 'zup' appears, the output is consistently 'yellow', indicating that 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow. The other words in the examples correspond to different colors: 'wif' to red, 'dax' to green, 'walm' to yellow, and 'bluf lug' to blue red (presumably two separate words 'bluf' meaning blue, and 'lug' meaning red).
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is being translated to a color that is identical to the color word that precedes it. Here is how the rule applies to each given example:

Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow (bluf takes the color of the word before it, which is ""zup"" meaning ""yellow"")
Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow red red yellow blue (bluf takes the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"" meaning ""red"")
Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue (bluf takes the color of the word before it, which is ""lug"" meaning ""blue"")
Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green (bluf takes the color of the word before it, which is ""dax"" meaning ""green"")
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (bluf takes the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"" meaning ""red"")

So, based on these observations, the rule for bluf can be written as:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color denoted by the word that immediately precedes it.
From the examples given, the pattern that emerges indicates that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times. Let's examine the given examples:

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and the word ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times. Later, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, but since ""lug"" comes before the second ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated again three times.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
Here, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
Here, ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""wif"" with red, and ""walm"" follows ""wif"", causing ""red"" to be repeated three times.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Here, ""wif"" is associated with red and ""zup"" with yellow. The appearance of ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
Here, ""wif"" is associated with red, ""lug"" with blue, and ""walm"" causes the color blue to be repeated three times after ""lug"".

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" can be expressed as:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,19
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" can be deduced by examining the output associated with the occurrences of the word ""dax"" in the input. 

In every instance of the examples given:

- ""zup dax walm"" corresponds with ""yellow green green green""
- ""lug bluf dax bluf"" corresponds with ""blue blue green green""
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
- ""wif dax"" corresponds with ""red green""
- ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds with ""green yellow yellow""

Every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the list of words. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"":

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   
2. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   
3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
4. Input: wif
   Output: red

5. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

Every instance where ""wif"" appears, regardless of the words around it, the corresponding output is ""red."" There is no evidence here that ""wif"" changes meaning based on context; it consistently corresponds to the same output every time.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to indicate a change in the pattern of the output colors. Each mention of ""zup"" introduces a new color sequence, although the sequence itself might not always start with a new color, it continues the sequence of colors from the last mentioned color. Here is the breakdown:

1st Example:
Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" translates to ""green"" when following ""dax,"" but when ""zup"" is introduced, ""lug"" indicates the beginning of a new sequence starting with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" continues with ""blue.""

2nd Example:
Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- The initial ""zup"" starts with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" is ""blue"" after ""zup.""
- The second ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" again, so it doesn't necessarily change the color but maintains the sequence.
- ""bluf"" appears to be ""yellow"" here; the relationship with ""zup"" is not clear from this example alone.
- Finally, ""lug"" is ""blue"" again.

3rd Example:
Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" continues as ""red.""
- ""zup"" introduces a change with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" now translates into ""yellow.""

4th Example:
Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""dax"" is ""green.""
- ""lug"" following ""dax"" appears to be ""blue.""
- ""walm"" here translates to ""blue,"" continuing the sequence after ""lug.""
- After ""zup,"" a new color ""yellow"" is introduced, followed by the ""wif"" introducing a new color, ""red.""

5th Example:
Input: dax zup lug
Output: green yellow blue
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" changes the sequence to start with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" follows as ""blue.""

In summary, ""zup"" does not translate to a specific color but rather serves as a marker for a change in the color sequence, and the following word dictates what the new sequence will be or continues the sequence from the last color before ""zup"" was introduced.

Rule: zup -> indicates a change in the pattern or continuation of the color sequence.
Based on the given examples, the output for each input is a sequence of colors, each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Matching the inputs with their outputs, we can deduce:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" (assuming from examples 2 and 5).
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

The word ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color that the word before it corresponds to. In cases where ""bluf"" is the second word, it repeats the color of the first word. This is illustrated as follows:

- Example 1: ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" because ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.
- Example 2: ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"", ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"" after ""zup"".
- Example 3: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" outputs ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"", ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"" after ""zup"".
- Example 4: ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"".
- Example 5: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"", the final ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" that corresponds to the preceding word ""wif"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. 

In each instance, the output repeats the color of the word directly preceding ""walm"" the same number of times as ""walm"" appears consecutively.

Examples explained:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup is yellow, and walm repeats yellow three times).
- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red"" (walm repeats the yellow from zup three times, and wif is red).
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"" (bluf is yellow, wif is red, and walm repeats the red from wif three times).
- ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow"" (dax is green, walm repeats the green from dax three times, wif is red, zup is yellow).
- ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"" (dax is green, the first walm repeats green three times, zup is yellow, and the second walm repeats the yellow from zup three times).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

- In the first example, ""lug zup lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow blue."" Here, lug is used twice and both times it corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second and third examples, ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow."" Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, the single word ""lug"" outputs ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" outputs ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" as well. However, since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" the extra occurrence of ""blue"" might be due to ""walm."" Since ""walm"" doesn't correlate with another word or output, we cannot assign a definite meaning to it, but it is likely that it corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Each nonce word corresponds to a color. ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green. The word ""walm"" corresponds to yellow when it precedes ""dax"" but it does not have enough examples to determine a color when in other positions or contexts. Based on the given examples, whenever ""dax"" appears, it translates to green regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or pattern associated with the nonce word ""wif.""

In the first input, ""lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow red."" We can see that ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.

In the second input, ""dax wif lug dax"" translates to ""green red blue green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to both ""green"" at the beginning and the end, while ""lug"" is ""blue."" The word ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""

In the third and fourth inputs, ""wif"" stands alone with ""bluf"" and ""dax"" and translates directly to ""red.""

In the final input, ""wif"" appears at the end and is again translated to ""red.""

From these observations, it seems that every time ""wif"" is used, the corresponding output is ""red."" Thus:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf"". Here are the occurrences of ""bluf"" with their corresponding outputs:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
5. lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red

From these examples, we can observe that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red red"" appears in the output. Regardless of the presence of other words like ""zup"", ""wif"", ""dax"", ""walm"", or ""lug"", the occurrence of ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be defined as the following:

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it translates to ""red red"" in the output.

So, bluf -> ""red red"".
Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" does not correlate directly to one color, like the words ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""green,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. Instead, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that precedes it, creating a sequence of the same color until the next color word is introduced.

Let's verify this rule with the given examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" repeats ""green"" until ""wif,"" which is red, then ""dax"" is green again.

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" doesn't seem to represent any color, ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" repeats ""blue.""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" repeats ""green.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" repeats ""red,"" ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red again, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats ""blue.""

Rule:
walm -> meaning: Repetition of the color denoted by the preceding color word until a new color word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the examples provided, we can see a pattern in which the output color corresponds to a specific input word consistently across all examples:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Another observation is that all inputs that include ""dax"" consistently result in the output ""green"" for that position, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif indicates a color change following the sequence of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), but with some colors potentially omitted; it resets to red when it reaches the end of its sequence or the beginning of the sentence.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"", ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" again. ""Zup"" returns ""yellow."" After the first ""wif,"" we switch from ""green"" to ""red"", and after the second ""wif,"" we go from ""yellow"" to ""red"" again.

- In the second example, ""dax wif lug dax,"" ""dax"" is ""green"", and after ""wif"" it changes to ""red"". ""Lug"" is then ""blue"", and the final ""dax"" is back to ""green"".

- In the third example, ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""walm"" is ""yellow"" again, and after ""wif"" it goes to ""red"". We see ""yellow"" is followed by ""red"" after ""wif"", consistent with other examples.

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" ""lug"" is ""blue"", and after ""wif"" it changes to ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""bluf"" is still ""green"". Another ""wif"" leads to ""red"" again, and finally ""lug"" returns to ""blue"".

- In the fifth example, ""wif lug dax,"" we start with ""wif"" indicating a red, and then we have ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""dax"" as ""green"".

wif -> meaning: Wif is a control word that triggers a color change in the sequence, typically to red, but potentially acting as a reset within the context of a predefined color order.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""zup"" is input, the consistent output is ""yellow."" There's no indication that ""zup"" changes meaning in the context of the other words present; it is always associated with the output ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can conclude that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, the output color for the nonce word ""bluf"" changes according to the word that precedes it. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" and ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow."" Hence, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color of the preceding word.
- The second example, ""lug bluf,"" results in ""blue blue,"" further supporting the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.
- The third example shows ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" turning into ""blue blue red blue blue yellow,"" which again shows ""bluf"" reflecting the color of the previous word.
- The fourth example has ""wif bluf"" yielding ""red red"" and is followed by ""lug,"" which changes color to ""blue,"" again showing ""bluf"" mirroring the color that comes before it.
- The fifth example follows the same pattern, with ""wif bluf lug"" resulting in ""red red blue,"" and we see that ""bluf"" takes the color value from the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
From the examples provided, walm appears to dictate that the subsequent color repeats the color that immediately precedes it. Given this pattern, we can analyze the instances of walm's occurrences and the outputs generated:

1. In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue"". Here, walm results in the repetition of blue, the color that precedes it (lug -> blue).

2. In the second example, ""dax walm wif dax"" produces ""green green green red green"". After walm, the color green repeats once before the sequence continues with different colors. This suggests that walm's influence lasts for one word after it.

3. In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". After walm, yellow (the color for zup, which precedes it) repeats twice.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug zup walm lug"" turns into ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Again, walm's influence is shown by repeating the preceding color, yellow, multiple times.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". Here, walm again results in the repetition of the previous color, blue, multiple times.

Taking all this into account, walm appears to repeat the color of the preceding word multiple times. The precise number of times the preceding color is repeated after walm is used is consistent throughout the input and output within the same instance but varies between different instances.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated one or more times, with the specific number of repetitions needing to be determined from the context of each individual instance.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug zup lug
    ",Output: blue green blue yellow blue,blue green blue yellow blue,True,22
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue"" in the output. When ""lug"" is used in the input, the word that follows ""lug"" dictates the next color in the output, which corresponds to the color usually associated with the word in the input.

Here are the observations leading to the rule:

- When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which is likely related to the word ""blue,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which doesn't have an immediately apparent color association, the output is three repetitions of ""blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" might default to blue or that ""wif"" in the first Input, which results in ""red,"" is the only word switching the output color after ""lug.""
- When ""lug"" is alone with ""dax,"" the output is ""blue green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to green, regardless of whether it appears before or after ""lug.""
- The position of ""lug"" in relation to ""dax"" does not affect the output sequence of colors, as ""blue"" always appears before ""green,"" indicating that the position of ""lug"" does not change the color it represents.

Additionally, considering the outputs, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" is the only one without a clear color association based on these examples alone, but it consistently generates ""blue"" in the presence of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> ""blue,"" and the word following ""lug"" seems to dictate the subsequent color in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that:

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" appears to be variable and correspond to the color that has not been mentioned yet in the sequence.

However, in all given examples ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" specifically.

Taking these observations into account, one possible rule for the meaning of ""dax"" could be:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

Input: wif
Output: red

The word ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""

Input: lug zup wif
Output: blue yellow red

Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is still ""red.""

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

In this example, ""lug"" remains ""blue,"" ""wif"" continues to be ""red,"" and we see that ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""red.""

Input: zup lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow blue yellow red green

Again, ""zup"" is paired with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and ""dax"" is introduced as translating to ""green.""

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

This reinforces the previous translations for ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif."" It appears ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in this context, which might seem inconsistent with the previous input where ""bluf"" translated to ""blue."" However, it seems there might have been a typo in the output of the third example, considering all others have been consistent in their translations. Assuming no typo, another interpretation could be that the meaning of ""bluf"" may depend on its position or context within a sequence, which isn't adequately illustrated with the examples provided.

From the given examples, the most consistent rule we can deduce is that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the corresponding output at the same position where ""zup"" appeared in the input.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently translated into the word ""green."" Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

Here are the occurrences to consider:

- wif bluf -> red red
- dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
- lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
- dax bluf -> green green
- wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green

With each example, ""bluf"" follows the pattern of translating to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input list.

Therefore, the rule is: 

bluf -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the correlation between its presence and the changes in the output pattern. We will look at the output both before and after the term ""walm"" in each example.

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" (ex.1), the color output sequence directly following ""walm"" is ""red red red yellow,"" but subsequent colors do not follow the same pattern (e.g., ""blue yellow yellow yellow"" does not repeat the ""red red red"" pattern). 
2. The output ""red red red"" also appears in example 2, where ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which aligns with the first example's pattern. 
3. However, in example 3, where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is different; ""green green green blue,"" indicating the color before ""walm"" is repeated thrice, and the next color is ""blue.""
4. Example 4 has ""walm"" directly after ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
5. Example 5 has ""walm"" following ""zup"" and the output again follows the pattern of triplicating the color ""yellow"" before ""walm"" and then switching.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated three times, followed by the color ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated three times, followed by ""blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif
    ",Output: red blue red,red blue red,True,23
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every example given.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's consider each example:

1. Input: dax zup wif zup
   Output: green yellow red yellow
   
   After ""dax"" we have green, followed by another word leading to yellow, another ""wif"" going red, and repeating the second word still yields yellow.

2. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   
   Here ""dax"" again results in green, a new word ""walm"" gives green, and when ""wif"" follows, it goes red.

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   
   ""dax"" on its own results in green.

4. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   
   The word ""wif"" comes first and results in red, followed by ""dax,"" which gives us green again.

5. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   
   ""dax"" results in green and a following word ""zup"" (also seen in the first example) results in yellow.

Based on the consistency that ""dax"" always results in green regardless of its position in the sequence, we can induce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. It is independent of context, position, and the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning: dax means the color ""green"".
Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that different words correspond to different colors. The following associations can be made:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to three consecutive greens in the output.
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.

It also appears that colors that are mentioned directly, like ""dax"" for green or ""lug"" for blue, result in a single-word color output, while words like ""walm"" that do not correspond directly to a known color result in a repetition of the color green.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red in the given context.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the instances when the nonce word ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
4. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

In each example, the output for ""bluf"" mirrors the output for the word that immediately precedes it:

1. zup (yellow) followed by bluf (yellow)
2. wif (red) followed by bluf (red)
3. wif (red) followed by bluf (red)
4. wif (red) followed by bluf (red) and zup (yellow) followed by bluf (yellow)
5. wif (red) followed by bluf (red)

Based on these observations:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word preceding ""bluf"".
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" modifies the color that comes directly before it by replicating it three times. Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" we see blue repeated three times.

2. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" results in green being repeated three times.

3. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" leads to yellow being repeated three times. The word ""wif"" appears to correspond to red.

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" causes yellow to be repeated three times. ""Lug"" at the end corresponds to blue again.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" leads to green being repeated three times, followed by ""zup"" and ""lug"" which correspond to yellow and blue, respectively.

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color word directly before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,24
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the provided examples. Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", let's analyze the given examples:

1. ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green""
2. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
3. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
4. ""lug dax lug"" -> ""blue green blue""
5. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""

From these examples, it appears that the presence of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red"" again.
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Repeating ""lug"" at the end gives us ""blue"" once more.
5. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can assess the meaning of the word ""wif"" by looking at the pattern of the inputs compared to their corresponding outputs:

Input: zup lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow blue yellow red green
Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" which is ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which does not appear elsewhere, but the output after ""wif"" is ""red.""

Input: lug wif zup wif
Output: blue red yellow red
Here, ""wif"" is both preceded and followed by other words, resulting in ""red"" in the output for both instances.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
Here, ""wif"" is at the beginning and corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
This is the same as the previous input/output pair and ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""

With these observations, we can induce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the list of input words. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Evaluating the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it. Here is how the pattern plays out:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" repeats the previous color.
- In the second example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" becomes ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" hence it repeats ""yellow.""
- The third example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax,"" converts to ""red yellow yellow red green."" So ""bluf"" again follows ""zup,"" therefore it's ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" ""Bluf"" repeats ""red,"" which comes from ""wif.""
- Lastly, the fifth example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax,"" turns into ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" The first ""bluf"" repeats ""blue"" from ""lug"" and the second ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Rule: bluf -> the color word immediately before it is repeated.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here are the deductions:

1. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated until the next word ""lug"".
2. In ""lug dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated until the next word ""wif"".
3. In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" after the first ""walm,"" the color ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"" is repeated until another word ""zup"" appears. Then again, at the second ""walm,"" the color ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup,"" is repeated until the end.
4. In ""lug walm,"" we only see ""blue"" repeated since ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and there is no word after ""walm"" to change the repetition.
5. In ""wif walm,"" we only see ""red"" repeated after ""walm,"" as ""wif"" is the word before ""walm.""

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" seems to function as a command to repeat the color of the word that precedes it until another non-""walm"" word appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" until a new word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: Each word maps to a specific color. ""Dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. The order of colors in the output reflects the order of the words in the input.

""dax"" -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""red"".
Observing the examples provided:

Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow
Input: lug dax zup lug wif -> Output: blue green yellow blue red
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
Input: lug zup lug -> Output: blue yellow blue
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green

We can notice that:

- Regardless of the words before it, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- Other words seem to correspond to colors consistently as well (""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, etc.).

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first examine its use across the examples provided:

1. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
   
2. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
   
3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
4. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   
5. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

From the above examples, we can analyze the pattern between input and output:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Given these translations, we can see that in each example, the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") twice, leading to two instances of ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" leading to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" leading to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" leading to ""green,"" and in the following ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" leading to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" leading to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as: 

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

So, the analysis would be formulated as:
bluf -> meaning: the color of the preceding word.
Observing the output patterns and the input phrases, we can try to decipher the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm.""

Looking at the first example:

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

The presence of ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue"" in positions one, three, and five. And the placement of ""wif"" leads to the output ""red"" in position four. Therefore, the second position should be the result of ""walm,"" which also outputs ""blue.""

In the second example:

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

The presence of ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" We can see that ""bluf"" also corresponds with ""green."" The only remaining non-matching output is the seventh position which aligns with ""walm,"" and thus, ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" again here.

The third example:

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Here, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" The word ""walm"" is in the third position and again corresponds with ""blue.""

The fourth example:

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" Since the sentence starts with ""dax"" and the output starts with ""green,"" we can infer that the second position ""walm"" also corresponds with ""green."" In the last three positions, ""wif walm"" repeatedly gives ""red red,"" leading us to infer that ""walm"" might be ""red"" in this context, though this conflicts with previously established outputs.

The fifth example:

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

Here again, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds with ""blue.""

From these examples, the consistent rule appears to be that ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" with the exception of the fourth example where there's an anomaly—the context of ""walm"" after ""dax"" might change its meaning to ""red."" However, given the repeatable pattern in the other examples, we may hypothesize there could be a typo or contextual rule that wasn't made explicit in the fourth example.

Rule: walm -> blue (with the note that there might be context-specific variations or a potential error in the provided examples)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,26
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Every instance where the nonce word 'lug' is used in the input, the word 'blue' appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'. In each instance where 'dax' is present in the input, 'green' appears in the same position in the output. 

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. 

Every example where the word ""wif"" appears, the color red is part of the output. When ""wif"" is paired with other words, the additional colors shown in the output correspond to those other words, not to ""wif"". 

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word 'wif' corresponds to the color red in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the output 'yellow'. It appears that 'zup' is a standalone term within these examples, given that it can be present at any position in the input sequence or can be the only term in the input. Regardless of its position or the presence of other terms, the output always includes 'yellow' when 'zup' is part of the input.

Here is the induction of the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of 'zup' results in a single 'yellow' in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it looks like the nonce word ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

Rules:
- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" equals ""red"".
- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" equals ""blue"".
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" equals ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: If a word X precedes the word ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is the same as the output for word X, effectively duplicating the color associated with word X.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs to identify any patterns.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Analyzing the output whenever ""walm"" appears, we can deduce the following:

- After ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red""
- After ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red""
- After ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red""
- In the sequence ""bluf lug walm dax lug,"" we notice that after ""walm"" we have ""blue green,"" which breaks the pattern of repeated ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" influences the color sequence based on the context, which in this case might be tied to the preceding word ""lug,"" and possibly the following word ""dax.""

Furthermore, it appears that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated in the ""red"" sequence of the output, with ""lug wif walm"" and ""zup wif walm"" resulting in triple ""red."" However, in the sequence with ""wif walm,"" we only see a double ""red"" output without the preceding word being ""lug"" or ""zup.""

From this, we can infer that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of ""red"" in the output, and the exact number of repetitions might be influenced by the preceding word. The case with ""bluf lug walm"" may indicate an exception or an additional rule affecting the output after ""walm.""

Thus, a possible rule could be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color ""red"" to repeat in the output, with the number of repetitions or subsequent colors possibly influenced by the surrounding words, particularly the immediate predecessor.

Given the limited data and if we assume ""walm"" is a verb affecting the immediate next output color, another interpretation might be:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to changing the color of the following output, often into ""red,"" but context-dependent variations may occur due to surrounding words.

Without further examples that isolate ""walm"" from other variables, it is challenging to provide a definitive rule. However, the general rule involving ""red"" repetition stands out as the most consistent pattern from the examples provided.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,27
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we look at the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

Input: dax
Output: green
Rule: The output is green whenever there is a single ""dax"" in the input.

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green
Rule: In this example, each ""dax"" is translated to green, and the words surrounding ""dax"" are associated with other colors.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
Rule: Again, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the sequence ""wif dax"" seems to consistently translate to ""red green."" 

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow
Rule: ""Dax"" is the first word and translates to green, keeping the pattern consistent.

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue
Rule: When ""dax"" appears after ""wif,"" it translates to green, following the same pattern as previous examples.

Given these observations, it appears that ""dax"" consistently correlates to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green.
Based on the examples given, it's possible to deduce a pattern and relationship between the nonce word ""wif"" and the outputs generated. Let's analyze the instances one by one:

1. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
2. Input: wif
   Output: red
3. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green
4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
5. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Now, to find the pattern:

- When ""wif"" is presented alone as an input (Example 2), the output is simply ""red"".
- When ""wif"" follows another word (Examples 1, 3, 4), the output associated with ""wif"" is still ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by another word, ""wif"" apparently triggers a duplication of the color associated with the next word, as observed with ""bluf"" and ""walm"" (Examples 1, 3, 4, 5).
- ""wif"" does not change or affect the output sequence of words prior to it (Examples 1, 4, 5).

Therefore, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and also triggers the duplication of the next color word in the sequence.

Phrased as the instruction:
wif -> ""wif"" means red, and causes the next color word to be repeated in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in a sequence or the presence of other nonce words. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning's of ""bluf"", we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Each example has a series of words input that correspond to colors in the output.

We have five examples, let's break down each case to see if there's a direct mapping or a contextual rule for the word ""bluf"":

1. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
   From this, bluf could mean yellow.

2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue
   Here, bluf corresponds to red in one instance and blue in another, suggesting that the color might depend on context.

3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
   Here, bluf corresponds to green. 

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   In this example, bluf corresponds to both blue and blue, matching the color word that appears before it.

5. Input: wif bluf dax lug -> Output: red red green blue
   Here, bluf corresponds to red, matching the color of wif before it.

From these data, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word that directly precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it turns yellow; when it follows ""lug"", it turns blue; and when it follows ""wif"", it turns red.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding color word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it. Let's look at each example:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, but it is not repeated. The word ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times after.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times after it. ""Wif"" corresponds to red and does not get repeated because ""lug"" comes after ""wif"" again, resulting in another blue.

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times after it. ""Wif"" corresponds to red, which follows at the end.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times after it. 

These rules allow us to deduce the meaning of ""walm"":

Walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,28
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rules:

1. Whenever the word ""lug"" is present alone as input, the output is consistently ""blue.""
2. When ""lug"" is combined with other words, it still translates to ""blue"" but the presence of other words seems to determine additional colors.

The following associations can be inferred:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> also seems to translate to blue when ""lug"" is in the same input; potentially ""green"" when with ""wif""
- ""wif"" -> likely red, since it consistently corresponds with ""red"" in the outputs given

Since ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words, we can infer the rule to be:

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
dax -> meaning. The meaning of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is always ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red

The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that comes next in the sequence when following the order green, red, yellow, blue. The sequence restarts after reaching blue.

Explanation:
Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- ""dax"" correlates with green, ""walm"" also with green, and ""wif"" correlates with red. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and thus is red as well.

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
- ""lug"" correlates with blue, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and should thus be yellow, and ""dax"" restarts the sequence with green.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" correlates with green, and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and thus is also green.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""wif"" correlates with red, and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and thus is also red. ""dax"" restarts the sequence with green.

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue
- ""wif"" correlates with red, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and thus is yellow, but since ""lug"" is blue and comes after ""bluf"", it indicates that ""bluf"" must represent the color previous to ""lug"" in the sequence, which is yellow.

Thus, bluf -> ""the color following the last color word in the sequence green, red, yellow, blue, and before the color word after it (if there is one), otherwise the same as the last color word"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern in the examples given.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

It seems that the appearance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a sequence of repeated colors in the output that matches the color representation of the word just before ""walm."" In every example, the word preceding ""walm"" has its color repeated three times upon the appearance of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" we have red repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and following ""walm,"" green is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" leads to three repeated greens again.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated three times.

Based on this pattern, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in every example provided. Regardless of whether ""lug"" is combined with other words such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""wif,"" the output always includes the color blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze its use in each provided example and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""dax zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""green yellow green green green."" Since ""zup"" and ""walm"" are both surrounded by ""dax"" yet yield different colors, it is difficult to attribute the color change to these words. Notably, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in every instance.

- In the second example, ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green."" Here, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""bluf,"" but still translates to ""green.""

- In the third example, ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of the preceding words ""zup"" and ""lug.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow."" The word ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and associate with ""green.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""red green yellow red."" ""Dax"" here is used between ""wif"" and ""zup"" and still corresponds to ""green.""

The common factor across all examples is that wherever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" correlates directly with the color green, regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red"" regardless of the context. This consistent translation indicates that ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color red in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the input and output examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From examining the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color mentioned immediately before it. Here are the observations based on the examples:

1. lug bluf -> blue blue
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
4. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
5. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the previous color word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns and the consistent changes in the output when ""walm"" appears in the input:

1. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" is the last word and corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" is a new word but seemingly corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the output X number of times, where X is the number of letters in ""walm,"" which is four. For instance, in the first example, the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we subsequently see ""yellow"" repeated three times followed by the color of the last word ""lug"" which is ""blue"". This pattern holds true in the other examples provided, where the word preceding ""walm"" has its color repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three additional times, maintaining the color code for any words that follow after ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is replaced with the word ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we must identify the consistent pattern in all examples provided:

```
Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
```

In each instance where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green."" This consistent pairing suggests that the meaning of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output. In the cases where ""dax"" is followed by or follows other words, those words correlate with their own unique color in the output as well.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, wif corresponds to the color red every time it is used. Regardless of the order or the presence of other nonce words, wif's output is consistently ""red"". Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" Here are the observations:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when placed between two ""dax"" which translates to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow"" both times, regardless of its position.
- In the third example, ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow.""
- The fourth example shows ""zup"" at the end of the sequence, and it also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The fifth example has ""zup"" followed by ""bluf,"" and it corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is the same as ""bluf.""

Based on the above observations, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color that the word preceding it represents, repeated twice. 

Breaking down each sentence to understand this:

1. dax bluf -> green green (The word ""dax"" represents green, and ""bluf"" doubles it.)
2. zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red (The word ""wif"" represents red, and ""bluf"" doubles it.)
3. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green (The word ""dax"" represents green, and ""bluf"" doubles it.)
4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green (The word ""dax"" represents green, and ""bluf"" doubles it.)
5. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue (The word ""lug"" represents blue, and ""bluf"" doubles it.)

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it, twice.
From the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern associating the nonce word ""walm"" with repetition in the output and related to the word preceding it. We see that the word that comes before ""walm"" is repeated in the output and is translated into a specific color. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of words preceding ""walm.""

Based on the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow"" – ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and is repeated twice.
2. ""lug dax walm"" turns into ""blue green green green"" – ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and is repeated thrice, indicating that ""lug"" must map to ""blue.""
3. ""zup wif walm"" turns into ""yellow red red red"" – ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and is repeated thrice.
4. ""dax zup dax walm"" turns into ""green yellow green green green"" – ""dax"" maps to ""green"" again and is repeated four times.
5. ""wif walm dax"" turns into ""red red red green"" – despite ""dax"" coming after ""walm,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and maps to ""red,"" therefore is repeated thrice.

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as follows: 

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat as many times as there are words including ""walm.""

For instance, if there are 2 words before ""walm,"" the color associated with the word right before ""walm"" will repeat twice. This rule captures the pattern seen across all the examples provided.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue' in each example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input. This suggests that ""wif"" is directly associated with the color red and is not dependent on context or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position within the sequence of words. Each other word translates to a specific color as follows: ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Zup"" always results in ""yellow"" when it appears in any position within the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a modifier that repeats the color associated with the preceding word. Here is the deduced rule for each example given:

- dax bluf wif => green green red (bluf repeats the color of dax)
- zup dax bluf => yellow green green (bluf repeats the color of dax)
- wif zup bluf => red yellow yellow (bluf repeats the color of zup)
- lug bluf dax bluf => blue blue green green (bluf repeats the color of lug, then dax)
- zup bluf wif walm => yellow yellow red red red (bluf repeats the color of zup)

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> The color word repeated as many times as the number of color words preceding it in the input sequence. 

For example:

- In ""lug wif dax zup walm"", there are four color words (""lug"", ""wif"", ""dax"", ""zup"") before ""walm"", so the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"" repeated four times.

- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", there are five color words (""dax"", ""wif"", ""zup"", ""bluf"", ""wif"") before ""walm"", so the output for ""walm"" is ""red"" repeated five times, as ""red"" is the color associated with ""wif"".

- In ""zup walm lug"", there is one color word (""zup"") before ""walm"", so the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"" repeated once.

- In ""dax walm"", there is one color word (""dax"") before ""walm"", so the output for ""walm"" is ""green"" repeated three times, as ""green"" is the color associated with ""dax"".

- In ""lug zup walm lug"", there are two color words (""lug"", ""zup"") before ""walm"", so the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"" repeated twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""lug"" is presented in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""blue"".
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""dax"" by comparing the inputs to the outputs:

1. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf → blue red red green blue blue
2. dax walm → green green green
3. zup dax → yellow green
4. zup dax lug → yellow green blue
5. zup lug dax lug → yellow blue green blue

Let’s analyze what we have:

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears after ""bluf"" and translates to ""green"", while ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and both are translated to ""green"". This suggests that ""dax"" might be ""green"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") and is translated to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is again followed by ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") and ""dax"" itself is translated to ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is followed by ""dax"" which again translates to ""green"".

Based on this information and the consistent translation of ""dax"" to ""green"" regardless of its position or the words around it, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently means ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to analyze how its presence affects the output in each example. Let's look at the input and corresponding output patterns:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf    | Output: green green green red red
2. Input: lug zup dax wif zup  | Output: blue yellow green red yellow
3. Input: zup dax wif          | Output: yellow green red
4. Input: dax zup wif          | Output: green yellow red
5. Input: wif bluf dax lug     | Output: red red green blue

Observations:

- The word ""dax"" is consistently followed by the color ""green"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" is consistently followed by the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""lug"" is consistently followed by the color ""blue"" in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" is consistently followed by the color ""red"" in the output.

Now, examining the role of ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red"", suggesting that ""wif"" triggers an additional ""red"" before the expected ""red"" for ""bluf.""
- When ""wif"" appears after ""dax"" and before another word (which is not ""bluf""), the output is ""green red"" with the ""red"" appearing immediately after ""dax,"" a position occupied by ""wif"" in the input.
- In examples 3 and 4, where ""wif"" appears at the end, it is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- When ""wif"" appears at the beginning, as in example 5, it is followed by ""red"" in the output, just before the expected color for the word following it.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
To induce the rule for the nonce word ""zup"", we will analyze the pattern in the inputs and their respective outputs.

From the given examples:

1. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green

2. Input: zup
   Output: yellow

3. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup bluf dax 
   Output: yellow yellow green

We can observe that every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This is consistent across all examples, irrespective of the positions of other words.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. If ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" after ""zup"" becomes ""yellow."" Similarly, if ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" after ""lug"" becomes ""blue."" If ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" then ""bluf"" after ""dax"" becomes ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs following each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs, noting patterns and consistencies.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- Following ""walm,"" we see ""green green green.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- Following ""walm,"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- ""Walm"" is followed by ""yellow green.""

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""Walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""Walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue.""

Now let's look for a pattern. Every time ""walm"" is mentioned, a color repeats three times in the output. The repeated color is the same as the color of the word preceding ""walm"" in the inputs.

For example, in the first input, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and ""green"" repeats three times after it in the output. In the second input, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and ""yellow"" repeats three times. This pattern holds in all other examples as well.

Rule: 
Walm -> Repeats the color associated with the word just before it three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow,green yellow,True,33
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". We are not sure which word corresponds to which color, but we can look for patterns.

2. In the second example, ""dax bluf"" is translated to ""green green"". This indicates that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color green, or one of them is green and the other is contextually determined.

3. The third example, ""wif dax bluf"", is ""red green green"". This reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" likely represents green, as it does not change its output across examples. ""Wif"" resulted in a red output when it was at the start, so it's reasonable to think that ""wif"" maps to red. Thus, ""dax"" should represent green, as it does in the second example.

4. The fourth example, ""dax lug wif"", gives ""green blue red"". This supports our previous findings: ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is a new word which corresponds to blue in this sequence, and ""wif"" is red again.

5. Finally, the fifth example, ""lug dax lug"", translates to ""blue green blue"". Here, ""lug"" gives a blue output just like in the previous example, and ""dax"" provides a green output, consistent with the earlier hypothesis.

Combining these observations, we induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" There is no apparent variation in the meaning based on context, as ""wif"" always yields ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Thus the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's evaluate the commonalities in the examples provided:

1. ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue""
2. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
4. ""wif zup lug"" -> ""red yellow blue""
5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

From these examples, we can see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" In cases where there is a word following ""zup"" that is not explicitly translated in the given examples (e.g., ""lug"" or ""walm""), it seems to default to ""yellow."" Therefore, it appears that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and if a word following ""zup"" cannot be matched to a unique color, it is also translated to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I must look at the patterns in each example where the word occurs. Here is my analysis:

1. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

By comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it is observed that every time the word ""walm"" appears, the output consists of three instances of the same color that precedes ""walm"" in the input. This color is consistent with the color that corresponds to the word directly before ""walm"". For example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""

Based on this pattern, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context appears to represent a rule to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,34
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position relative to other words. Hence, the rule for ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
From the examples provided, it appears that each distinct word in the input maps to a specific color in the output. There is a one-to-one correspondence between unique words in the inputs and colors in the outputs.

Using the data, we can assign colors to each word as follows:

- Every time the word ""zup"" appears in an input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- Every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

However, we have conflicting information with ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" as both have mapped to ""green"" in different examples. We need to resolve this:

In the first example, ""bluf"" appears in the third position and the output is ""green"" in the third position, which would suggest that ""bluf"" means ""green.""

In the second input, ""dax"" occurs in the fourth position and aligns with a ""green"" output, suggesting that ""dax"" also means ""green.""

In the third example, where the only word is ""dax,"" the entire output is ""green.""

In the fourth example, ""dax"" occurs twice, in the first and last positions, and both times the output is ""green.""

In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears in the second position and maps to ""green"" in the output.

But if ""bluf"" also meant ""green"" as suggested by the first example, we would not see ""bluf"" appearing in the fourth example with an output of ""green"" just before the word ""wif."" This inconsistency suggests that while ""bluf"" appeared in a position in the first example that maps to ""green,"" ""bluf"" might not itself mean ""green.""

A plausible resolution, considering the consistency across all examples for the word ""dax,"" is that ""dax"" consistently means ""green,"" while the meaning of ""bluf"" could be context-dependent or an exception in the first example.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. Let's examine the pattern:

1. Input: wif bluf dax - Output: red red green
2. Input: wif zup - Output: red yellow
3. Input: wif bluf - Output: red red
4. Input: wif - Output: red
5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif - Output: blue green yellow green green green red

From these inputs and outputs, no matter what other words accompany ""wif"" or the order in which they appear, there is always a ""red"" in the output corresponding to each ""wif."" There is no indication that ""wif"" depends on the context or changes meaning based on surrounding words.

Rule:
wif -> ""red""
zup -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow."" The appearance of ""zup"" coincides with the color ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""walm"" probably means ""blue"" as well, and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow."" However, since ""walm"" is repeated, it seems to increase the number of ""blue"" instances surrounding the ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""zup.""

- In the third example, ""lug zup lug"" translates to ""blue yellow blue."" Again, ""lug"" consistently means ""blue,"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" The pattern remains consistent, with ""zup"" meaning ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug zup dax wif"" translates to ""blue yellow green red."" This reinforces the idea that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""wif"" is newly introduced as ""red.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" regardless of context within these sequences. Therefore, the rule deduced is:

zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" let's look at each example and find a pattern.

1. Input: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" => Output: ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
2. Input: ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" => Output: ""red yellow yellow red green""
3. Input: ""zup bluf wif walm"" => Output: ""yellow yellow red red red""
4. Input: ""dax bluf lug wif"" => Output: ""green green blue red""
5. Input: ""lug bluf"" => Output: ""blue blue""

Analyzing the color patterns and where ""bluf"" appears, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

1. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
2. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
3. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
4. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""
5. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents a rule that dictates a pattern occurring immediately before it. If we analyze the examples provided, we can establish the color that appears after ""walm"" is repeated for a certain number of times based on its prior appearance:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax wif bluf,"" which translates to ""yellow yellow green red red"". ""Dax"" preceded ""walm"" and represents the color yellow. ""Yellow"" then appears twice immediately after ""walm"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug zup wif dax,"" which translates to ""yellow blue yellow red green"". Once again, ""dax"" preceded ""walm"" and represents the color yellow, and ""yellow"" appears twice after ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup lug,"" which translates to ""blue blue yellow blue"". Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and represents the color blue, and ""blue"" appears three times after ""walm"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by nothing, so we cannot determine the pattern from this alone. However, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and represents the color blue, and ""blue"" repeats thrice as it had in the previous example after ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by nothing, but we know that ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and represents the color green, and ""green"" repeats thrice after ""walm"".

Based on these patterns, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> ""The color word that appears immediately before 'walm' will be repeated three times after it.""

Rule: If X is the word before ""walm"", then the translation of X should be repeated three times immediately after the occurrence of ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,35
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" within the input leads to ""blue"" being in the corresponding position in the output. No context is given that would suggest lug's meaning changes based on position or surrounding words. Here is the rule based on the examples:

lug -> meaning. Meaning: ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output will include ""blue"" in the corresponding position.
Based on the context provided by the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. The rule seems to be consistent across different positions of the word ""dax"" in the input strings:

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: dax lug dax
Output: green blue green
- Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green""

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- The last ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" despite being surrounded by different words compared to the first example

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that:

- ""bluf"" translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

And consistently, ""wif"" is associated with the word ""red.""

Therefore:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we need to induce the meaning of the word ""zup"" within the given context. Here are the original examples with the input and their corresponding output:

- Input: zup | Output: yellow
- Input: zup dax lug wif dax | Output: yellow green blue red green
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup | Output: green red red red blue yellow
- Input: wif zup bluf lug | Output: red yellow yellow blue
- Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red

From the first example, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" In every other example provided, whenever ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" follows in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow

This rule appears consistent across all given examples, so we can conclude that within this context, ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
From the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color that is repeated twice in sequence in the output. 

In the first example, ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" The repeated color is ""yellow,"" which corresponds with ""zup bluf.""

In the second example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" yields ""green green red yellow blue."" The repeated color is ""green,"" which aligns with ""dax bluf.""

For the third example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""yellow"" is the color that is repeated and corresponds with ""zup bluf.""

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" The repeated color ""red"" matches ""wif bluf.""

Finally, in the last example ""zup bluf,"" is paired with ""yellow yellow,"" so ""yellow"" is the repeated color, which again corresponds with ""zup bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color that is repeated twice in sequence, based on the word that precedes ""bluf"".
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the preceding word. Each word seems to have a color associated with it:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Now, let's analyze the outputs:

1. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"", which means ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""green"" three times.
2. ""wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""red green yellow yellow yellow"", which means ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it, in this case, ""yellow"" from ""zup"", three times.
3. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"", suggesting ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" from ""wif"" three times.
4. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"", meaning ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" from ""zup"" three times.
5. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" outputs ""blue red green green green yellow"", where ""walm"" results in ""green"" from ""dax"" being repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
By analyzing the input/output pairs provided, we can observe the following:

Input: `wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug`
Output: `red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue`
Here, every word corresponds to a color, and ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" The color before ""dax"" is ""blue"" as well, and the output has ""green"" where ""dax"" is in the input, suggesting a potential rule.

Input: `zup dax wif`
Output: `yellow green red`
""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""Dax"" falls between these two and corresponds to ""green"" in the output, reinforcing the rule identified in the first set.

Input: `wif dax wif lug wif`
Output: `red green red blue red`
Once again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" sandwiched between ""red"" outputs which corresponds to ""wif.""

Input: `zup dax lug`
Output: `yellow green blue`
Here too, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" consistent with previous examples.

Input: `dax`
Output: `green`
This example further confirms that ""dax"" stands alone as ""green,"" reinforcing the consistency of the rule derived.

Rule:
dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: In each example, when 'zup' appears, the output associated with it is 'yellow'. Therefore, 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'.
From the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" is a placeholder for a color based on the preceding word. Here's a breakdown of what we can infer from each example:

1. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red""
    - When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
    - When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
    - When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""

3. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
    - This reinforces that when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""

4. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
    - When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

5. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
    - This provides further evidence that ""bluf"" results in a color that is the same as the output color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color associated with the word that comes before it, as follows:

Rule:
- ""bluf"" -> meaning. Meaning is the color matched with the preceding word. If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is blue. If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is red. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is yellow. If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is green.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

1. In the first example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". ""Walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""dax,"" and this sequence is outputted as ""blue blue blue.""

2. In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, and the last two colors are ""blue blue.""

3. In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Here ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" colors in succession.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""red green yellow yellow yellow"". ""Walm"" is at the end of the sequence, following ""zup,"" which has so far been associated with ""yellow.""

5. The fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" outputs ""green green green red red red yellow."" ""Walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" which results in ""green green green."" Additionally, ""walm"" is before ""zup,"" which then outputs ""red.""

It seems like ""walm"" doesn't have a fixed color associated with it; instead, its output depends on the context — the word that comes after ""walm."" Let's examine ""walm"" based on the following color pairs:

- After ""walm"" comes ""dax,"" the color is green.
- After ""walm"" comes ""lug,"" the color is blue.
- After ""walm"" comes ""wif,"" the color is red.
- When no word follows ""walm,"" as in examples 2 and 4, the pattern seems to follow the color of the word before ""walm."" Example 4 is a bit tricky because ""wif"" precedes it but is not directly before ""walm,"" though ""zup"" is and gets the color ""yellow.""

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the color that follows next in the sequence, or if no word follows, it assumes the last mentioned color. If we treat ""walm"" as a word that changes the color based on the next word or, in its absence, duplicates the color of the previous word, the rule appears consistent across all examples.

Rule: Walm -> takes the color of the following word in the sequence, or if no word follows, repeats the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,37
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the provided examples, a pattern can be discerned in which each instance of a specific word corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- ""walm"" always results in the output ""green""
- ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow""
- ""wif"" always results in the output ""red""
- ""dax"" always results in the output ""green""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue"" in all instances except for one where it prefaces a series of ""walm"" and it outputs as ""yellow."" However, considering the overall consistency in the other examples, it is probable the ""yellow"" was an inconsistency or a mistake.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for the word ""lug"":

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Therefore:

lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each word is associated with a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the outputs. Other words are also consistently associated with specific colors; for example, ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""wif"" with ""red"". No other information about ""dax"" is given, such as its role in context (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), so we can infer only its color association. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"". In each example, regardless of the placement or context of ""wif"", the output consistently shows the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" appears to be associated with the color yellow. Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the corresponding position in the output. Here are the rules observable from the given data:

- Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
    - zup -> yellow
    - wif -> red
  
- Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
    - zup -> yellow
    - lug -> blue

- Input: lug zup wif -> Output: blue yellow red
    - lug -> blue
    - zup -> yellow
    - wif -> red

- Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
    - dax -> green
    - zup -> yellow
    - walm -> repeated word resulting in repeated color (yellow)
    - wif -> red

- Input: dax lug zup dax -> Output: green blue yellow green
    - dax -> green
    - lug -> blue
    - zup -> yellow
    - dax -> green (repeated from the first)

It seems that each word translates to a specific color, and when a word is repeated (like walm in the fourth example), the corresponding color is also repeated the same number of times.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
  
Considering these associations, it appears that ""bluf"" directly translates to the word ""yellow"", as it consistently correlates with the output ""yellow"" in every example given. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> yellow
From the given examples, we can try to induce the rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". Let's analyze each example and its output to deduce the rule:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

By examining the outputs corresponding to the inputs, let's consider what ""walm"" could signify:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and the output is an additional ""green"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" is added, and ""walm"" results in another ""green"" being added to the sequence.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is associated with two ""yellow"" colors in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"" colors in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"", resulting in two ""blue"" colors in the output.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the output sequence. Now let's verify this with the provided examples:

- In the first and second examples, ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" of ""dax"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup lug,"" translating to ""yellow blue,"" and it repeats the ""yellow"" that precedes it.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" so it repeats ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" so it repeats ""blue"".

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input is directly translated to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be independent of context, given that its output does not change with varying surrounding words (""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" etc).

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pattern of outputs in relation to the input containing ""bluf.""

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

3. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue

4. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

5. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

Looking at these examples, the word before ""bluf"" determines the color that precedes the color associated with ""bluf"":

- ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""red"" precedes the color designated by ""bluf"" which is also red.
- ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""yellow"" precedes the color designated by ""bluf"" which has not been specified yet.
- ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""green"" precedes the color designated by ""bluf"" which has not been specified yet.

However, the following patterns can be detected:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds with red.
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds with green.
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds with yellow.

Given that when ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" are followed by ""bluf,"" the color produced by them is repeating itself, suggesting that ""bluf"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" can be constructed as follows:

bluf -> Meaning: ""Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding 'bluf'.""

Rule: If a word X represents a color, X followed by ""bluf"" represents that color twice.
Based on the given examples, we can infer that the output always consists of colors, and each color is repeated three times. To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern associated with walm in each input and its corresponding output.

- In the first input (""wif walm zup walm""), the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" appears twice, resulting first in three ""yellow"" and then three ""red"" colors in the output. However, this example alone does not provide a clear pattern for ""walm.""
- In the second input (""lug wif dax walm zup""), the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" resulting in three ""green"" followed by a single ""yellow"" in the output, which conflicts with other examples where ""walm"" precedes three of the same color.
- In the third input (""zup walm lug""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is situated between them, resulting in a series of three ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""
- In the fourth input (""wif zup bluf lug walm""), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is not in the output and thus isn't directly translatable to a color, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in three ""blue."" Here, the presence of ""bluf"" did not seem to impact the output.
- In the fifth input (""lug walm zup""), ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" produces an output of three ""blue"" again.

By examining these examples, we can see that the color preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. However, the first example still seems to break this pattern. Let's consider a revised hypothesis: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the input.

Using this hypothesis, let's check the first example again:

- In the first input (""wif walm zup walm""), ""wif"" is ""red,"" then ""walm"" turns into three ""red,"" but when the ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" it turns into three ""yellow"" instead of ""red."" This discrepancy might suggest that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that follows rather than precedes it in cases where ""walm"" appears at the end of the input, or there may be a mistake in the example.

If we align with the most consistent rule from all other examples and attribute the first example as a possible mistake or an exception (which may require more context or information to explain), the rule for ""walm"" would be:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds consistently to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of the other words present in the input. The other words in the inputs (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""zup"") correspond to their own colors; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""dax"" does not seem to change its output based on its position or the context provided by other words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red."" In each example, the inclusion of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Here are the examples broken down:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"")
2. Input: zup lug bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue red (""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""; ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
3. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" this time, which can denote ""bluf"" has no fixed mapping and depends on context, or the inconsistency could be part of a more complex rule we can’t decipher with current information)
4. Input: wif dax wif -> Output: red green red (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" both times; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"")
5. Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red (""dax"" corresponds to ""green""; ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" and possibly multiplies the preceding color; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")

With these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a color:

- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
- The word ""bluf"" doesn't appear in the inputs corresponding to the first four outputs, but when it does appear in the last example, it corresponds with ""blue"" again in the output.

From the observed correspondences, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

The meaning of ""zup"" is consistent across all examples, which implies that it translates to the color ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each instance:

1. bluf -> green red (when following wif dax)
2. bluf -> red (when following wif)
3. bluf -> yellow (when following zup)
4. bluf -> yellow (when following zup)
5. bluf -> blue (when following lug)

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. If we check this hypothesis against the provided examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" thus ""bluf"" output is ""green red"" (notice an extra color is added here, which might represent that ""bluf"" could be a duplicator whenever it appears after ""dax"").
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" thus ""bluf"" output is ""red.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" output is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" thus ""bluf"" output is ""blue.""

However, there's an irregularity with the first example where ""bluf"" generates two colors ""green red."" If we consider ""dax"" as a special case, we might say that whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it duplicates the color corresponding to ""dax"" and then appends ""red."" 

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color that precedes it with the exception when ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" in which case it duplicates ""dax's"" corresponding color (green) and appends ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" results in repeating the color that follows it three times. Here's the evidence supporting this rule:

- In the first example, ""walm lug"" results in ""red red red"" since ""lug"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The second example, ""dax walm wif,"" translates to the color for ""dax"" (green) followed by three greens because of ""walm,"" and then ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- The third example is ""zup walm,"" which results in three yellows, corresponding to ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup walm"" results in three reds for ""wif walm"" and three yellows for ""zup walm.""
- The final example, ""zup dax walm,"" shows ""zup"" as yellow, followed by ""dax"" as green and then three more greens due to ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the word following it to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, we observe that the word ""zup"" consistently yields the output ""yellow."" Independent of its position in the input (whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end), the output associated with ""zup"" remains unchanged. The other words in the examples (""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf"") generate different outputs, but ""zup"" is invariant, always resulting in ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Meaning that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the following word's color to be repeated three times in the output. Here is how this interpretation fits the examples:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and after ""walm,"" ""wif"" is repeated as ""blue"" three times.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated two more times.

3. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""zup"" should be repeated. However, there is no following word to repeat; hence, it seems the preceding ""dax"" was instead outputted thrice, followed by the translation for ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" turns into ""green"" three times, then ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"" replicated three times after ""walm.""

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""wif"" is repeated twice more.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the word that follows it to be repeated three times. If there is no following word, the translation of the preceding word is repeated instead.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the information provided by the examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the output ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position, regardless of context or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is presented in the input, it translates to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""zup."" 

Given that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""green green green,"" it can be inferred that each of these words corresponds to one or multiple specific colors in the output.

The word ""zup"" appears in various positions and always produces ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context provided by the other words. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> repeated word.

Rule: whenever bluf appears in an input, it is replaced with the color word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears directly after ""dax"", the output is ""green green green"", indicating ""walm"" might represent ""green"" in this context.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" once again and results in ""green green green"" as part of the output, supporting the initial observation.
- However, in the third, fourth, and fifth examples, ""walm"" does not yield ""green"" in the output. Instead, it appears directly after different words (""zup"", ""lug""), and each time it results in a repetition of the color associated with the word it follows (""yellow"" after ""zup"", ""blue"" after ""lug""). Thus, ""walm"" might indicate a repetition of the previous color's output.

From this, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with that word repeated three times. Therefore:

walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The examples provided consistently associate the nonce word ""lug"" with the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
Analyzing the examples provided:

1. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
2. ""lug dax zup wif"" -> ""blue green yellow red""
3. ""dax wif lug"" -> ""green red blue""
4. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
5. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""

Looking at the examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green"" due to its consistent translation regardless of its position in the input sequence:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and results in ""green"" after ""yellow"".
- In example 2, ""dax"" is between ""lug"" and ""zup"" and is again translated to ""green"".
- In example 3, ""dax"" precedes ""wif lug"" and translates to ""green"" before ""red blue"".
- In example 4, ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""green"".
- In example 5, ""dax"" precedes ""lug walm"" and is translated to ""green"".

Based on this analysis, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word is associated with a particular color as the output.

Here's the pattern that can be extracted from the examples:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems straightforward:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the underlying rule for the word ""bluf."" Let's analyze each instance where ""bluf"" occurs and compare the sequence of ""bluf"" with the corresponding output sequence.

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Let's identify patterns before and after the word ""bluf"" in each example:

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the output corresponds to ""red red."" (Examples 1, 3, and 4)
2. When ""bluf"" appears directly after ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" before being followed by another color depending on the next word. (Example 2, ""dax bluf"" is followed by ""green green"", and in Example 5, ""dax bluf"" is followed by ""green yellow."")
3. The presence of ""bluf"" leads to duplication of the color in the output that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" (Examples 1, 3, and 4 show the word before ""bluf"" is reflected twice in the output, while in Example 2, ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of ""green"")

Given these observations, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output.

Thus:

bluf -> meaning: The color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should analyze the relationship between the input and its corresponding output across the examples provided. Let's break down each example:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows it, ""walm"" may be repeating the color of the word preceding it, which is ""blue.""

2. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated twice. Then ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" it's followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and then ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
   - It seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word three times.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after a second ""dax,"" we have ""walm,"" followed by three greens.
   - This supports the hypothesis that ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of the color tied to the word right before it.

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - With ""lug"" as blue, followed by ""walm,"" we have the repeating ""blue"" three times, and then with ""dax,"" we have ""green.""
   - Even with another color word following ""walm,"" it appears to only affect the color before it, not after.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - This is the same first example and the output is consistent with the earlier deduction.

Rule:
walm -> causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,43
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can induce that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" In each example where ""lug"" is present, the output includes the word ""blue"" at the corresponding position.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

The examples indicate that the presence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of the other words surrounding it. The consistency of this association across different inputs, where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or where ""dax"" is presented alone or repeated, reinforces that the meaning attached to ""dax"" is ""green."" Moreover, in the sequence that contains multiple words (""zup dax zup dax wif bluf""), ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" while other colors are associated with different words.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Here is the pattern deduced from the examples:

- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug wif lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue red blue,"" where each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" where ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red.""
- Finally, the input ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red,"" further confirming that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Here's the reasoning:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- No matter the position of ""zup"" (beginning, middle, end), ""yellow"" always follows where ""zup"" is. For example:
   - In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""zup"" is first, and the output starts with ""yellow.""
   - In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is in the middle, and ""yellow"" is in the middle of the output.
   - In ""dax wif zup dax,"" ""zup"" is the third word, hence ""yellow"" is the third word in the output.

None of the surrounding words' positions seem to affect this association. Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color mentioned directly before it. If ""wif"" means red and ""zup"" means yellow, then ""bluf"" repeated after either takes on the color of the preceding word.
Observing the examples given:

Input: dax walm zup lug  
Output: green green green yellow blue

Input: lug walm  
Output: blue blue blue

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf  
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup  
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Input: zup wif dax walm lug  
Output: yellow red green green green blue

From these outputs, we can deduce that the output after ""walm"" is consistently a repetition of the last color before ""walm."" Based on this pattern, we can formulate a rule about the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the next color in the output is a repetition of the last color that appeared before ""walm"". 

Therefore:

walm -> repeat the last color mentioned before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Whether ""dax"" is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sequence, it is always translated to ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, each unique non-wif word is assigned a unique color (e.g., zup -> yellow, dax -> green, lug -> blue, walm -> yellow, bluf -> red). The nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in every example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red. 

Meaning: The word ""wif"" directly translates to the color red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Given the examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" every time it appears. There is no indication that the meaning of ""zup"" changes depending on its position or context within a sequence. Therefore, the rule is that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""red blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""

Therefore, we can infer that ""bluf"" in the output depends on the word that precedes it. When alone, it seems to be ""red,"" but this alone is not sufficient to fully determine its meaning. Since ""bluf"" never appears at the beginning of the input, we cannot conclusively determine its standalone output.

However, by looking at other patterns, we can see that ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively, each time they appear. With ""bluf,"" the colour that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it is repeated (except with ""zup,"" which precedes ""bluf"" only once, making it difficult to establish a firm rule).

Therefore, a tentative rule we can deduce is:
- When preceded by another color word, ""bluf"" results in that color being repeated in the output. The exception is with ""zup,"" as there's insufficient data to confirm the pattern. When it appears second, it may result in ""red"" as output, but further examples are required for confirmation.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the colour of the preceding word in the output, with potential exceptions that need more data.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will compare the input and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax lug walm 
   Output: green blue blue blue 

2. Input: dax lug walm 
   Output: green blue blue blue 

3. Input: dax walm 
   Output: green green green 

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug 
   Output: yellow red green green green blue 

5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif 
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red 

Looking at these examples, we can start to form some rules based on the sequences and their outputs:

- Whenever ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of ""green"" (Example 3).
- When ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" the output is a repetition of ""blue,"" but one less than the number of repetitions in Example 3 (Example 1).
- When ""walm"" is surrounded by different nonce words, it results in a sequence of ""green"" corresponding to its position after ""dax,"" but not affected by the other surrounding words (Example 4).

Based on these observations, the word ""walm"" seems to initiate repetition of the color that correlates with the word preceding it. The number of repetitions in examples 1 and 3 can be determined by the position of ""walm"" right after ""dax"" or ""lug."" However, when ""walm"" appears not immediately after ""dax"" or ""lug,"" but there is a ""dax"" before it, the color ""green"" is repeated, but the count or sequence does not reset to three unless ""walm"" is directly after ""dax"" (Example 4).

Given these rules, my deduction is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" seems to indicate the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, with the number of repetitions linked to its position following that preceding word. When directly after ""dax,"" it repeats ""green"" three times. When directly after ""lug,"" it repeats ""blue"" for as many times minus one as it does ""green"" with ""dax."" When not directly following ""dax"" or ""lug,"" but ""dax"" precedes it in the sequence, ""green"" is the color that's repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" would be:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word, the number of times appears to depend on the specific rule associated with the preceding word (three times when following ""dax"" and one less than three times when following ""lug"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm zup
    ",Output: red red red yellow,red red red yellow,True,45
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sentence.
wif -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif translates to ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, here are the rules I've deduced:

- ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by another ""zup,"" they are each translated to ""yellow,"" with ""wif"" in between translating to ""red.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" without another ""zup"" results in ""yellow red.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""dax"" translates to ""yellow green.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and then ""dax,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Rule: 
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red (when placed between ""zup"" words or after ""zup"")
- dax -> green (when it follows ""zup"" or ""bluf"")
- bluf -> yellow (when it follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax"")
To determine the meaning or rule of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples given:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. lug bluf -> blue blue
3. wif dax bluf -> red green green
4. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
5. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow

From these examples, we notice that whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output involves repeating the color that came before it. For example:

- In the first case, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat ""red.""
- In the second case, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" doubles the ""blue"" in the output.
- In the third case, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes a repetition of ""green,"" ignoring ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" repeats the ""blue,"" and ""wif"" adds ""red"" afterward.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" doubles the ""yellow,"" ignoring both ""red"" and ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word, doubling its output.
Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, the output is three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.

Explanation:
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" where ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and preceded ""walm"" leading to the three repetitions of ""blue.""
- ""dax walm lug"" outputs ""green green green blue"" where ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and is followed by ""walm"" leading to the three repetitions of ""green.""
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" again showing ""lug"" before ""walm"" leading to the three ""blue"" repetitions.
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" which is straightforward as ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" giving three ""blue.""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" outputs ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"" in the middle of the sequence.

So, walm -> following a color word (such as lug for blue or dax for green), output that color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,46
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the sequence or surrounding words. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input is directly translated to ""green"" in the output. Meanwhile, the other words each correspond to their own color (though the color for each is not explicitly stated in the examples, we can infer some of them based on repeated patterns: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"").

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Every example starts with ""wif,"" and each corresponding output begins with ""red."" The color that follows appears to be associated with the second word in the input sequence.

Here's a breakdown:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow"" (based on the first input, where ""walm"" and ""lug"" both follow ""wif"" and produce ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively; this pattern repeats twice)
- ""bluf"" appears consistently with the output ""red red,"" meaning ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule appears to be direct and unwavering. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

1. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue
   Analysis: The term ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The term ""bluf"" also results in ""blue,"" which follows the output of ""lug.""

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Analysis: Here, ""wif"" is again followed by ""bluf."" Given that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is followed by an output of ""red,"" ""bluf"" in this context seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   Analysis: The sequence ""dax wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green red red green."" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" that follows has an output ""red,"" repeating the color of the preceding word. ""Dax"" results in ""green.""

4. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   Analysis: ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which also results in ""green."" ""Bluf"" once again repeats the color of the word before it. ""Zup"" results in ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   Analysis: In the sequences ""dax bluf"" and ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, ""dax"" to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it repeats the ""red"" color.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. In each input, the color that follows ""walm"" is the same as the color that precedes it.

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and after ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated.
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and after ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated.
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and after ""walm,"" the color red is repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" results in repeated blue.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" results in repeated yellow.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,False,47
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In all provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- The input words ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm"" correspond to the colors ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""blue,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

With these observations, we arrive at the following rule:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll analyze the provided examples and focus on the outputs tied to the occurrences of ""wif"" in the inputs.

In the first example:
- Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
  - This suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

In the second example:
- Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif -> Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
  - ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue"" consistently.
  - ""walm"" appears to be linked to ""blue"" as well, although it's not clear why it outputs ""blue"" three times. It could be that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color of the word before it.
  - ""dax"" confirmed again as ""green.""
  - ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""red,"" consistent with the first example.

In the third example:
- Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
  - Given that ""walm"" might repeat the color before it and ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" it is consistent that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats that ""red"" twice.

In the fourth example:
- Input: wif -> Output: red
  - This confirms that ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""

In the fifth example:
- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
  - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and again ""walm"" appears to repeat this color twice.
  - ""dax"" confirms as ""green.""
  - ""zup"" seems to be a new word, translating to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule is quite clear for ""wif,"" and we can articulate the meaning directly:

Rule: wif -> red. ""Wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""
Given the examples provided, we can analyze the word ""zup"" by looking at its correspondence in the output in each instance. Let's break it down:

1. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
    - Just before ""zup"" we have ""bluf"" which is ""green"" in the output, and right after ""zup"" we have ""lug"" which is ""blue"" in the output.

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
    - ""Zup"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
    - ""Zup"" follows ""wif"" which again corresponds to ""red"" in the output, and before the next ""wif"" we have ""yellow"".

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
    - ""Zup"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green"" in the output, and follows with ""walm"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug dax zup
   Output: blue green yellow
    - ""Zup"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

From the examples provided, we can deduce that ""zup"" always follows a color word and is translated to ""yellow."" Therefore, it seems that the rule underlying the problem is that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare the inputs containing ""bluf"" to their corresponding outputs and look for patterns that correspond to the word ""bluf.""

Let's start by listing down all the instances of ""bluf"" from the examples given and the corresponding outputs:

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
2. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

Next, let's isolate the sections where ""bluf"" appears:

1. bluf -> red
2. bluf -> green
3. bluf -> green
4. bluf -> red
5. bluf -> red

From these examples with ""bluf,"" we see that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" (in examples 2 and 3) and ""red"" in all other instances.

Given these examples, we cannot say that ""bluf"" corresponds to a particular color without considering its context. Instead, the word ""bluf"" seems to change its meaning based on the words surrounding it, specifically when preceded by ""dax.""

Here's a tentative rule based on the given examples:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it translates to ""green,"" otherwise, it translates to ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to dictate the color and repetition in the output. Whenever ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is a series of ""red"" repeated once more than the number of words before ""walm"". When ""walm"" appears without ""wif,"" the output is a series of another color, which correlates to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" and the number of repetitions equals the number of times ""walm"" appears.

Analyzing the examples:

- wif walm -> red red red (3 reds)
- zup wif walm -> yellow red red red (1 yellow + 3 reds)
- dax wif walm -> green red red red (1 green + 3 reds)
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (3 yellows, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow)
- dax walm -> green green green (3 greens, and ""dax"" corresponds to green)

The rule:

1. If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" output ""red"" repeated one more time than the total number of words preceding ""walm.""
2. If ""walm"" follows another word, output the color corresponding to that word, repeated as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned.

Rule: walm -> when following ""wif,"" output ""red"" repeated one additional time than the count of preceding words. When following another word, that word dictates the color, and the count of the color in the output matches the count of the word ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,False,48
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, each English word seems to correspond to a color:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green""
- ""walm"" is consistent with the output ""blue"" as well, although it is seen only once

Taking those into account, one can induce that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
wif -> meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: Based on the provided examples, every time 'zup' is used in the input, 'yellow' appears in the corresponding output, regardless of its position or other words around it. Thus, 'zup' very likely means 'yellow'.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color word that would correspond to the word that comes immediately before it. The rule seems to be:

""If a color word is followed by 'bluf,' repeat the color word that corresponds to it.""

Let's look at the examples to see this pattern:

- Input: dax bluf — Output: green green (dax corresponds to green, followed by bluf, hence green is repeated)
- Input: lug bluf zup lug — Output: blue blue yellow blue (lug corresponds to blue, followed by bluf, so blue is repeated; note that zup's corresponding yellow is not repeated as it's not followed by bluf)
- Input: wif bluf dax walm — Output: red red green green green (wif corresponds to red, followed by bluf, hence red is repeated; dax's green is not affected by bluf here, walm is a green repetition but not influenced by bluf)
- Input: lug bluf — Output: blue blue (lug corresponds to blue, followed by bluf, so blue is repeated)
- Input: lug wif bluf — Output: blue red red (wif corresponds to red, followed by bluf, hence red is repeated; lug's corresponding blue is not repeated here as it's not immediately followed by bluf)

Given the above observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to repeat.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided examples. Let's examine each input and associated output to decipher the rules:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

5. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

We notice that the color that follows each occurrence of ""walm"" differs, which suggests ""walm"" is dependent on the context or the word that follows it. Let's look at the color that comes after ""walm"" in each case:

1. green -> yellow, blue
2. green -> yellow
3. red -> green
4. green -> red
5. green -> red, green

By examining the relationship between ""walm"" and the following word/color, we can attempt to extract a rule. However, with the given examples, the output color doesn't seem directly linked to the specific word that follows ""walm.""

Let's look at the words preceding ""walm"" instead:

1. dax -> green
2. dax -> green
3. wif -> red
4. dax -> green
5. dax -> green

The word preceding ""walm"" corresponds to a color in the output. Now let's see if ""walm"" has an effect on this:

- After ""dax walm,"" we observe an additional ""green"" before it changes to other colors.
- ""wif walm"" also produces an additional ""red.""

It appears that ""walm"" may function as a repeater for the color implied by the word immediately before ""walm."" Essentially, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word before ""walm.""

Given the examples, let's illustrate the rule:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm -> The first ""walm"" repeats ""green,"" hence ""green green."" The second ""walm"" repeats ""blue,"" hence ""blue blue.""
2. Input: dax walm zup lug -> ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats ""green,"" resulting in ""green green.""
3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> ""walm"" following ""wif"" repeats ""red,"" resulting in ""red red.""
4. Input: dax walm wif -> ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats ""green,"" resulting in ""green green.""
5. Input: dax walm wif dax -> ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats ""green,"" so ""green green,"" and there is no ""walm"" after ""wif"" to influence the output.

Therefore, walm -> Repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" each time it appears.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the word ""dax"". 

Looking at each input/output pair:

1. ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green""
2. ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow""
3. ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green""
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
5. ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green"" again

From these examples, we can observe the following pattern:

- The word ""dax"" always correlates to the output ""green"".
- The correlation does not change in the presence of other words such as ""lug"", ""wif"", ""zup"", or ""walm"".

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output. Additionally, there does not seem to be any variation in the output dependent on the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, suggesting that ""zup"" consistently represents the same color regardless of context.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided.

In the first line:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

In this line, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow."" So it's possible ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""

In the second line:
Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Just as in the first line, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow."" The rest of the words correspond to other colors.

In the third line:
Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

""Bluf"" in this line is again corresponding to ""green,"" the color that comes right before it. This suggests that ""bluf"" might be a repeater word, taking the same meaning as the word (or color) immediately preceding it.

In the fourth and fifth lines:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

In both these lines, ""bluf"" again takes the color that directly precedes it. In the fourth, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and so ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" In the fifth, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" likewise translates to ""green.""

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color indicated by the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the meaning (color) of the word directly before it.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to review the provided examples and find a consistent pattern that can be applied across all inputs.

We have the following input/output pairs:

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Looking at the examples:

- When ""wif"" is in the input, ""red"" is in the output.
- When ""lug"" is in the input, ""blue"" is in the output.
- When ""dax"" is in the input, ""green"" is in the output.
- When ""bluf"" is in the input, ""blue"" is in the output.
- When ""zup"" is in the input, ""yellow"" is in the output.

From the above, we can establish that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output.

Upon reviewing the occurrences of ""walm"" in the input, a pattern emerges in the output:

- ""walm"" consistently causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be three:
  
  - In the first example, ""walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue"".
  - In the second example, ""walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue"".
  - In the third example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue red"".
  - In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".
  - In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Given this pattern, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the following word three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the next word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue each time it appears in the input.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   This suggests that ""dax"" might correspond to ""green,"" since ""walm"" also appears to correspond to ""green"" and ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue."" However, we have an unknown for ""zup.""

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   This reinforces the idea that ""dax"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""green.""

3. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   This suggests ""dax"" is ""green"" again, ""zup"" might be ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" remains consistent with ""blue."" ""Bluf"" is a new word, but appears to correspond to ""blue.""

4. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   Here, ""lug"" comes before ""dax"" and still corresponds to ""blue,"" reaffirming that ""dax"" is ""green."" ""Wif"" is new and could correspond to ""red.""

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Here, the pattern repeats with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" once more.


Given the consistent pattern across different examples, we can deduce the following meaning:

Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of ""dax"" in the inputs consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the given input and their corresponding output.

1. Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow green yellow green red red
4. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
5. Input: dax wif dax -> Output: green red green

From these examples, it's clear that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sentence. It does not seem dependent on context. The other words (dax, zup, walm, lug, bluf) correlate to different colors (green, yellow, yellow, blue, red), which suggests that ""wif"" has a consistent meaning, independent of the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
From the provided examples, it is evident that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of where ""zup"" appears in the sequence or the other words present, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Thus, the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" I will look at the patterns before and after its occurrence in the given examples and their corresponding outputs. Let's analyze each input with its output:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
4. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   
5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

From these examples, we notice the following:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the color that follows ""bluf"" in the output pattern is influenced by the word just before ""bluf"".
- When ""wif"" is the word before ""bluf,"" the output color is always red, indicated by the outputs that contain ""wif bluf"" -> red red.
- When ""dax"" is the word before ""bluf,"" the output color is green, noticed in the sequence ""dax bluf"" -> green green.
- When ""zup"" is the word before ""bluf,"" the output color is yellow, seen in the sequence ""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow.

Given these observations, we can induce that the ""bluf"" itself may not have its own color but rather duplicates the color assigned to the word that comes immediately before it. Hence, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine how the outputs change with respect to the words preceding and succeeding ""walm.""

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and succeeded by another ""dax,""
Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
The only output that does not match the direct color translation (dax -> green, wif -> red) is the middle 'green,' which corresponds to ""walm."" However, the following red seems to be influenced by having ""dax"" after ""wif.""

2. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and succeeded by ""lug,""
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
Here, all instances of ""walm"" are followed by red (representing ""wif""), and the color to represent ""lug"" appears to be blue.

3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and succeeded by ""dax,""
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Again, the color red follows ""wif,"" and the color to represent ""dax"" is green.

4. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and succeeded by nothing,
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Here, blue corresponds to ""lug,"" and ""walm"" maintains the blue coloration.

5. When ""walm"" is involved with multiple words,
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
""Walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" and the pattern seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug bluf dax wif
    ",Output: yellow green green blue blue green red,yellow green green green blue blue green red,False,51
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: Lug seems to correspond to the color blue, based on the direct substitution seen in the examples provided:

- ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow"" with ""lug"" directly corresponding to ""blue.""
- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" with ""lug"" being the last word, replaced by ""blue.""
- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" with ""lug"" replacing the second word, corresponding to ""blue.""
- ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green,"" where ""lug"" is again the second word, replaced by ""blue.""
- ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green,"" placing ""lug"" as the first word, corresponding to ""blue.""

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""dax"" appears as an input, the corresponding output is ""green"". The other words in the inputs (""zup"", ""wif"", ""lug"", ""bluf"") are associated with different colors in the output. But the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the input-output pairs:

1) zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
2) wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
3) wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
4) dax zup wif -> green yellow red
5) lug walm wif -> blue blue blue red

Analyzing the given examples, let's establish the associations we can see for words other than ""wif"":

- ""zup"" is consistently associated with ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"", but in example 3, it follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug"" and is still ""red"", so there's no direct influence from ""wif"" here.
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
- For ""walm,"" there is only one instance, and it is associated with ""blue"".

Now, let's inspect the instances in which ""wif"" is used:

- In example 1, ""wif"" appears twice and is associated with ""red"" both times, regardless of the position.
- In example 2, ""wif"" is the first and third word in the sequence and both are associated with ""red"".
- In example 3, ""wif"" is the first word and is associated with ""red"".
- In example 4, ""wif"" is the final word and is associated with ""red"".
- In example 5, ""wif"" is the last word again and is associated with ""red"".

Given that in all examples, the word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color ""red"" regardless of its position or surrounding words, it seems clear that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" independently of context.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
bluf -> repeats the color word that precedes it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows a color word, it means to repeat that color word.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the given examples, let's look for patterns in the inputs and outputs.

1. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

From this example, we can see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" follows both ""wif"" and ""zup"" and subsequent colors change in the output, it's reasonable to assume ""walm"" has an effect on the following words' output colors.

We also see that after the second ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times instead of once. This may indicate that ""walm"" influences the number of times the following color is repeated.

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

In this example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and there are three ""red"" outputs. Since there is no word following ""walm,"" we cannot infer the effect of ""walm"" on the subsequent word here.

3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The ""walm"" after ""lug"" does not seem to affect the ""wif"" that follows, since the output is not altered in quantity or color. However, after the second ""wif,"" we see ""yellow red,"" which suggests that ""red"" was supposed to be repeated but was not due to the presence of ""zup"" before the final ""wif.""

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to an additional ""red"" being produced before changing to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

""Zup"" normally corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" but after ""walm,"" it is repeated three times. This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" influences the number of times the following color is repeated. 

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence to be repeated three times. If there is no word after ""walm,"" it appears to have no discernible effect.

Therefore: walm -> causes the next color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm wif walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: green green green red red red green green green blue green,green green green red red red green blue green,False,52
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
Based on the presented examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning of ""wif."" Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. Input: zup wif zup
Output: yellow red yellow
- ""wif"" appears between two ""zup"" which are translated to ""yellow"".

2. Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""wif"" appears before ""lug,"" which is translated to ""blue"".

3. Input: wif lug wif
Output: red blue red
- The first ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" translated to ""blue,"" and the second ""wif"" is at the end, with both instances of ""wif"" being translated to ""red.""

4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, after ""zup"" which is consistent with being translated to ""red.""

5. Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- This is similar to the second example and ""wif"" is again followed by ""lug"" translated to ""blue"" with ""wif"" translated to ""red.""

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" no matter its position or the context.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, whenever the input begins with ""zup,"" the subsequent output always begins with ""yellow."" The presence of other words in the input does not affect the translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The other words (wif, bluf, dax, walm) correspond to different colors (red, blue, green, yellow) in the output, but ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of their position or presence.
Based on the given examples, the apparent rule is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"". Here is the reasoning:

- Every time ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- ""bluf"" seems to be independent of its position in the sequence since it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of where it is placed.
- Other words like ""wif"", ""lug"", ""zup"", and ""dax"" correspond to ""red"", ""blue"", ""yellow"", and ""green"" respectively, regardless of their position in the input.

Rule: bluf -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern in which colors correspond to words in each given input and output example.

In the first example, when ""wif walm"" appears together, they result in ""red red red."" In the second example, ""wif walm dax"" gives us ""red red red green."" In the third example, ""dax walm"" gives us ""green green green."" In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" again results in ""red red red"". In the last example, ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color output of the word before it to repeat three times. Let's apply this rule to confirm it fits all instances:

1. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and 'red' is repeated thrice afterward.
2. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and 'red' is repeated thrice before moving to the next word ""dax,"" which is 'green.'
3. ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and 'green' is repeated thrice following it.
4. ""wif walm"" directly results in ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and 'red' is repeated thrice.
5. ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and 'blue' is repeated thrice before it moves to ""wif"" and then another ""lug.""

Therefore, we can induce the rule:

Rule: walm -> when placed after a word, it causes the color output associated with that preceding word to be repeated three times.

Example using the rule: ""XXX walm YYY"" translates into ""color_of_XXX color_of_XXX color_of_XXX color_of_YYY.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug
    ",Output: blue green blue,blue green blue,True,53
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green."" It appears that each unique nonce word is associated with a specific color. The recurring pattern is that when ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" shows up in the same position in the output.

Here is the rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided input and output examples, we can attempt to discern a pattern that relates ""wif"" with the corresponding color output. Here is a breakdown of each provided example along with any apparent/established relationships:

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
  Here, ""wif"" is followed by the term ""bluf"" and results in ""red red."" No other context is given.

- Input: wif -> Output: red
  Alone, ""wif"" results in ""red.""

- Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
  ""Wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" yielding ""red green."" It seems that ""wif"" is still associated with ""red.""

- Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
  ""Dax"" comes before ""wif,"" resulting in ""green red."" The position of ""wif"" after ""dax"" changes the output for ""dax"" but not for ""wif,"" which is still ""red.""

- Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif -> Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
  In a longer sequence, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position relative to the other nonce words.

From these observations, we can deduce a rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the context of other words around it.

Therefore:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" each time it appears. However, it seems that ""zup"" can be followed by another word which might alter the meaning. In one example, ""zup wif"" yielded ""yellow red,"" indicating ""wif"" means red. When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" or ""bluf,"" it seems to keep its meaning as ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""yellow.""

However, in the example ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" translating word by word seems to give the output ""yellow yellow blue yellow"" but the actual output replaces ""blue"" with ""yellow,"" making it look like ""bluf"" introduces an error or exception to the rule that alters the color sequence by rendering the following color as ""yellow."" No direct translation or consistent pattern has been given for ""walm,"" but it is followed by ""yellow"" in the output, suggesting that ""walm"" may also translate to ""yellow"" or that it prompts a repetition of ""zup's"" translation which is ""yellow.""

Given the available data, we can infer the following rules with regard to ""zup"":

Rule:
- ""zup"" on its own means ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""lug"" translates to ""yellow blue.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" translates to ""yellow red.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" or ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that these words may cause a repetition or reinforcement of the color ""yellow.""

Until more context is provided, especially regarding ""bluf"" and ""walm,"" and how they interact with the color sequences, the rule that these induce repeat ""yellow"" is a speculative inference.
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it:

1. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue (bluf repeats ""lug"" which is blue)
2. wif bluf -> red red (bluf repeats ""wif"" which is red)
3. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red (bluf repeats ""lug"" which is blue)
4. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow (bluf repeats ""zup"" which is yellow)
5. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue (bluf repeats ""lug"" which is blue)

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" has a particular effect on the output related to color repetitions. Here is the rule I deduced:

Whenever ""walm"" appears after a word in the input, the corresponding color for that word is repeated three times in the output. Now, let's cross-verify this with the provided examples:

- Example 1: ""dax zup dax walm"" outputs ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and thus ""green"" is repeated thrice immediately following its regular occurrence.

- Example 2: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" outputs ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times immediately after its regular occurrence.

- Example 3: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" In this case, ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" so ""blue"" is repeated three times immediately after ""bluf.""

- Example 4: ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, we see ""red"" repeated three times.

- Example 5: ""dax walm zup walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" This has two instances of ""walm,"" after ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), and in both cases, we see the respective colors repeated three times each.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" occurs after a word, it causes the color associated with that word to repeat three times in the output immediately following its regular occurrence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,54
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" can be represented as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern for the word ""dax"" and its corresponding output color:

- When ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".

To confirm, let's test our hypothesis against all the provided examples:

- In ""Input: dax zup dax"", the output is ""green yellow green"", with both appearances of ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"".
- In ""Input: dax zup"", the output is ""green yellow"", with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"".
- In ""Input: zup dax"", the output is ""yellow green"", with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"".
- In ""Input: zup bluf wif dax lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence ""yellow yellow red green blue"".
- In ""Input: dax wif bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence ""green red red"".

Therefore, we can conclude that the following rule applies:

Rule: dax -> green
By examining the patterns in the examples given, we can deduce the likely meaning or rule for the word ""wif"". Let's analyze each case:

1. When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is red.
    Input: wif
    Output: red

2. When ""wif"" appears before other words, it consistently results in ""red"" being the first in the output sequence.
    Input: wif lug zup bluf
    Output: red blue yellow yellow
    
    Input: wif dax bluf
    Output: red green green

3. ""wif"" can appear multiple times in an input and each time it maps to ""red"" in the output order of appearance.
    Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
    Output: red red green green red red red blue red

4. Other words in the examples generate consistent colours regardless of their position relative to ""wif"":
    ""lug"" -> blue
    ""zup"" -> yellow
    ""dax"" -> green
    ""walm"" -> red (it seems to match with ""wif"" in the first example)
    ""bluf"" -> green

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following associations for the nonce words:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- walm -> red (repeated as many times as there are letters in the word, so ""walm"" results in ""red red red"")
- dax -> green

The word ""zup"" appears to produce the output ""yellow"" consistently, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" is: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the correspondence between the presence of the word and the changes in the output colors. Here is what we can deduce from each example:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
3. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
5. ""zup lug bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue red""

Looking at the instances where ""bluf"" is used, we see:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red, then ""bluf"" is followed by red.
- In the second example, even with the addition of ""walm"" after ""dax,"" ""bluf"" still corresponds with the red color.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and once again ""wif"" to red and ""bluf"" to red.
- In the fourth example, without any other context, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both result in red.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" yields yellow, ""lug"" yields blue, and in this context ""bluf"" yields blue.

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to either red or blue. However, ""bluf"" yields blue only in the presence of ""lug,"" which also corresponds to blue. This could mean that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word immediately before it unless it's following ""wif,"" in which case it outputs red.

From this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" results in a color output that matches the previous word's color, except when it follows ""wif,"" which always makes ""bluf"" correspond to red.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of a color word that was previously mentioned in the input. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times in the output. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
   - ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"", and 'walm' follows, leading to the color being repeated three times.

2. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
   - ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"", and 'walm' follows, leading to the color being repeated three times.

3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"".
   - Here ""walm"" follows ""bluf wif"", and since ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"", 'walm' causes ""red"" to be repeated three times at the end.

4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" leads to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"".
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""lug wif"", which means that the last mentioned color before ""walm"" was ""red"", coming from ""bluf"". Consequently, 'walm' causes ""red"" to be repeated three times, followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

5. ""lug walm wif lug"" leads to ""blue blue blue red blue"".
   - Here ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue"", resulting in the color ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,55
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue""
   - Input: wif lug
     Output: red blue
   
2. The combination ""lug dax"" produces ""blue green""
   - Input: lug dax walm
     Output: blue green green green
   - We can infer that ""walm"" means green.

3. When ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" the output sequence starts with ""green blue""
   - Input: dax lug
     Output: green blue

4. The sequence ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" produces ""blue red red green blue blue""
   - We can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" within this sequence and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in both appearances. The output for ""dax"" is ""green"" here as well.

Given these observations, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of the words before or after it in the examples. Each appearance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in each output sequence. Thus, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
From the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input list. Each subsequent word corresponds with a color as well, but ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Thus, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: dax -> green

The meaning or rule behind other words can be speculated as follows:

- ""wif"" always maps to ""red""
- ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" usually maps to ""yellow,"" but its exact rule is unclear since it doesn't appear without a ""wif"" or ""dax"" preceding it.
- ""walm"" always maps to ""red"" when it appears after ""dax"" or ""zup,"" and it occurs twice after ""zup"" in the second input.
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" when it appears after ""dax"" or as a standalone word.

However, since the task is only to determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we stick with the established rule for ""dax.""
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"":

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- ""lug"" appears to correlate with ""blue""
- ""walm"" appears to correlate with ""red""

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- ""wif"" appears to correlate with ""red"" as it is the first word and ""red"" is the first color in the output.
- ""bluf"" appears to correlate with ""blue""

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" is the last word, correlating with the last ""red"" in the output.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""wif"" as the first word again correlates with the first ""red""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- With ""dax"" coming first and ""green"" being the first color, ""wif"" follows as the second word and second color, which is ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
From the given examples, it seems that each nonce word translates to a specific color. ""Dax"" consistently translates to green, ""lug"" to blue, ""walm"" to green, and ""wif"" to red. ""Zup"" appears to always translate to yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the colour associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the colour of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- In the second example, ""zup dax bluf"" becomes ""yellow green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" repeats the colour of ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the third example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" translates into ""green blue red red,"" again showing the repetition of the red associated with ""wif.""
- The fourth example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" turns into ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" making ""bluf"" repeat the colour of the last ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red yellow,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the red colour of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" repeats the colour associated with the word that comes right before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the colour of the previous word.
From the examples given, it seems that the appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" changes the output color to red for the word following it. If there is no word following ""walm"", no red is appended, as can be seen in the third example where ""walm"" is the last word and no additional red appears in the output. Here are the assessments:

- Input: dax walm wif
  Output: green green green red
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
  - ""walm wif"" corresponds to ""green red""  

- Input: wif walm dax
  Output: red red red green
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  - ""walm dax"" corresponds to ""red green""

- Input: zup dax lug walm zup
  Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""walm zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow""

- Input: zup wif walm lug
  Output: yellow red red red blue
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  - ""walm lug"" corresponds to ""red blue""

- Input: dax walm wif walm
  Output: green green green red red red
  - ""dax"" corresponds to “green""
  - ""walm wif"" corresponds to ""green red""
  - ""walm"" by itself at the end of the sequence does not add a red

Based on these assessments, the rule is:

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes another nonce word, the output color is red for the word that follows ""walm"".

walm -> meaning: Changes the color of the word following it to red. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it has no effect on the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug
    ",Output: yellow green green blue,yellow green green green blue,False,56
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Looking at the other words, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""zup"" appears to translate to ""yellow,"" but we only have one instance of it, so it's less certain than the others.

Here is the deduction from the provided examples:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" is the only word and translates to ""green.""

2. Input: dax lug dax wif dax
   Output: green blue green red green
   - Each instance of ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

3. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" does not have a corresponding output in this example, but based on its position, it may be ignored or treated as an error without translation.

4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - This is identical to the first example, further confirming that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

5. Input: zup dax lug dax
   Output: yellow green blue green
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and here ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow.""

Rule:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red."" There is no variation in the output associated with the word ""wif,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. However, we can see that other words such as ""dax"" and ""zup bluf"" correspond to different output colors (""green"" and ""yellow yellow,"" respectively).

Rule: wif -> red

This rule means that the word ""wif"" translates to the color red in the output, independent of context or position within the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be an element that takes on the characteristic of the word immediately preceding it in terms of the output color. If we analyze the examples given:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
5. wif bluf -> red red

From examples 1, 2, 3, and 5, we can see that whenever ""bluf"" follows another word, the color output of ""bluf"" matches the color output of that preceding word:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" following ""dax"" also corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" following ""zup"" also corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" following ""wif"" also corresponds to red.

Example 4 further supports this as ""zup bluf"" results in yellow yellow, and when ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"", which on its own would result in blue, ""bluf"" does not affect the output color of ""lug"".

Rule: bluf -> takes on the output color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word preceding it three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times. For example:
- ""dax lug walm"" resulted in ""green blue blue blue"", with ""lug"" associated with blue, and ""walm"" causing the repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" yielded ""yellow yellow yellow"", with ""zup"" associated with yellow, and ""walm"" leading to the color ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translated to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" before ""walm"" is associated with yellow, so ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" generated ""green green green"", with ""dax"" associated with green, and ""walm"" leading to the color ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" initiated ""red red red"", with ""wif"" related to red, and ""walm"" causing ""red"" to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax bluf wif
    ",Output: green green red,green green red,True,57
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the given examples. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to always correspond to the color ""red"". Here is the evidence from the examples:

1. wif dax lug -> red green blue (wif corresponds to red)
2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (wif corresponds to red)
3. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red (wif corresponds to red)
4. wif -> red (straightforward, wif corresponds to red)
5. wif -> red (straightforward, wif corresponds to red)

There is no evidence that ""wif"" depends on any other context, position, or surrounding words—it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of where it appears in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Given the examples, we can induce the following rule regarding the nonce word ""zup"":

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""walm"" corresponds to the triplet of the color it represents, i.e., blue.

Therefore, every time ""zup"" appears, the output becomes ""yellow"". We can deduce that independent of its position or the surrounding context, ""zup"" always results in the color yellow. 

Hence, the rule induced is:

zup -> meaning: yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red."" However, it's also important to notice that ""bluf"" duplicates the color that comes directly before it in the output. Below are the breakdowns of each example to illustrate this:

- wif bluf -> red red (bluf copies the ""red"" from ""wif"")
- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red (bluf copies the ""red"" from ""wif"")
- zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue (bluf first copies ""green"" from ""dax"" and then copies ""yellow"" from ""zup"")
- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red (bluf copies the ""red"" from ""wif"")
- dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue (bluf copies the ""blue"" from ""lug"")

Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it replicates the color word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. 

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word immediately prior to it in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule that defines what ""walm"" means in this specific context by comparing inputs and corresponding outputs.

The words that precede ""walm"" in the inputs seem to affect the output color, but the amount of repetition of that color in the output corresponds to the presence of the word ""walm"". Here are the observations:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". 
2. ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue"", which confirms the consistency of the input-output relationship for ""lug"" and ""walm"".
3. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"", which indicates that ""zup"" might correspond to yellow and ""wif"" to red. Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug"", and there are three reds in the output before a single blue, this suggests that ""walm"" is related to a repetition of the last color mentioned.
4. ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red"". Here, ""dax"" seems to correspond to green, and after both instances of ""walm"" there is a repetition of the preceding color three times.
5. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", reaffirming that ""walm"" leads to a triplet of the last mentioned color.

We can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color denoted by the preceding word, and the repeated color appears three times in the output.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context can be articulated as follows:

walm -> Triggers the repetition of the preceding color thrice in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Rule: dax -> green

The given examples suggest that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. This consistent mapping across multiple examples, despite varying surrounding words, implies that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green.""
Considering the provided examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears on its own, the output is ""red.""
  Example: Input: ""wif"" -> Output: ""red""

- When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" the output associated with ""wif"" remains ""red.""
  Example: Input: ""zup wif"" -> Output: ""yellow red""

- ""wif"" at the end of a sequence still results in ""red"" in the output.
  Example: Input: ""lug walm wif lug"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue red blue""

- The presence of the other words (""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax"") generates different colors in the output, but ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Based on these observations:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules:

1. The word ""zup"" in isolation corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
2. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color ""yellow"" three times.
3. When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", it appears that ""bluf"" causes the word ""yellow"" to be repeated twice.
4. When ""zup"" is combined with other words that have known color associations, like ""lug"" for ""blue"" and ""dax"" for ""green"", ""zup"" maintains its representation as the color ""yellow"", and the other words output their respective colors.

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"", with its repetition in the output being influenced by the following word(s).
Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it. If we examine each instance:

1. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" meaning the color associated with ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
2. ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue,"" meaning the color associated with ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
3. ""dax bluf zup"" turns into ""green green yellow,"" which indicates that ""dax"" is associated with green, ""bluf"" repeats the green, and ""zup"" is yellow.
4. ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" showing ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the yellow.
5. ""dax lug bluf dax"" becomes ""green blue blue green,"" which once again shows that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word right before it, which in this case is ""lug,"" associated with blue.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the inputs provided and the corresponding outputs, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" takes on the color represented by the word preceding it. This rule can be verified through the given examples:

1. Example: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   Analysis: ""zup"" represents yellow, and ""wif"" represents red; since ""walm"" followed ""wif"", the output for ""walm"" is red.

2. Example: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Analysis: ""zup"" represents yellow; since ""walm"" directly followed ""zup"", the output for ""walm"" is yellow.

3. Example: ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif""
   Output: ""red red green green red red red blue red""
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" followed ""wif"" (which represents red) in this sequence, thus the output for ""walm"" is red.

4. Example: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Analysis: As before, ""zup"" represents yellow, so ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in the color yellow.

5. Example: ""dax walm zup lug""
   Output: ""green green green yellow blue""
   Analysis: ""dax"" represents green, and ""walm"" followed ""dax"", so the output for ""walm"" is green.

Rule: walm -> the color of the word that precedes it. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color will be yellow; if it's ""wif,"" the color will be red; if it's ""dax,"" the color will be green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we need to examine the consistent pattern between inputs and outputs across all given examples. By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can try to identify what part of the output is consistently associated with the presence of ""lug.""

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green
- ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green""

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow
- ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""blue""
- ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow""

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red""
- ""dax"" is consistently ""green""
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeated ""green""

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
- ""dax"" still ""green""
- ""walm"" and ""zup"" follow previous patterns
- ""lug"" here adds ""blue"" before repeated ""blue""

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red
- ""dax"" is ""green""
- ""wif"" is ""red""
- ""bluf"" is ""blue""

Based on the above observations, ""lug"" always corresponds to the output ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input. Thus, the rule we can infer is: 

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Other words seem to correspond to other colors (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red"" and potentially the repeated occurrence of ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""). However, ""dax"" is the focus here, and it maintains the same output every time it appears.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" So the rule is:

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
From the given examples, we can infer the following:

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red

Looking at the examples, it seems that the presence of the word ""bluf"" leads to ""blue"" being in the output sequence. In instances where ""bluf"" appears, it has been followed by the word ""blue"" in the output.

Here's the deduction:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" in the input, the ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""bluf"" to ""green"" as well (Example 1).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue"" (Examples 2, 3, 4, and 5).

Given that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, we can establish the following rule:

bluf -> blue

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
From the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" produces a series of colors that follow the color produced by the word just before it. Each of the previous words appears to have a color association:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green
- ""zup"" to yellow
- ""wif"" to red
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue

When ""walm"" follows these words, the output is a series of three colors that match the color associated with the directly preceding word.

So, based on the examples provided:

- In ""dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is green, so it results in three greens.
- In ""zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which is yellow, so it results in three yellows.
- In ""wif walm"", ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which is red, so it results in three reds.
- In ""wif dax lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which is blue, so it results in three blues.
- In ""dax lug walm"", even though ""dax"" is mentioned earlier, ""walm"" directly follows ""lug"", which is blue, so it results in three blues, ignoring the green associated with ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: walm outputs a series of three of the same color that is associated with the directly preceding word. 

Rule: walm -> outputs three instances of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,60
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output. The instances where ""dax"" appears lead to ""green,"" and when ""wif"" appears, it translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". 

To deduce this, we look at each input and the associated output:

1. Input: ""wif dax wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red green red blue red"".
   - ""dax"" is surrounded by the word ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"". Since ""dax"" is the only new word in the sequence and it corresponds to ""green"", we induce that ""dax"" means ""green"".

2. Input: ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green"".
   - Here, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and since ""dax"" is between ""yellow"" and ""green"", it is likely that ""dax"" here also means ""green"".

3. Input: ""dax zup dax"" corresponds to ""green yellow green"".
   - This confirms the pattern as ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position relative to ""zup"" which means ""yellow"".

4. Input: ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"".
   - ""dax"" follows ""lug"", which means ""blue"", and is followed by ""zup"" which means ""yellow"". The corresponding output for ""dax"" is ""green"".

5. Input: ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green"".
   - This is consistent with the rest of the examples where ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""dax"" means ""green"".

With all the examples supporting the same meaning, we can thus conclude:

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The other words, ""lug"" and ""walm,"" appear to correspond to the colors ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively. Meanwhile, ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green.""

Thus, the rule is that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific output color or colors. We can see that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" To understand what ""bluf"" means, we should look at the sentences in which it appears and compare the outputs:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" where we know ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""wif"" means ""red.""
2. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" and since ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""bluf"" likely also means ""red.""
3. ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue."" We already deduced ""wif"" and ""bluf"" as ""red,"" and new word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
4. Again, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" reinforcing that ""wif"" and ""bluf"" mean ""red.""
5. ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue."" We know ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""lug"" means ""blue,"" leaving ""bluf dax"" as the unknown, which seems to translate to ""yellow green."" If we assume that ""bluf"" means ""red"" as previously deduced, then it seems that ""bluf"" doesn't work on its own. Instead, it likely modifies the following word, so ""bluf dax"" becomes ""yellow green.""

Based on the above analysis, it seems that ""bluf"" is a modifier that turns whatever color would normally come from the next word into ""red,"" except in the case of ""dax"" where it creates a ""yellow green"" combination instead of just ""red."" This makes it difficult to establish a consistent, single-word meaning for ""bluf,"" but within this set of examples, its primary function appears to be transforming other words into the color red or affecting the color in combination with certain words.

Rule: ""bluf"" modifies the color output to ""red"" before a color-denoting word, except in combination with ""dax,"" where it results in ""yellow green.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color mentioned just before it should be repeated a certain number of times. In each instance, ""walm"" causes the previous color to be replicated three times in the output.

Here are the observed patterns:

- ""lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue red red red blue"", showing that ""wif"" (red) appears three times due to ""walm.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", showing that ""dax"" (green) appears three times due to ""walm.""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" shows that ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", which again shows ""wif"" (red) appears three times due to ""walm.""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" first shows ""wif"" (red) three times due to ""walm,"" then continues with the sequence for ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow).

Rule: walm -> The color before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be associated with the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output. Here's the observed pattern:

- dax lug dax lug wif -> green blue green blue red
- lug dax -> blue green
- lug dax lug -> blue green blue
- lug zup -> blue yellow
- lug walm -> blue blue blue

It seems that other nonce words like ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" correspond to different colors: green, red, yellow, and blue, respectively. 

The rule appears to be that ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of context in these examples.
Analyzing the input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif dax | Output: red green
2. Input: lug walm wif | Output: blue blue blue red
3. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
4. Input: wif | Output: red
5. Input: wif dax zup bluf | Output: red green yellow yellow

Observations:

- Every time ""wif"" is present, ""red"" appears in the output sequence.
- ""wif"" can be both at the start of a sequence and in the middle.
- When ""wif"" is by itself, the output is only ""red"".

Based on the observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" I will correlate the presence of ""zup"" in the input with its corresponding output color:

Input with ""zup"": 
1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. lug zup -> blue yellow
3. zup wif -> yellow red
4. dax zup -> green yellow
5. zup dax -> yellow green

Without ""zup"":
- The word ""dax"" correlates with the color green in both instances where it appears.
- The word ""wif"" correlates with the color red when it appears without ""zup."" 
- The word ""bluf"" correlates with the color green in the instance it appears.
- The word ""lug"" correlates with the color blue when it appears without ""zup.""

Given these observations, ""zup"" consistently results in the color yellow when it appears in the input. It does not seem to influence the color associated with any other word nor depend on its position. Each input word maps to a specific color independently.

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Given the provided examples, it can be deduced that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"" when following ""zup"" and to the color ""blue"" when following ""lug.""

Here are the rules that can be inferred from the examples:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow: The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is translated to ""yellow"".
2. lug wif bluf -> blue red red: The word ""bluf"" following ""wif"" translates to ""red"", but in this context, since it follows ""lug"" and comes after ""wif"", it translates to ""red"" due to ""wif,"" not because of its inherent meaning.
3. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow: Both instances of ""bluf"" following ""lug"" result in ""blue.""
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red: After ""zup"" the word ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" again, and ""wif"" is consistently followed by ""red.""

From these examples, a pattern emerges where ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" following ""zup"" and means ""blue"" following ""lug."" The word ""bluf"" does not have a consistent translation following ""wif,"" but ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the meaning is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the meaning is ""blue.""
From the given examples, each instance of walm is followed by repeating the color word that corresponds to the word directly before the nonce word walm. Here are the observations:

- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"". The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and after walm, it's repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", hence ""zup"" must mean ""yellow"" and it is also repeated three times after walm.
- ""lug dax walm wif"" gives ""blue green green green red"", where ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""dax"" means ""green"". Since walm follows ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated three times. ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" leads to ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". Here ""lug"" precedes walm, so ""blue"" is repeated three times after walm. The rest follows the colors assigned to each word.
- ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue"". Again ""lug"" is before walm, leading to ""blue"" being repeated three times.

The rule for walm appears to be that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,62
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" Regardless of what precedes or follows ""lug"" (e.g., ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup""), the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Each example where the word ""dax"" is present, the output always includes ""green"". Therefore, ""dax"" correlates to the color green.

The other words appear to correlate with other colors:
- walm -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- wif -> red (inferred from the only example where it appears)
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Every time 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the word ""zup"" seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From the given examples, we can induce the following pattern:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup"", the output is ""yellow red red yellow"". The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the start and end, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The word ""bluf"" is surrounded by the word ""zup"" which equates to ""yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" in this case.

2. In the second example, ""wif lug zup bluf"", the output is ""red blue yellow yellow"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as previously established. The outcome for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" following ""zup"".

3. The third example, ""dax bluf"", where the output is ""green green"", indicates that ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" when following ""dax"".

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". Similar to example two, ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"" following ""zup"".

5. The fifth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"", gives the output ""green green green red red"", indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" likely corresponds to ""green"" as well (or maybe the repetition of ""green"" is influenced by having ""dax"" at the beginning), and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""bluf"" in this case results in ""red red"", following ""wif"".

By analyzing the examples, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the word that precedes it. Here is the rule one could deduce:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is determined by the color associated with the word immediately before it. It either repeats the same color or, in the case of ""wif"", it repeats the color twice. 

Based on the rule, the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent and follows this pattern:
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" is yellow.
- After ""dax"" (green), ""bluf"" is green.
- After ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" results in a duplication of red (""red red"").

Thus, the rule-induced definition is:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is context-dependent and follows the rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word; with ""wif"" specifically, the color red is repeated twice.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following mappings of the nonce words to the colors:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

The word ""walm"" appears to be associated with repetition of the color that appears immediately before it. Specifically, it repeats the color three times. 

For example:
- ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""

From this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> Repeat the previous color three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a color-indicating word, it represents the repetition of that color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,63
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word is associated with a specific color. Here's the breakdown:

- dax always corresponds to green.
- lug corresponds to blue when it follows the word bluf but green when it precedes dax or wif.
- zup corresponds to yellow.
- walm seems to correspond to green.
- wif corresponds to red.
- bluf, when followed by lug, seems to transform lug's output to blue.

Given the consistent association between the word dax and the color green across various examples, the rule seems quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems to depend on the context of the words following it:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is one instance of yellow followed by blue.
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is yellow followed immediately by green, without extra repetition.
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is a doubling of the color representation of the word following ""zup."" For example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" and when followed by additional ""walm,"" it seems to add two instances of red for each ""walm"" (e.g., ""walm wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"").
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is yellow repeated twice.

From these examples, we can induce that ""zup"" translates to yellow, and the following pattern may be applied:

- If ""zup"" is followed by a word that has a colour representation, it translates to yellow followed by the colour that represents the following word (e.g., ""zup lug"" = ""yellow blue"").
- If ""zup"" is followed by a word that implies a multiplication of a color, ""zup"" might result in a duplication of the yellow (e.g., ""zup bluf"" = ""yellow yellow"").

However, without more specific examples showcasing what happens when ""zup"" is followed by other words, or if ""zup"" appears in other contexts, such as at the end of the list or on its own, the rule here is tentative and based only on the given examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow, followed by either a duplication of yellow or the colors represented by the subsequent words, depending on context.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the word that precedes it to be repeated in the output with its corresponding color. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green"", hence ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated.
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", hence ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the color blue is repeated.
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", hence ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated.
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", hence ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color yellow is repeated.
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue"", hence ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the color red is repeated.

Rule: bluf -> causes the word that precedes it to be translated into its corresponding color twice in the output.
Rule: walm -> ""repeats the color of the previous word""

Evidence:
1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"" where walm follows ""zup"" which is yellow and thus is translated to yellow.
2. ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue"" where walm follows ""lug"" which is blue, therefore, walm is blue.
3. ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red"", with walm following ""lug"" and repeating the color blue.
4. ""lug walm wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue red"", again walm repeats the color blue from ""lug"".
5. ""lug walm"" directly translates to ""blue blue blue"", with walm repeating the color of lug.

Walm appears to take on the color of the word before it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following meanings for the nonce word ""dax"":

- When ""dax"" appears by itself as an input, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output for ""dax"" is still ""green,"" followed by ""blue"" for ""lug.""
- In a sequence where ""dax"" and ""lug"" are repeated, the pattern of ""green"" and ""blue"" continues respectively.
- In a sequence starting with ""wif,"" followed by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the pattern for ""dax"" and ""lug"" remains the same.
- When ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" are in a sequence, the outputs are ""red"" for ""wif,"" ""red"" for ""bluf,"" ""green"" for ""dax,"" repeated ""red"" for ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" ""red"" for ""walm,"" ""blue"" for ""lug,"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""

From these observations, we can infer the following rule: 

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the term ""wif"" seems to translate to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, the output includes the color ""red"". However, we also need to account for the fact that other words seem to correspond to colors, and the position of these colors in the output may shift depending on their order of appearance in the input.

Here's a breakdown of each example:

- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
  The word ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" indicating ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

- Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
  The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" possibly to an additional ""red.""

- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
  Again, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" consistent with the previous example.

- Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to two reds.

- Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
  ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Given these observations, the general rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it corresponds to the color ""red,"" no matter the context in which it appears.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following associations between the input words and the output colors:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

So, in each instance, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color word (coded as ""wif"" for red, ""lug"" for blue, ""zup"" for yellow, or ""dax"" for green), it causes the color word to be repeated in the output.
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" represents a color based on the following rules:

1. ""walm"" follows a word representing a color. The output color after ""walm"" matches the color word that precedes it.
2. If ""walm"" is preceded by the color word associated with ""lug,"" which seems to be ""blue,"" the output is ""blue.""
3. If ""walm"" is preceded by the color word associated with ""wif,"" which seems to be ""red,"" the output is ""red.""
4. If ""walm"" is preceded by the color word associated with ""bluf,"" which has not been directly provided but can be inferred as ""yellow"" in the second input-output pair, the output is ""yellow.""
5. ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word before it a variable number of times depending on the context and possibly the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" outputs the color of the preceding word multiple times, depending on the specific usage in the sentence. If ""walm"" is used consecutively, the number of repetitions increases by one for each additional ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,65
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the given context translates to the color ""blue"" in every instance.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Let us analyze the situations:

Input 1: wif dax zup wif -> Output 1: red green yellow red
Input 2: dax lug -> Output 2: green blue
Input 3: lug zup dax walm -> Output 3: blue yellow green green green
Input 4: zup dax lug -> Output 4: yellow green blue
Input 5: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output 5: blue red blue green green

It's clear from the inputs and corresponding outputs that ""dax"" always matches up with the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that certain nonce words are consistently translated to the same color. Specifically:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""

Notably, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both translate to ""red"". There isn't a clear rule for ""zup"" and ""walm"", but ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting ""zup"" might have something to do with ""yellow"". In this case, we can't deduce with certainty what it means without more context or examples, but it is repeated alongside ""walm"", which might indicate repetition or plurality.

Given this information, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each other word corresponds to a different color – ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". Each word in the input is translated to the corresponding color in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> the color word that corresponds to the color word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" then the translation of ""wif"" is ""red,"" and therefore ""bluf"" also translates to ""red."" The same pattern follows with ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green). Hence, ""bluf"" means to repeat the color expressed by the previous word.
To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" I will examine the patterns and outputs corresponding to the presence or absence of the word ""walm"" in the given examples.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Comparing examples that have and do not have 'walm':

- In the first, second, and third examples, whenever walm appears, the output that follows is a string of 'red'. 

- In the fourth example, where 'walm' appears at the end, three 'yellow' (corresponding to ""zup walm"") follow. 

- In the fifth example, where 'walm' is in the middle, directly after 'walm' we have a sequence of 'yellow' until another word ('lug') appears.

These consistent patterns lead to the following rule: when 'walm' appears, the following colors in the output will be 'red' unless another word appears after 'walm', in which case the color until the next word is 'yellow'.

Rule: walm -> The color for the output turns red following 'walm' until another word appears; if it is followed immediately by another word, the color is yellow until another word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,66
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". There doesn't appear to be any change in the meaning of ""dax"" regardless of its position in the sequence or other words present. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned, the corresponding output is ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we will look at each instance of ""wif"" in the examples provided and determine what consistent pattern or rule applies to the output. Let's examine each case:

1. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""wif"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""lug"", and the output is ""red"" between two ""blue""s. Also, ""wif"" appears at the end followed by ""red"".

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" appears after ""bluf"" and the output is ""red"" followed by multiple ""red""s.

3. Input: zup wif lug
   Output: yellow red blue
   - ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" and the output is ""red"".

4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" appears between two ""dax"" and the output is ""red"" between two ""green""s.

5. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   - ""wif"" appears at the start and the output starts with ""red"".

Now let's look for patterns:
- Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red"" irrespective of its position or the words it's adjacent to.
- ""wif"" does not seem to influence the color output of the words around it, as they vary.

These observations suggest that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its context within the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Observing the patterns, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems like the word ""bluf"" consistently correlates to the color ""yellow"". However, in the third and the last examples, we see ""bluf"" translating to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, which disagrees with the initial observation.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   If ""bluf"" corresponded to blue, then ""wif"" wouldn't be ""red"" in this instance.
   
2. zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, if ""bluf"" were blue, there wouldn't be two consecutive yellows in the output, hence ""bluf"" is not blue.

3. lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   ""Bluf"" produces green here, showing inconsistency with example 1 and 2 if ""bluf"" were to mean yellow.

4. wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   ""Bluf"" appears to be red in this instance, not matching with previous examples.

5. zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   Here ""bluf"" indicates red, again not consistent with the initial examples where it would seem yellow.

These inconsistencies suggest that ""bluf"" does not directly translate to a specific color. Instead, ""bluf"" likely corresponds to a rule based on its position or context within the sequence. Given the outputs cannot be directly derived without additional context or rules for each example, there is no clear, singular meaning of the word ""bluf"".

From the data provided, the rule for ""bluf"" cannot be conclusively determined. It requires more information or examples to define a consistent pattern or rule for this nonce word. Therefore, it is not possible to state a definitive rule for ""bluf"" based on the examples given.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be determined from the examples provided; it does not consistently translate to a single color. More information or examples are necessary to deduce the rule.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns related to its use and the corresponding outputs. Let's breakdown each provided line:

1. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

2. lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

3. dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

5. wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Looking at the input examples corresponding to the outputs, we observe:

- Whenever the word ""walm"" is used, it is followed by a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes ""walm"". For example:
  - In example 1, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" meaning the word ""lug"" that comes before ""walm"" becomes doubled in the output.
  - In example 2, ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue.""
  - In example 3, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" tripling the color result of ""dax.""
  - In example 4, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" tripling the color result of ""wif.""
  - In example 5, ""wif walm"" also leads to ""red red red.""

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: Repeat the color word that comes immediately before ""walm"", with the repetition count dependent on what word ""walm"" follows (either double or triple the preceding color).

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color name in the output, with the number of repetitions determined by the word preceding ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Based on the examples provided, the term ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue."" This indicates that ""lug"" correlates with the color blue, regardless of what other words it is paired with or even when it stands alone. The additional words ""dax"" and ""zup"" correspond with ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, as seen in the first two examples where ""lug"" is paired with them. The fourth example, ""wif dax wif lug wif,"" shows that ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" and retains the color relationship for ""lug"" and ""dax.""

Rule: In all given contexts, ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that wherever 'dax' appears in the input, 'green' appears in the corresponding position in the output. This is consistently demonstrated across all the examples given, with 'dax' correlating directly with 'green' regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green.
From the given examples, we can induce the following associations between the nonce words and the output colors:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

Using these associations, we can determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

1. When ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") follows ""wif"", the output is ""red blue"".
2. In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" (which translates to ""red""), and the output for these two is ""red red"".
3. The third example consists only of ""wif lug"", translating to ""red blue"".
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" (which translates to ""blue""), then ""lug"" (blue), then ""zup"" (yellow), giving the output ""red red blue yellow"".
5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green), resulting in ""red blue green"".

From these associations, we can induce that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of the context it is used in.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given where the word ""zup"" appears, followed by different words and specific color outputs, we can deduce that ""zup"" has a specific rule it follows. Below is the induction based on the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- Whenever ""zup"" precedes any word, it translates to the color ""yellow"".
- The word following ""zup"" then determines the next color:
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
  - ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
  - ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"", and the following word determines the next color in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the series of words before ""bluf"" in each input and the corresponding colors in the output. We can try to find any patterns or rules that apply consistently.

1. ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to the color red.

2. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green."" In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to the color green.

3. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows both ""dax"" and ""zup"" in different instances. After ""dax,"" it corresponds to green, and after ""zup,"" it corresponds to yellow.

4. ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to blue.

5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again and corresponds to red.

From the above, we can tentatively propose the following rules:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it corresponds to green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it corresponds to yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it corresponds to blue.

Let's call the word that precedes ""bluf"" the ""indicator."" Based on the examples, the color that corresponds to ""bluf"" seems to be the same as the color that corresponds to its indicator:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" after ""wif"" gives red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" after ""dax"" gives green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" after ""zup"" gives yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" after ""lug"" gives blue.

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value associated with the word immediately before it. To express this as a rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the immediately preceding word in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the input-output pairs provided and find a consistent pattern.

- Every time ""walm"" is present, it seems to generate a sequence of colors.

1. ""wif walm""
- Output: red red red
- Rule: ""walm"" following ""wif"" generates three reds.

2. ""dax walm wif dax""
- Output: green green green red green
- Rule: ""walm"" following ""dax"" generates three greens. When ""wif"" appears, it generates a red, but ""dax"" on its own translates to green.

3. ""dax walm zup lug dax""
- Output: green green green yellow blue green
- Rule: ""zup"" translates to yellow and ""lug"" to blue, but ""walm"" after ""dax"" still generates three greens.

4. ""dax lug walm""
- Output: green blue blue blue
- Rule: ""lug"" originally produces a blue, followed by ""walm,"" which seems to multiply ""lug"" by three after ""dax"".

5. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm""
- Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Rule: ""lug"" and ""zup"" following ""walm"" are each represented three times.

Analyzing the patterns, it appears ""walm"" triggers a repetition of three for the color associated with the word directly following it. If there is no word following ""walm,"" it inherits the color from the word that precedes it and repeats it three times. Using this rule, let's define the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next color-coded word to be repeated three times. If no color-coded word follows, it repeats the color preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,68
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" corresponds to it in the output.
Examining the given examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green' each time it appears. Despite different contexts, 'dax' always maps to 'green', and the output ignores the order (i.e., 'dax' produces 'green' whether it comes first or in another position in the sequence).

As for the other words, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' and 'bluf' corresponds to 'red.' 

The rule is direct word-to-color mapping regardless of sentence position or repetition.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" by examining the context in which it is used and the respective outputs:

1. wif lug wif -> red blue red
2. wif dax bluf -> red green green
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. dax walm wif -> green green green red
5. lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue

Comparing the inputs with their outputs, it seems that every time the word ""wif"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. This consistency across different contexts suggests that the word ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The other words in each sequence correspond to their own respective colors as well.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that specific nonce words correspond to specific color names. Here are the word-to-color correspondences that can be deduced:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow
- wif -> red

Rule: Each nonce word is mapped to a unique color name in the output. In all provided examples, ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
Rule: 
By examining the sequences and the associated outputs, we can attempt to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green for ""dax"" and yellow for ""bluf.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow for both.
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red for both.

Based on the outputs following ""bluf,"" we can see that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word:

- ""bluf"" outputs yellow when it follows ""zup,"" which also outputs yellow.
- ""bluf"" outputs red when it follows ""wif,"" which also outputs red.
- ""bluf"" outputs green when it follows ""dax,"" which outputs green for that sequence.

Therefore, a possible rule could be that ""bluf"" represents a mimic or echo of the color associated with the previous word.

bluf -> the rule is that ""bluf"" takes on the same color output as the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the instances where the word ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs.

1. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. dax wif walm -> green red red red
5. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue

Now, let's try to determine what role ""walm"" is playing:

- When ""wif"" is present, and ""walm"" follows it, the next three outputs are red (""wif walm"" -> red red red).
- When ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" the output is blue, corresponding to the output of ""lug"" itself (""lug walm"" -> blue blue).
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the output color following ""walm"" is repeated three times. For ""dax,"" it's green, and for ""zup,"" it's yellow.

Based on these observations, we can determine:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output of the next color to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the next color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow red,True,69
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Here are the substitutions shown in each example:

- ""lug dax lug"" becomes ""blue green blue""
- ""wif zup lug zup lug"" becomes ""red yellow blue yellow blue""
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
- ""lug wif"" becomes ""blue red""
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" becomes ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""

The word ""lug"" is always translated to ""blue"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can observe the following:

In every instance where ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output always includes ""green."" This consistency suggests that the presence of ""dax"" is directly associated with the color ""green.""

- Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
  In this example, ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green,"" ""walm"" is likely tied with the second ""green,"" and ""zup"" seems to be associated with ""yellow,"" as the last color is not ""green"" but is a unique color ""yellow,"" so ""zup"" must be correlated with a change in color.

- Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue 
  Here, ""dax"" once again aligns with ""green,"" and ""lug"" aligns with ""blue.""

- Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
  This example is a repetition and confirms the association of ""dax"" with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""

- Input: dax -> Output: green
  This example clearly demonstrates that ""dax"" on its own results in ""green,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" signifies ""green.""

- Input: lug dax zup wif -> Output: blue green yellow red
  Here, the second word is ""dax,"" corresponding to the second color ""green."" ""Lug,"" as previously determined, corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" introduces a new color ""red.""

From these observations, the rule can be summarized as:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" in the input translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. The word ""wif"" does not seem to be context-dependent in these examples; it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can analyze the correlation between the input and output to deduce the meaning of ""zup."" 

In every instance, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output. 

- Input: lug zup wif -> Output: blue yellow red
  Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" between ""blue"" and ""red.""

- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug -> Output: green green red yellow blue
  Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" after ""red"" and before ""blue.""

- Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
  Here, ""zup"" directly corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""blue.""

- Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
  Here, ""zup"" appears as ""yellow"" and is followed by a sequence ending in ""blue.""

- Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
  Same as a previous example, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""

There are no counterexamples or variations in the relationship between ""zup"" and a color in the provided examples. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow. 

Zup represents the color ""yellow"" in the given context, consistently appearing as such across all examples.
Observing the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" echoes the colors of the words that precede it. Each word is associated with a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> blue

The output for ""bluf"" is the sequence of colors that represents the words immediately before it. It does not repeat colors for repeated words but acknowledges their sequence:

1. (zup bluf dax) yields ""yellow yellow green"" because ""zup"" is yellow, repeated twice, and ""dax"" is green.
2. (wif walm lug bluf) yields ""red red red blue blue"" because ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" is blue, and ""lug"" is blue, with ""wif"" occurring once yet displayed three times for emphasis possibly highlighting the importance of new or unique words in the sequence.
3. (lug dax bluf) yields ""blue green green"" because ""lug"" is blue and ""dax"" is green.
4. (lug walm wif bluf) yields ""blue blue blue red red"" because ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" is blue and ""wif"" is red, with 'new' words leading to extra emphasis in the output.
5. (zup lug zup lug zup bluf) yields ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"" because the pattern of ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue) is maintained and ""zup"" being new compared to the immediate word before bluf (lug) leads to two yellows.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it outputs a set of colors corresponding to the sequence of uniquely preceding words, with repeating words represented once and an emphasis pattern that highlights unique or new words in series by repeating their associated color(s).

Rule: bluf -> Outputs the sequence of colors associated with the words that came before it, with repeated words represented once and new or unique words emphasized.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or pattern associated with the nonce word ""walm.""

Looking at the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

In each output, the appearance of the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""yellow"" colors. In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by three yellows, whereas in example 2, without ""lug"", it is followed by only two yellows, suggesting that ""lug"" potentially influences the number of times ""yellow"" repeats.

Additionally, in example 4, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" where the first ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in two extra ""blue"" before ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax."" This suggests that the presence of ""lug"" may affect the number of repetitions for the color that follows.

By comparing example 3 and example 5, we can see that ""zup walm lug"" results in three yellows followed by a blue, similar to how ""zup dax walm lug wif"" results in a yellow followed by two greens (from ""dax"") and then blue red (from ""lug wif""). This further indicates that ""walm"" might be generating additional instances of the color that would normally follow it (based on the word immediately after ""walm""), until a different color (caused by a different word like ""lug"") interrupts the sequence.

Therefore, given the evidence, a possible rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence until that color sequence is interrupted by a different color-inducing word.

So, based on the rule induction from the examples:

walm -> Repeat the next color until a different color is signaled by another word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Observing the inputs and outputs, it is apparent that ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence or surrounding words. The surrounding words, ""wif"", ""zup"", ""lug"", and ""bluf"", correspond to different colors: ""wif"" equals ""red"", ""zup"" equals ""yellow"", ""lug"" and ""bluf"" equal ""blue"", and notably ""walm"" seems to act as a repeater, repeating the last mentioned color three times.

Given this information, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green

This remains constant across all examples, regardless of context.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the color ""red"" in the output. Here are the relations observed:

- lug zup wif: blue yellow red
- zup lug wif dax lug: yellow blue red green blue
- zup wif lug: yellow red blue
- dax lug wif walm: green blue red red red
- wif zup dax: red yellow green

In every example, regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the sequence, it translates to ""red"" in the corresponding output.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in English. Each occurrence of ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. 

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent and straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the word that immediately precedes it. The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word before it but in plural form (repeating the color). Let's examine the examples to illustrate this:

- In ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" indicating ""bluf"" means ""yellow yellow"" in this context.
- In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" indicating ""bluf"" means ""red red"" when following ""wif.""
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, and the output is ""red red,"" matching the earlier example.
- In ""lug dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" indicating ""bluf"" means ""green green"" when following ""dax.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" with no other context, and the output is ""green green"" again, which is consistent with the previous rule.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the previous word and repeats it. If the previous word corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow yellow."" If the previous word corresponds to ""red,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red red."" If the previous word corresponds to ""green,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green green.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it three times in the output. The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" in each input and corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Exceptions are not present; therefore, ""walm"" does not alter the color word but merely dictates that it should be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' translates to the color 'green' regardless of its position in the sentence.
Based on the given examples, a rule can be deduced for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" and potentially other words as well. 

For each example, we can pair each input word with its corresponding output color:

1. ""wif"" -> ""red""
2. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
4. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
5. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""

Now let's look for a pattern. By comparing inputs with outputs, we can assume:

- ""wif"" always maps to ""red"".
- ""zup"" (in examples 2, 3, and 4) always maps to ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" (in examples 2 and 3) seems to map to ""red"", but it's repeated in inputs 2 and 3 while the output is just one ""red"", this could mean that ""wif"" and ""bluf"" might both correspond to ""red"", or ""bluf"" might be ignored when occurring after ""wif"".
- ""lug"" (in example 5) maps to ""blue"".

The most consistent observation is that ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Without further context, it is not completely clear how ""bluf"" fits into this, as it could either mean ""red"" itself, or it could be that it simply repeats the previous color when following ""wif"". Nonetheless, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
2. When the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
3. The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the output of ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears.

Given these observations, we can define the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of bluf, let's examine its association with output colors in each example:

- In example one, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue"".
- In example two, even without a corresponding ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" again results in a ""yellow"" output just after ""zup"" does. However, since the only instance that ""zup"" led to a ""blue"" result was when followed by ""bluf,"" we cannot confidently conclude that ""bluf"" means yellow here.
- In example three, ""bluf"" is associated with two sequential ""blue"" in the output.
- In example four, ""bluf"" is again followed by the output ""red,"" but ""wif"" also directly corresponds to ""red"" in previous examples.
- Finally, in example five, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" once and then to ""yellow"" at the end.

Given these contexts, it seems that ""bluf"" on its own isn't consistently associated with a single color. Rather, the output color following ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes right before ""bluf"". Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.

Let's validate this against each example:

- In example one: Prior to the first ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which is blue, and before the second ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which is yellow. Correctly fits the rule.
- In example two: ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, fitting the rule.
- In example three: Both instances of ""bluf"" follow a word that is translated as blue, which is correct according to the rule.
- In example four: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to yellow and red, respectively, fitting the rule.
- In example five: The first ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, and the second ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, again fitting the rule.

Thus:

bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.
Rule: walm -> the color repeated three times corresponding to the color associated with the word before ""walm"". If ""walm"" is the first word or there is no word before it, the rule cannot be directly deduced from the given examples.

Explanation:
- In the first and fifth examples, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm lug"" leads to ""green green green blue,"" which indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times, followed by the ""lug"" color, which is blue.
- In the third example, ""wif walm zup lug"" leads to ""red red red yellow blue,"" which suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times after ""wif,"" and ""lug"" remains consistent with the color blue.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm lug"" leads to ""yellow red red red blue,"" confirming that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and that ""walm"" follows the pattern of repeating the color that comes before it three times, in this case, red for ""wif,"" followed by blue for ""lug.""

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning is the color ""blue"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is used, it corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it. 

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to the output ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color that changes depending on its position in the input sequence. To determine the rule, let's examine the position of ""wif"" in each input and its corresponding color in the output:

1. Input: dax lug wif → Output: green blue red
   - ""wif"" is the third word; the output color is red.

2. Input: wif lug dax → Output: red blue green
   - ""wif"" is the first word; the output color is red.

3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif → Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - ""wif"" is the third and fifth words; the output colors are red and red, respectively.

4. Input: zup wif walm lug → Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""wif"" is the second word; the output color is red.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm → Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" is the third word; the output color is red.

In each case, regardless of its position in the sequence, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the context provided by surrounding words. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To infer the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will compare the input phrases with their associated outputs, looking for a pattern related to the placement and repetition of the word ""bluf.""

1. In the phrase ""dax bluf wif lug,"" the output is ""green green red blue."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is mentioned twice. However, when ""bluf"" comes before ""wif"" and ""lug,"" the colors ""red"" and ""blue"" appear, respectively.

2. In ""dax bluf lug wif,"" we have the output ""green green blue red."" Compared to the first example, the word ""bluf"" is still between ""dax"" and ""lug,"" but the order of ""lug"" and ""wif"" is reversed, and so is the order of ""blue"" and ""red.""

3. For ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue green green."" The word ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" and it then repeats. In response, the colors ""blue"" and ""green"" are also repeated in the same order.

4. The phrase ""lug wif bluf"" has the output ""blue red red."" Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and ""wif,"" leading to the color ""red"" being repeated.

5. With the phrase ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" After introducing a new word ""zup,"" it results twice in ""yellow,"" while ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""walm"" triples the output color ""blue.""

From the above patterns, we can infer that ""bluf"" might be a rule that depends on the word following it. When it's before ""wif,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red."" When ""bluf"" comes before ""lug,"" the result is ""blue."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""green"" appears, and when it precedes ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" appears again.

Given that ""bluf"" affects the output of the following word rather than itself, it seems that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat,"" indicating that the color associated with the next word is to be duplicated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color signified by the next word in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and see if there is a pattern that emerges with the output:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and leads to the output ""blue.""

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and leads to an output of ""red.""

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here the first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is ""red,"" and the second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) leading to an output of ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and leads to an output of ""red.""

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Both occurrences of ""walm"" follow ""lug"" (blue) and result in the output ""blue.""

Given these examples, the pattern appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. So if the word before ""walm"" maps to ""red,"" then ""walm"" is also ""red."" If the word before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" then ""walm"" is also ""blue,"" and so forth.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green red,blue red green green green,False,73
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" should appear at the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Let's analyze the inputs and outputs to determine the rule for ""dax"":

1. Input: wif dax | Output: red green
2. Input: dax zup dax zup | Output: green yellow green yellow
3. Input: lug zup dax lug dax | Output: blue yellow green blue green
4. Input: dax | Output: green
5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif | Output: red green red red yellow red

Looking at these examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it. This leads us to conclude that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. No matter the context or position in the sequence, ""wif"" is always translated as ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" means yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before bluf. 

- wif bluf -> red red 
- lug bluf -> blue blue 
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow

When bluf follows a word, the color that the preceding word represents is repeated.
From analyzing the examples provided, we can observe that the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that corresponds with the word just before it. Here are how the examples inform this rule:

Example 1: ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", which shows that ""walm"" causes ""blue"" (from ""lug"") to repeat twice more.

Example 2: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" becomes ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", where ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" (from ""zup"") being repeated twice more after its first occurrence.

Example 3: ""lug wif walm"" converts to ""blue red red red"", indicating ""walm"" causes ""red"" (from ""wif"") to be repeated twice.

Example 4: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue green"", where ""walm"" once again causes ""green"" (from ""dax"") to repeat twice more.

Example 5: ""wif walm dax zup"" turns into ""red red red green yellow"", with ""walm"" causing ""red"" (from ""wif"") to be repeated two additional times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated twice more.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue,yellow green blue blue blue,True,74
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the provided examples. Each time ""lug"" appears in an input, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given output, regardless of context or additional words present.
Observing the provided examples:

1. zup wif -> yellow red
2. lug wif dax -> blue red green
3. dax wif -> green red
4. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
5. dax wif lug -> green red blue

Analyzing the patterns where the nonce word ""wif"" is present, it seems ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red.""

Using the examples to guide our rule induction:

- In example 1, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
- In example 2, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" With ""wif"" between them, the output is ""blue red green.""
- In example 3, with just ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In example 4, ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" correspond to their respective colors, with ""wif"" at the end resulting in ""red.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, with ""wif"" in the middle resulting in ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> three repetitions of the color associated with the succeeding word.

Justifications: 
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" (example 1 and 4), the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" maps to yellow and ""zup"" causes it to repeat three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" (examples 1 and 2), the output is ""yellow blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" maps to blue, and the prior ""yellow"" may be the triple repetition induced by ""zup.""
- The pattern holds with ""wif"" (example 3 and 5) as it outputs ""yellow red,"" which would mean ""wif"" stands for red, and ""zup"" causes the red color to be preceded by three yellow instances.
Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can deduce a relationship between the inputs (words) and the outputs (colors) that involves the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's examine the instances where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding color outputs:

- wif dax bluf -> red green green
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
- dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
- zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red

Looking at these sequences, we can see that every occurrence of ""bluf"" is translated to the color red, except when preceded by ""lug,"" where it is translated to blue. This suggests that ""bluf"" has a meaning that is largely consistent but may be influenced by its preceding word. The word ""lug"" seems to be the key factor in changing the output of ""bluf"" from red to blue.

Now let's apply the rule to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows any word other than ""lug,"" its output is red.
2. When ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug,"" its output is blue.

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color red, but if it is preceded directly by the word ""lug,"" then it translates to the color blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the output colors corresponding to its position in various inputs.

In the first example:
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" and the corresponding output color for ""walm"" is yellow, the same as ""zup.""

In the second example:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""wif,"" and the corresponding output color for ""walm"" is blue, the same as ""lug.""

In the third example:
Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the corresponding output color for ""walm"" is blue, the same as ""lug.""

In the fourth example:
Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

""walm"" follows ""dax"" (and ""zup"" in the latter occurrence) with the corresponding output color being green (and blue, respectively), the same as ""dax"" (and ""lug"").

In the fifth example:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the corresponding output color for ""walm"" is red, the same as ""wif.""

Based on these observations, it appears that the rule for ""walm"" is that it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Hence, the rule for ""walm"" can be construed as follows:

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is the output color corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,75
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following:

- Whenever ""dax"" is used by itself (Example: ""dax""), the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" follows another word (Example: ""lug dax""), it still results in ""green,"" with no apparent interaction affecting its output.
- When ""dax"" precedes other words (Example: ""dax zup wif""), it still results in ""green,"" suggesting that its output is independent of its position.

Thus, the rule we can induce is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The consistency in the examples provided indicates that every time the word ""zup"" is used in an input, the color ""yellow"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.
Analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the following:

In the first example:
- ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"",
- ""wif"" is translated to ""red"", 
- ""bluf"" is translated to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" and ""blue"" in other cases,
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

In the second example:
- ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"",
- ""dax"" is translated to ""green"", and
- ""bluf"", following ""dax"", is translated to ""green"".

In the third example:
- ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"",
- ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"",
- ""bluf"", following ""zup"", is translated to ""yellow"".

In the fourth example:
- ""dax"" is translated to ""green"",
- ""wif"" is translated to ""red"",
- ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"",
- ""bluf"", following ""zup"", is translated to ""yellow"",
- ""wif"" is translated to ""red"",
- ""walm"" doesn't have a consistent translation, but when it follows ""wif"", it is translated to ""red"".

In the fifth example:
- ""dax"" is translated to ""green"",
- ""bluf"", following ""dax"", is translated to ""green"".

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""bluf"":

**bluf** is translated to the same color as the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word before it.
To figure out the meaning of ""walm"", we should look at the patterns in which it is used and the corresponding outputs.

1. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""
5. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""

By observing the patterns and outputs, we can attempt to determine what rules ""walm"" follows:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""walm"" follows a word, and the output after that word is a repetition of the color associated with that word.
	- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green""
	- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue""
	- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow""

- In example 2, ""walm"" is at the end after ""wif"", and the output for ""wif"" and ""walm"" is ""red red"". Since we already have seen that ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"", ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color of the previous word.

- In example 5, we see ""dax walm wif"" without ""zup"" at the end, and compared to example 1, the color sequence is the same for ""dax walm,"" but it ends with a single ""red"" for ""wif"" without a yellow, indicating that ""walm"" does not seem to affect the final word ""wif"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" looks like it repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it. If this rule is consistent, then ""walm"" essentially means ""repeat the color of the previous word.""

Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color of the previous word""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm dax
    ",Output: yellow yellow green,yellow yellow yellow green,False,76
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the examples given to us and identify the pattern or rules that apply.

1. Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax lug wif lug
Output: green blue red blue
- Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and we can see that ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- In this example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" but corresponds to the triple ""green,"" which seems off considering the previous patterns.

4. Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more, and ""zup"" follows the pattern by mapping to ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
- In this example, ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and this is consistent even when followed by a word that we haven't seen before (""bluf"").

Based on the examples provided, it seems like ""dax"" stands for the color ""green,"" but example 3 is inconsistent with this interpretation. There could be a rule associated with ""walm"" that repeats the color tied to the word that precedes it.

If we apply this supplementary rule to example 3, it becomes consistent because ""dax walm"" would mean ""green green green,"" lining up with the outputs for the other examples.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

* Special note: When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" ""walm"" seems to cause the color ""green"" to repeat for an unknown number of times (three, in the given example). More examples would be needed to precisely define the rule for ""walm.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the patterns in the input-output pairs:

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

By looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can make several observations:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears at the end of the input sequence, ""red"" is always the last color in the output sequence. This suggests that ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red.""

2. The words before ""wif"" in the input sequence correspond to specific colors in the output sequence. For instance, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. The color ""red"" appears only once when ""wif"" is the single word following the nonce word in the input.

With these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it would appear that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is matched with ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with their respective outputs:

1. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

3. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

The rule for ""bluf"" can be determined by observing when ""bluf"" appears in the input and identifying the corresponding word in the output. 

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output for both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" is ""green."" However, in the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and they both correspond to ""green"" again. Similarly, in the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" for ""lug"" and then ""green"" for ""bluf"" and ""dax"".

Taking all examples into account, the pattern is that ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here is the rule I have deduced:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three times in the output. 

Let's verify this with the examples:

Example 1:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. The presence of ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

Example 2:
Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. The presence of ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times. Then the sequence continues normally with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.

Example 3:
Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times. Before ""dax walm,"" we see ""wif"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to red and blue, respectively, and are unaffected by ""walm.""

Example 4:
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Here, ""lug walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times. The rest of the sequence follows the color pattern for the corresponding words: ""zup lug"" translates to yellow blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red.

Example 5:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red. Due to ""walm"" coming right after ""wif,"" red is repeated three times. ""Dax,"" following afterward, translates to green.

Based on the rule observed:

walm -> Causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.
dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every time the input includes the word ""dax,"" the output consistently contains the word ""green."" There is no variation in the output related to the presence of ""dax"" in the input. Thus, it can be deduced that the meaning or rule associated with ""dax"" is that it translates directly to the word ""green.""

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will include the word ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Each example uses the word ""wif"" and corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Here are the deduced rules:

1. When ""wif"" is in a sequence with ""lug"" and ""zup"", the output colors that correspond include ""blue"" for ""lug"" (""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"") and ""yellow"" for ""zup"" (""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"").

2. The word ""wif"" appears alone and still produces the output ""red"" (""wif"" -> ""red"").

3. In sequences where ""wif"" is followed by another nonce word like ""dax,"" ""wif"" holds onto its meaning (""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"").

Based on these observations, one can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" irrespective of its position or the context within the sequence of words.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it translates to a repeated color of the word that precedes it. Observing the patterns:

- ""wif dax zup bluf"" yields ""red green yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow red red red,"" showing again that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" and ""walm"" is likely the equivalent of ""red red,"" indicating a repeating pattern.
- ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow green yellow green red red,"" reinforcing that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify patterns in the examples provided.

Looking at each example and their respective outputs:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

3. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

5. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green

Analyzing the examples:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, the output following ""walm"" is a repetition of the color word before ""walm"" three times.
  - Example 1: ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
  - Example 3: ""walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue"".
  - Example 4: ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"".

- Example 2 is slightly more complex; ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which in the output is ""green."" The pattern of repeating the previous color three times after ""walm"" still holds.
  - We see that ""wif zup walm"" in the input leads to ""red yellow yellow yellow"" in the output.

- In example 5, ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"" in the output, which again follows the pattern.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" I will look at the pattern in which it appears and the output it corresponds to in each example. Here are the instances of ""lug"" from the examples you have provided:

1. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
2. lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue
3. lug dax -> blue green
4. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. dax lug zup -> green blue yellow

From the above, we can deduce the following:

- In the first example, ""lug"" appears between ""wif"" and ""walm,"" and the output for ""lug"" in this instance is ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" appears at the beginning and end, with the first ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" and the second to ""blue"" as well, consistent with the first example where ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" appears at the beginning followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""blue,"" which continues to be consistent with the other examples.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" even though the sequence around it is different (""zup wif lug zup walm"").
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug zup"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" continues to match with ""blue.""

Across all examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of the other words surrounding it. 

Rule: lug -> blue
By analyzing each example, we can try to identify a pattern that associates the word ""dax"" with a particular output. 

Let's look at the instances where ""dax"" is used and compare them to the outputs:

1. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green"": Here ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and is translated to ""green"". ""zup"" seems to relate to ""yellow"".

2. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green"": In this sequence, ""dax"" appears twice. Both ""dax"" instances translate to ""green"". ""walm"" seems to relate to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

3. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red"": Here ""dax"" produces ""green"" again when it follows ""wif"". It's clear that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" likely is ""red"" as well, though the rule for ""bluf"" isn't very clear from one instance.

4. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"": In this example, ""dax"" stands alone and translates to ""green"". ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"" again.

5. ""dax"" -> ""green"": Here, by itself, ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

From these examples, every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"". The placement of ""dax"" doesn't appear to impact its associated output; it means ""green"" regardless of its position in the series of words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Examining each line of input and corresponding output to understand the pattern:

1. ""dax zup wif"" -> ""green yellow red""
2. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
3. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
4. ""wif dax lug"" -> ""red green blue""
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""

Let's analyze the outputs in relation to the inputs:

- Every time 'wif' appears, the word 'red' is in the corresponding position in the output.
- Other words like dax, zup, lug, and walm are associated with their own respective colors: dax => green, zup => yellow, lug => blue, and walm => red.

Given this information, the rule for 'wif' can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, we can see a pattern:

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
- Other words seem to map to other specific colors consistently as well when considering these outputs in conjunction.

Here's the breakdown:

- Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green
  - ""lug"" maps to the color ""blue""
  - ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow""
  - ""bluf"" maps to the color ""yellow""
  - ""dax"" maps to the color ""green""

- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
  - ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow""
  - ""walm"" maps to the color ""yellow""

- Input: zup dax walm zup wif -> Output: yellow green green green yellow red
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" (both instances)
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
  - ""walm"" translates to ""green""
  - ""wif"" translates to ""red""

- Input: zup dax wif zup -> Output: yellow green red yellow
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" (both instances)
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
  - ""wif"" translates to ""red""

- Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
  - ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow""
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green""

From the given examples, we can determine that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" every time it appears, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" produces an output that matches the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. 

Let's analyze the examples to confirm this:

1. ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""zup,"" corresponding to yellow.

2. ""zup dax bluf"" yields ""yellow green green."" Here, ""bluf"" again takes the color of the word before it, which is ""dax,"" corresponding to green.

3. ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" yields ""blue blue red blue blue yellow."" Each occurrence of ""bluf"" matches the color of the word immediately preceding it (""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red).

4. ""wif bluf lug"" yields ""red red blue."" ""Bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

5. ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" yields ""red blue blue red yellow."" ""Bluf"" matches the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color value of the word right before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat its color output for the sequence that follows until a different color word is said. 

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Explanation: After ""walm"" is said, ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"" is repeated until ""dax"" (green) appears.

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Explanation: The last color before ""walm"" is ""red"" (corresponding to ""wif""), which repeats.

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Explanation: ""Red"" (from ""wif"") is repeated after ""walm"" until a new color word, ""lug"" for blue, is said.

4. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   Explanation: ""Green"" (from ""dax"") is repeated after ""walm"" until a new color word appears.

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Explanation: ""Blue"" (from ""lug"") is repeated after ""walm"" until ""zup"" (yellow) occurs.

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to repeat its output until a new color word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,79
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Observing the given examples, we can induce the following rules:

1. The output seems to consist of colors, specifically ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red.""
2. ""Lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
3. ""Wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
4. The word ""dax"" seems to be a condition-dependent word as its output varies. When ""dax"" is before ""lug,"" it translates to ""green."" However, when it is before ""wif,"" it still translates to ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" itself may directly translate to ""green,"" irrespective of the word that follows, but there could be additional context we’re not seeing.

For example:
- In ""dax lug,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""green blue.""
- In ""dax wif,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""green red.""

5. ""Walm"" appears to translate to ""blue"" when it precedes ""dax"" or is alone, but when it follows ""dax,"" it seems to maintain the ""green"" coloring of ""dax"" before it.

Given the evidence, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Applying this rule, we get:
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue green red blue red""
- ""lug dax lug wif"" -> ""blue green blue red""
- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green red red green"" (note there was no example including ""bluf,"" so this element remains unaddressed)

The rule for ""walm"" is less clear, but the last example suggests that ""walm"" after ""dax"" could inherit the ""green"" color from ""dax."" However, this pattern is not consistent across all examples. Additional data would be required to refine the rule for ""walm.""
- ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green red red red""

In conclusion, the rule for ""dax"" is that it translates to ""green"" consistently. The behavior of ""walm"" requires further examination but ""dax"" itself appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" consistently appears in the output. To confirm this rule, we can look at the presence of ""wif"" in each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - The first ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"".

2. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - The first and fifth words are ""wif,"" and the colors in the output for those positions are ""red"".

3. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
   - The third word is ""wif"" and the third color is ""red"".

4. Input: wif dax wif
   Output: red green red
   - The first and third words are ""wif"" and the colors for those positions are both ""red"".

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - The third and fifth words are ""wif,"" and the third and fifth colors are ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is:

wif -> red
Analyzing the examples provided, we can attempt to discern a pattern for what ""zup"" could mean in this context:

1. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   - Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   - Still, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", both turning to ""yellow"" in the output.

4. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   - ""zup"" both precedes and follows ""wif"" and ""bluf"", which correspond to ""red"" in the output.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""wif"", each instance corresponds to ""yellow"".

From these examples, we can discern a simple rule:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

So, the rule for ""zup"": zup -> meaning is yellow.
To deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output examples. We will look for correlations between each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs and the corresponding segments in the outputs.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green

In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue

In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""green.""

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

In this example, there are two instances of ""bluf."" They correspond to the first and second ""blue.""

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

In this last example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

Looking at these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output that directly follows the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the input. In other words, ""bluf"" repeats the color value of the word that comes right before it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.
From the given examples, we can induce the following color associations for words that appear before 'walm':

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

'walm' appears to repeat the color of the word that comes directly before it multiple times. Specifically, it seems that 'walm' causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times, based on the patterns we can observe. There's no instance of 'walm' not being preceded by another word, so this rule seems consistent.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,80
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug - Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Input: zup dax wif - Output: yellow green red
Input: lug walm dax - Output: blue blue blue green
Input: dax - Output: green
Input: dax wif - Output: green red

In each instance, the presence of ""dax"" in the input directly correlates with ""green"" in the output. There do not appear to be any other dependent context-related rules for ""dax,"" as it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should look for patterns associated with the word across different inputs and outputs.

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

2. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   ""dax"" still corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

3. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   We see the ""zup"" corresponding to yellow, ""bluf"" to yellow (which contradicts the earlier pairing of ""bluf"" with green, but let's continue), ""wif"" corresponding to red, ""dax"" to green, ""wif"" again corresponding to red, and ""zup"" remaining consistent with yellow.

4. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   Again, ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" is green in this case (aligned with the first case), ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is yellow this time (a discrepancy), and ""lug"" is introduced as blue.

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" also corresponds to red in this case, which differs from previous instances.

Looking at the consistency across examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" is consistently resulting in red. The only time ""wif"" does not directly precede a red in the output is when it's followed by another ""wif"" or when it's at the end of the input, but in both cases, ""wif"" is associated with red for at least one of its occurrences.

It seems that other words may have context-dependent colors, except ""lug,"" which does not have enough occurrences to determine a pattern, but ""wif"" consistently translates to red, regardless of position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color yellow, as evidenced by each instance of ""zup"" in the inputs being translated to ""yellow"" in the outputs.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we analyze the position and corresponding colors in each example. The word's position shifts in each input, allowing us to isolate the possible meaning based on the output:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
3. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red
4. dax bluf wif -> green green red
5. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

Observing the outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence:

1. bluf -> red
2. bluf -> green
3. bluf -> blue
4. bluf -> green
5. bluf -> green

Given that in instances 2, 4, and 5, ""bluf"" corresponds to green, while in instances 1 and 3 it's related to red and blue respectively but is also preceded by a different color, we can theorize that ""bluf"" means ""green,"" and the color before it does not have an impact on the meaning of ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> green
To figure out the meaning of the nonce word 'walm,' we must look for patterns that can be consistently applied to all of the given examples. Let's first list the outputs corresponding to the known words:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Now, let's assess the contexts in which 'walm' appears and its resultant outputs:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Since 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and the output is 'red red red', 'walm' in this context appears to result in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, 'wif'.

2. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Again, 'walm' seems to result in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word 'lug', which is 'blue'.

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Here 'dax' is followed by 'walm' which resulted in two additional greens, and 'wif' is followed by 'bluf' (a word not defined in the outputs) but represented as red. So it would seem 'walm' is again a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Following the pattern, 'walm' again results in a repetition of 'yellow', the color associated with 'zup', and then 'wif' is straightforwardly represented by red.

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   In this final example, 'walm' follows 'zup' and three 'yellow' colors are repeated. After 'lug', we have 'blue', and then 'zup' leads to another 'yellow', followed by the standard translations for 'wif' (red) and 'dax' (green).

By analyzing the pattern in all provided examples, 'walm' seems to result in the repetition of the color corresponding to the previously mentioned word. The number of repetitions appears to match the number of syllables in the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the word before it, with the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of syllables in that previous word.

For example:
- wif (one syllable) before walm resulted in one repetition of red.
- dax (one syllable) before walm resulted in two repetitions of green.
- lug (one syllable) before walm resulted in two repetitions of blue.
- zup (one syllable) before walm resulted in two repetitions of yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,81
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue"" in every provided example.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Here's how the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced from each example:

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green
- ""dax"" is at the end, and ""green"" is at the end of the output.

Input: lug dax bluf
Output: blue green green
- ""dax"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the corresponding output for ""dax"" is ""green.""

Input: dax zup dax zup
Output: green yellow green yellow
- ""dax"" occurs in the first and third positions, and its corresponding outputs are ""green"" both times.

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green
- ""dax"" is at the end again, following after ""lug"" (which is ""blue""), with ""green"" being the output.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- ""dax"" is in the second position after ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), and ""green"" is in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other nonce words, ""wif"" yields the same output every time it appears. 

Thus, the rule I can deduce from the given examples is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following:

In example 1, ""wif zup lug"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue."" Since ""lug"" is not repeated in the other examples, it can be deduced that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In example 2, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" We know that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" Thus, ""walm"" must repeat the color before it, which is ""yellow"" in this context, creating the repetition of ""yellow yellow.""

In example 3, ""zup wif zup"" corresponds to ""yellow red yellow."" Since we already deduced that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" we see that ""zup"" both precedes and follows it, corresponding to ""yellow.""

In example 4, ""wif zup dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow green,"" aligning with previous deductions that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and now ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

In example 5, ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red."" Since ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" precedes it, ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""walm"" seems to replicate the color that precedes it, resulting in the multiple ""red"" outputs.

Therefore, we may deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs and look for patterns.

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup  
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Input: wif bluf dax walm  
Output: red red green green green

Input: lug bluf wif  
Output: blue blue red

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug  
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Input: lug walm wif bluf  
Output: blue blue blue red red

Let's look at the placement of ""bluf"" within the inputs and their respective translated output colors.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" This is consistent with ""zup,"" which also translates to yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it results in ""red,"" the same as for ""wif.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue,"" which matches the output for ""lug.""

Noting these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each example and its associated output:

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
5. dax walm lug -> green green green blue

From examples 1 and 4, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and in 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" 

In examples 2, 4, and 5, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In example 3, when ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is two reds. So, ""wif"" by itself might result in a single ""red,"" but when paired with ""walm,"" it doubles the ""red."" We can't confirm this just yet, but let's keep observing.

Also, looking at examples 2 and 5, ""lug walm"" and ""dax walm lug"" both end with ""blue,"" but ""lug"" is always blue. This suggests ""lug"" controls the color ""blue,"" while ""walm"" does not influence it, since it remains constant.

Now let's analyze ""dax."" In example 3, ""dax wif"" results in ""green red,"" and in example 5, ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue."" It seems that ""dax"" might be associated with the color ""green,"" as in both instances, ""green"" is present in the output.

Based on these observations, we can try to infer the rule for ""walm"":

- It is clear that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color associated with it. 
- When following ""zup"" (example 1 and 4), ""walm"" generates more of the same color as suggested by ""zup,"" which is yellow, so we see ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When following ""lug"" (examples 2 and 5), ""walm"" also generates more of the color suggested by ""lug,"" which is blue, so we see ""blue blue blue.""
- Following ""dax"" (example 5), we get ""green green green,"" which is consistent with ""green"" being the color associated with ""dax.""

Therefore, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the previous word multiple times in the output. The exact number of repetitions may vary based on the preceding word, or potentially based on a rule not entirely decipherable from the given examples. However, we consistently see a multiplication effect wherever ""walm"" appears.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word multiple times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,82
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in a sequence, ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red

The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red"" in each provided example.
Considering the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" from its consistent output.

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output associated with it is always ""yellow"".
- There is no instance where ""zup"" corresponds to any output other than ""yellow"".
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, and its position (before or after ""zup"") does not change its associated output color.

Based on this information, we can conclude the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position relative to other words.
bluf -> ""blue blue"". The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue blue,"" which is the repetition of the word ""blue"" twice, regardless of the context it appears in.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for a pattern in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs.

From the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of a color word three times. Each different word preceding ""walm"" results in a different color being repeated:

- ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
- ""dax walm lug"" -> green green green blue (note that ""lug"" appears again, adding an instance of blue at the end)
- ""wif walm"" -> red red red
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif walm"" (repeated input) -> red red red

The repeated sequence of colors suggests that ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the preceding word three times. The colors appear to be predetermined based on the word that comes before ""walm."" Therefore:

Rule: ""walm"" means to take the color associated with the previous word and repeat that color word three times.

If we were to express this in a more general way, it might look like this:

""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in English.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""dax"" can be inferred as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".
Based on the examples:

Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow

It appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Additionally, the presence of ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"", and its position relative to ""wif"" determines the order in which the colors appear in the output.

Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

wif -> red

When ""wif"" is present in the input, the output always includes ""red"". The color corresponding to ""wif"" remains the same regardless of the ordering or presence of other words in the input.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every time ""zup"" is mentioned, the output includes the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to take the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence. More specifically, ""bluf"" is repeated twice if it is the last word in the sequence or is followed by another ""bluf,"" and it appears once otherwise.

Let's examine the evidence:

1. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" follows a ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it's at the end of the sequence, hence the double ""yellow.""

2. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and it's the last word in the sequence, resulting in a double ""red.""

3. ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""bluf"" is not doubled, it appears once.

4. ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green."" For this line, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and it is not the last in the sequence or followed by another ""bluf,"" so it only translates to a single ""green.""

5. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""green green yellow yellow green."" In this example, the first ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green"" and is followed by ""zup"" rather than another ""bluf,"" so it appears once. The second ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"" and is followed by ""dax,"" so it also appears once.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is followed by another ""bluf"" or it is the last word in the sequence, it is repeated twice.
Analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, one can deduce the following pattern:

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
4. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""

From these examples, we can notice that the occurrence of the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example:

- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output repeats ""yellow"" for ""walm"".
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", and the output repeats ""green"" for each instance of ""walm"".
- In the third and fourth inputs, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", and the output repeats ""blue"" for ""walm"".
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output repeats ""yellow"" for ""walm"".

Based on this, we can conclude that:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,84
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
From the examples provided, one can infer the following associations:

- `dax` consistently corresponds to `green` in the output, regardless of its position in the input string.
- `walm`, when by itself, doesn't have a provided output. However, when it follows `dax`, the output is `green green green`, which likely indicates that `walm` reinforces or repeats the word before it (in this case, `dax` meaning `green`) three times.
- `lug`, `zup`, `bluf`, and `wif` correspond to `blue`, `yellow`, `yellow`, and `red` respectively.

Considering these associations, the rule for the word `dax` seems quite straightforward:

dax -> green. Rule: The word `dax` translates to the color `green`.
To determine the meaning of ""wif"", we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs where ""wif"" appears.

1. ""zup wif"" → ""yellow red""
2. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" → ""blue green green red green""
3. ""zup wif walm"" → ""yellow red red red""
4. ""wif dax bluf"" → ""red green green""
5. ""wif"" → ""red""

In each of these examples, the presence of ""wif"" correlates with the word ""red"" appearing in the output. The position of ""wif"" in the input does not seem to affect its corresponding output:

- When ""wif"" appears at the start, as in example 4 and 5, ""red"" appears at the start of the output.
- When ""wif"" appears in the middle, as in examples 1 and 2, ""red"" appears right after the translation of the word before ""wif"".
- When ""wif"" appears at the end as in example 1, ""red"" is the last color in the output sequence.

Based on this pattern, it seems that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" likely refers to the color ""red"" when it directly follows the word ""wif"" and ""yellow"" when it immediately follows the word ""zup."" Here's an analysis of each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" 
   Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
   - ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" precedes a second ""bluf"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""zup dax bluf""
   Output: ""yellow green green""
   - ""dax"" does not precede ""bluf,"" so it's unclear what ""bluf"" translates to in this case.

3. Input: ""zup bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow.""

4. Input: ""zup wif bluf zup lug""
   Output: ""yellow red red yellow blue""
   - ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" but does not directly precede ""bluf"" this time, so the rule doesn't apply here.

5. Input: ""wif bluf""
   Output: ""red red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be based on the word that directly precedes ""bluf."" If it's ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" means red, and if it's ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" means yellow. The output for when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" is not consistent with the other examples, so further examples would be needed to determine the meaning in that case.

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" if preceded by ""wif,"" ""yellow"" if preceded by ""zup"".
Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced in relation to the other words around it and their corresponding color outputs.

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the resulting color is the same as the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Let's look at the examples:

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red 
   ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs green, and so ""walm"" also outputs green.

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs red, and so ""walm"" also outputs red.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs blue, and so ""walm"" also outputs blue.

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs red, and so ""walm"" also outputs red.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs blue, and so ""walm"" also outputs blue.

Rule:
walm -> The color corresponding to ""walm"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green,green red yellow green,True,85
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue."" Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""lug"" correlating with ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" and the output sequence starts with ""blue,"" followed by other colors that correspond to the remaining words. ""lug"" shows up again towards the end and corresponds to ""blue"" once more.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green,"" with ""lug"" in the middle corresponding to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is interspersed with ""walm"" and ""zup,"" and each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, a single ""green"" is included in the output. No matter how many other words are in the input or what they are, the presence of ""dax"" guarantees the presence of ""green"" in the output. The quantity and color associated with other words, like ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" seem to be consistent as well; however, without more examples it is difficult to deduce their exact meanings. But for ""dax,"" the rule seems clear. So the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can figure out what ""wif"" means by looking at the output associated with it in different contexts. Let's take a look at each instance where ""wif"" appears:

- In ""dax bluf wif lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In ""wif"" alone, the output is ""red"".
- In ""lug wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In ""dax zup wif bluf lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In ""dax zup dax zup wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

In every instance, regardless of the words that precede or follow ""wif"", the output color associated with ""wif"" is ""red"". Based on this, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that 'zup' corresponds to a particular color each time it's used. It's important to compare the occurrences of 'zup' with the rest of the words and their related colors to determine the rule for what 'zup' means.

Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red

The word 'zup' appears once and corresponds to 'yellow'. 'Bluf' also corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' translates to 'red', and 'walm' also seems to translate to 'red'.

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Here, 'zup' translates to 'yellow' each time, 'dax' translates to 'green', 'bluf' is still 'yellow', 'wif' is 'red', and 'lug' is 'blue'.

3. Input: zup dax zup wif -> Output: yellow green yellow red

In this example, each 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'dax' to 'green', and 'wif' to 'red'.

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow

In this sequence, 'dax' is again 'green', 'bluf' is 'green' which differs from the first example, 'wif' is 'red', and 'zup' at the end is 'yellow'.

5. Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue

'Zup' is 'yellow', 'dax' is 'green', and 'lug' is 'blue'.

Combining all observations, every instance of the word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow', regardless of its position or the words that surround it. The color associations for other words may vary, as seen with 'bluf', which is tied to 'yellow' in some instances and 'green' in others.

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'
Given the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for what ""bluf"" represents by examining the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here are the examples mapped side-by-side for analysis:

1. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

4. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

In examples 3 and 5, the input ""wif bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red red"". This suggests that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" map to ""red"". To confirm this, we need to ensure there are no counterexamples. In examples 1, 2, and 4, every time ""bluf"" appears, the output color is ""red"". There is consistency here, as ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color ""red"".

Therefore, we can deduce that:

bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
walm -> repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: When walm follows another word, the output color of that word is repeated three times. For instance, if ""wif"" is associated with the color red, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"". If ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" is associated with green, the output is ""green green green"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,86
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output. Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue.
To deduce what ""dax"" means or the rule it follows, we need to analyze the patterns in the given examples. Let's break down each example:

1. In the sequence ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" This association appears consistent across all examples. 

2. ""wif"" always follows with ""red,"" while ""lug"" is always followed by ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

3. When ""dax"" is present, no matter the position, the first color output is ""green.""

4. The number of ""green"" outputs after ""dax"" seems to correspond with the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively after ""dax.""

Let's now apply this to create a rule for ""dax"":

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in the input sequence, the first output color is always ""green."" If ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output will be a series of ""green"" corresponding to the number of ""walm"" that follow ""dax"" directly.

Therefore, dax -> green. When dax is followed by ""walm,"" the rule is that each ""walm"" after ""dax"" also translates to ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at each example and find a pattern:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - Here ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" and ""lug"" to red, ""zup"" to blue, and there is an additional ""yellow"" at the end.

2. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue and there is an additional red.

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - There is a starting ""red,"" and then the colors correspond to ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" and ""walm"" (blue).

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and again there is an additional ""red"" at the end.

5. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   - There's an initial ""red"" and then ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

From the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to an additional fixed color when it's in the input. When ""wif"" comes after a word, it results in ""red."" When it comes before another word, the sequence starts with ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
By observing the pattern in which the word ""zup"" is associated with a certain color in the output, we can determine its meaning. In each example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word directly before it. 

For example, in all instances when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" which suggests ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"" (green) and duplicates it. Similarly, when ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" again duplicates the color of the word before it (yellow). The pattern holds for a longer string; ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" outputs ""blue green green yellow blue red,"" where the ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to stand.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times in a row. Here's the rule observed:

- In the first example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and the sequence ""yellow yellow yellow"" is given after ""walm.""
- The third example indicates ""lug"" corresponds with blue, resulting in ""blue blue blue"" after ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, the pattern holds for ""lug"" before ""walm,"" with ""blue blue blue,"" and the additional ""lug"" after ""wif"" produces just one ""blue"" as ""lug"" is not immediately followed by ""walm.""
- The fifth example confirms the rule, with ""dax"" leading to ""green,"" followed by ""lug,"" leading to three ""blue,"" and then ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"" after ""walm,"" with ""wif"" providing the color ""red"" separate from the repetition pattern of ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Regardless of context or position within the input sequence, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for what ""zup"" means in each sequence.

1. ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
2. ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green,"" and again ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" once more.
4. ""zup lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue green blue,"" with ""zup"" meaning ""yellow.""
5. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow,"" where ""zup"" stands for ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word preceding it. Here is how the rule applies in each example:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" took the color value of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" and ""dax bluf"" appeared within the same input, and in both instances, ""bluf"" took on the color value of the word directly preceding it (blue for ""lug"" and green for ""dax"").
- In the third and fourth examples, ""lug bluf"" and ""zup bluf"" respectively resulted in ""blue blue"" and ""yellow yellow,"" again showing that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word just before it.
- Finally, in the last example, ""dax bluf"" gave ""green green,"" once more illustrating the pattern.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be a rule that repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times. If we look at each example:

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and translates to blue, and this is repeated three times after it.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and translates to yellow, and this is repeated three times after it.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and translates to blue, and this is repeated three times after it.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and translates to yellow, and this is repeated three times after it.

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and translates to green, and this is repeated three times after it.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color, regardless of its position in the sequence. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" is produced in the output. Therefore, we can induce that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence. The other words in the sequences correlate with other colors.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word 'wif' corresponds to the color red, consistently across all examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a color in the output. The word ""bluf"" appears in every input and each time it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here is the observed pattern:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is that the nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""yellow"". Here is the rule written out:

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, we need to analyze the patterns and the corresponding outputs carefully.

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""bluf"" is not repeated in any other example, making it difficult to determine its meaning directly.

2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again. The appearance of ""walm"" before ""wif"" results in an extra ""green.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - In this case, ""wif"" once again corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" turns the subsequent color to ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Following ""wif,"" the repetition of ""red"" suggests an effect connected with ""walm.""

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Again, ""walm"" seems to affect the word immediately after it, with the color ""green"" preceding it.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" has a duplicating effect on the color that is directly associated with the immediately preceding word. This is evident in the repetition of the color ""green"" when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the additional ""red"" after ""wif walm.""

Based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm duplicates the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Therefore:

walm -> duplicates the preceding color

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,89
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"". There are no instances where ""lug"" maps to any other color or any contextual variations that affect its meaning, so it is consistent that ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red. Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to one instance of the word ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can determine that:

- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax walm"" consistently translates to ""green green green"".

Given that ""zup"" appears to correspond with ""yellow"" in each instance it is used, regardless of its position or the surrounding words, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" The position of ""bluf"" in the phrase does not affect its meaning, as it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its placement in the input.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look at the patterns before and after this word in the input and the corresponding color pattern in the output. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green.""
2. ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green.""
3. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue.""
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green.""
5. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red.""

Comparing inputs and outputs, we can notice the following patterns:

- The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green."" When ""dax"" is present just before ""walm,"" the output sequence starts with ""green.""
- When other words such as ""zup"" or ""lug"" appear before ""walm"" without ""dax"" being immediately before ""walm,"" their colors (""yellow"" for ""zup,"" ""blue"" for ""lug"") repeat.
- The word ""walm"" itself appears to cause a repetition effect, extending the previous color mentioned.

Now, we can deduce that ""walm"" serves as a rule for repetition. More specifically:

- If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""green"" is repeated thrice.
- If any other colored word precedes ""walm"" directly (without ""dax"" being in between), that color is repeated thrice.
- No information is given about ""wif"" directly preceding ""walm,"" as it always appears with ""zup.""

Rule: ""walm"" indicates that the color just before it should be repeated three additional times. If ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" then ""green"" is repeated three times regardless of what comes before ""dax.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,90
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is used in the output at the same position where ""lug"" appeared in the input.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

- Whenever 'dax' appears on its own, the output is 'green'.
- When 'dax' is combined with 'wif', the output is 'green red'.
- 'dax' followed by 'walm' gives an output of 'green green green'.

However, we don't have much context about what 'zup' and 'lug' mean here, as 'dax' does not immediately follow or precede these words in the second example, but the pattern in the second example indicates that 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'. 

With this in mind, we can generalize that 'dax', as a standalone or when it precedes another word, translates to 'green'. Combining it with different words doesn't change its output; rather, it seems to stay constant as 'green' while the other words have their own respective colors.

Rule:
- dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates into the color ""red"" in each instance regardless of its position or the context in which it appears. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" has a consistent meaning or translation across each example given. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Here are the translations for each of the other words, based on the input and output examples:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in the input ""wif zup dax bluf"" which corresponds to ""red yellow green green""

With the above translations considered for consistency, the meaning of ""zup"" can be determined as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: In every instance, ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the input and output pairs.

1. Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is a repeated color of the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"".

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue

- ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" which results in another ""yellow.""

2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is two ""green.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" followed by ""bluf"" which again results in another ""green.""

3. ""Bluf"" after ""zup"" translates to another ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf 
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

- ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and results in a repeated ""yellow.""

4. ""Bluf"" following ""wif"" translates to a repeated ""red.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" leads to another ""red.""

5. The pattern holds in the fifth case as well.

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue

- ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" resulting in a second ""red.""

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that appears immediately before it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and the corresponding output patterns:

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow 
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by three instances of ""yellow"".

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" does not have a direct output equivalent but seems to modify the output after ""lug wif"" to produce two reds instead of one.
   - After ""walm,"" there are three ""red"" before ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"".

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but the presence of ""bluf"" seems to cause it to be repeated.

4. Input: dax walm wif zup -> Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".
   
5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

By examining the patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that comes right before it three times in the output. In each instance, the color word just before ""walm"" is repeated three times immediately after ""walm"" in the output.

Rule: walm -> the word that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,91
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every time ""lug"" is used in the input, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
From the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that come before or after it. Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a particular color. Specifically, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position within the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be that it always translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the patterns from the given inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here are the inputs with their outputs:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
3. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
4. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
5. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue

Now, let's look for patterns:

- In examples 1 and 2, swapping ""dax"" and ""bluf"" changes the color from green to yellow and vice versa, suggesting that ""bluf"" could represent the color ""yellow"" in one instance and ""green"" in the other. The position of ""bluf"" relative to ""dax"" appears to influence the color it represents.

- In example 3, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" with the output of ""bluf"" being ""yellow.""

- In example 4, ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax,"" and its output is ""yellow.""

- In example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and its output is ""blue.""

Based on these observations, we can see a connection between the position of ""bluf"" and the colors ""yellow"" and ""green."" ""Bluf"" seems to represent ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or when it comes before ""lug"" or ""dax."" However, when ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" its color is ""blue.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be conditional on the words surrounding it:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it is ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" comes before ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it is ""yellow.""
- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Based on the above rules, the meaning in each context is as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or precedes ""lug"" or ""dax."" ""Bluf"" represents ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"".

Here is an analysis of each instance:

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
(Here, ""walm"" seems to represent multiple instances of the color associated with ""lug"", which is blue)

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
(Again, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color associated with the preceding word that's a color, ""dax"" which is green)

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
(Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and replicates the blue thrice)

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
(This is identical to the first example, providing further evidence that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"")

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
(""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" which is green)

Based on the above examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat thrice the color of the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word is associated with a color, ""walm"" translates to that color being repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule could be defined as:

Rule: walm -> Replicate the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True,92
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or repetition in the input.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems consistently associated with the output ""green."" However, without context concerning the other words in sequences like ""lug dax"" or ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" it is not possible to precisely define their individual meanings or contributions to the resulting outputs. Nonetheless, given the information at hand, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green

It should be noted that this is a hypothesis based purely on the supplied examples, and additional context or examples might alter or further refine the underlying rule.
Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern where each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds with the color ""red"" in the Output sequence.

Here is how the correlation works:
- zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
- dax wif bluf -> green red red
- wif lug -> red blue
- zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
- lug dax wif -> blue green red

In each example, irrespective of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or the other words around it, ""wif"" always translates to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words it appears with. 

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's break down each example and look for patterns:

1. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
2. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
4. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

The first observation is that ""bluf"" always results in a repetition of the color word that precedes it. 

- In examples 1 and 5, the word ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is red repeated twice.
- In example 2, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is green repeated twice.
- In examples 3 and 4, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is blue repeated twice.

The only deviation from this pattern is in example 3, where a sequence of words leads to a sequence of repeated colors before ""bluf."" The sequence ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, each color word is repeated once for every time it appears before bluf, except for the last occurrence of ""lug,"" which comes just before ""bluf"" and causes the color blue to be repeated twice.

Based on these examples, ""bluf"" seems to double the color of the word that immediately precedes it. However, for a sequence of color words preceding ""bluf,"" each color word leads to the repetition of that color, following its number of occurrences before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated once. If a sequence of color words precedes ""bluf,"" they are repeated according to their occurrence before ""bluf,"" except for the last color word which is doubled.
walm -> 'walm' translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: When 'walm' follows a word, the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated three times. For instance, 'zup walm' becomes 'yellow yellow yellow' because 'zup' translates to yellow, and 'dax walm' becomes 'green green green' because 'dax' translates to green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,93
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue."" Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue.""
- ""dax lug zup dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow green,"" with ""lug"" as ""blue.""
- ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue,"" with ""lug"" as ""blue.""
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" and the only noun is ""lug,"" which must mean ""blue.""
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" and ""lug"" is the only word not previously translated, meaning it corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif zup Output: red yellow
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Input: wif dax wif Output: red green red
Input: wif zup lug wif Output: red yellow blue red
Input: dax wif lug dax Output: green red blue green

From the outputs, it's clear that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""

When ""zup"" appears in the examples, it corresponds to ""yellow"" without any apparent dependence on its position or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule I induce is as follows:

zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" ""Wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes the next color to repeat the previous color, so ""red"" is repeated. ""Dax"" then changes the color to ""green.""
- The second example, ""wif bluf,"" follows the same pattern, producing ""red red.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue,"" with ""lug"" being associated with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" again causes the repetition of ""blue.""
- For ""wif bluf lug zup,"" we again see the pattern with ""wif"" yielding ""red,"" ""bluf"" repeating that ""red,"" ""lug"" changing it to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" changing it to ""yellow.""
- The last example, ""zup bluf wif,"" shows ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeating that ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" changing the sequence to ""red.""

So, bluf -> Repeats the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should observe its associations with the colors in the outputs and look for patterns.

- In the first example, ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green"", and ""zup walm"" (without ""dax"") translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests that ""walm"" may contribute to the repetition of ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" changes the last color to green.
  
- In the second example, we see again that ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" follows, we get repeated ""yellow"" output as deduced before.

- The third example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" has an output of ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" yields ""red"", ""dax"" yields ""green,"" ""zup"" repeats the ""yellow,"" and then we have two additional ""yellow"" coming from ""walm.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm,"" it translates to ""green blue blue blue."" This tells us that ""lug"" contributes to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" here again seems to cause a repetition effect, resulting in two extra ""blue"" in the output.

- The fifth example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" with an output of ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" again shows ""lug"" leading to ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous output color (in this case ""blue""), ""dax"" yields ""green,"" and then ""wif"" yields ""red.""

From these observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the previous word's color to be repeated in the output.
- The repetition continues until another word with a defined color (such as ""dax"" or ""wif"") follows.

Rule:
walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated in the output until a word with a different associated color appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,94
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern that suggests the meaning of the word ""dax"" in this context. Let's analyze the given inputs and outputs:

Input: wif lug dax lug  
Output: red blue green blue  
In this sequence, ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Input: dax zup  
Output: green yellow  
Here, ""dax"" comes before ""zup,"" and the corresponding output starts with ""green"" followed by ""yellow.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm  
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow  
Again, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and is translated as ""green.""

Input: zup dax  
Output: yellow green  
In this example, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and its output is ""green"" which follows ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm dax lug  
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue  
Finally, ""dax"" is proceeded by ""zup walm"" which correspond to ""yellow yellow yellow"" and followed by ""lug,"" which is ""blue."" The ""dax"" in this sequence is ""green.""

From these examples, it is clear that independently of its position in the sequence or the words around it, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green."" There does not seem to be variation in the meaning of ""dax"" based on these examples.

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the provided input-output pairs and identify a consistent pattern.

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red
- Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" and every other word ""walm"" translates to ""red"" twice.

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow
- ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to the first ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to the second ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to both instances of ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" always produces the output ""red."" There does not seem to be contextual dependency on adjacent words for the meaning of ""wif."" Therefore, the rule can be simply:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: In each example, the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow'.
Based on the examples provided, there seems to be a pattern where the output color sequences repeat certain colors for specific input words. Specifically, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output color sequence seems to repeat the color that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" and in the output, ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""wif,"" is repeated once after the first ""red"" (which also corresponds to ""wif"").
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""zup"") is repeated.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" repeats.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and once again, ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.

Based on the pattern noted, the rule seems to be that the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before ""bluf"" is repeated once in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe how ""walm"" affects the output of the sequence. Let's analyze the patterns:

Example 1:
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
- Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Example 2:
- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
- Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Example 3:
- Input: lug walm zup wif
- Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Example 4:
- Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
- Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Example 5:
- Input: dax lug walm zup wif
- Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Based on these examples, we can notice that whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the word following ""walm"" results in a color sequence that follows the pattern of ""blue yellow red,"" or it introduces a ""blue"" color before the color that would normally be associated with the following word. This can be seen in Example 3, where ""walm zup wif"" results in ""blue yellow red,"" and in other examples, ""walm"" causes a ""blue"" to be added before the continuation of the pattern.

Considering this, we can induce the rule that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a rule that adds a ""blue"" output or otherwise affects the sequence to produce ""blue"" as the next color in the pattern.

Rule:
walm -> Introduces a ""blue"" in the sequence or results in the pattern ""blue yellow red"" depending on the following word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
To induce the rules for the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look at the color output in relation to its placement and co-occurring words:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. wif dax -> red green
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup dax lug dax -> yellow green blue green
5. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue

Analyzing each line:

1. dax preceding walm turns everything green.
2. dax following wif turns dax itself green, and wif is red.
3. dax preceding lug turns dax green and lug blue, while walm remains green.
4. dax following zup turns dax green, and preceding lug turns lug blue and the second dax is also green.
5. dax preceding bluf turns dax and bluf green, following wif turns wif red, following zup turns zup yellow, and preceding lug turns lug blue.

Based on the examples, ""dax"" appears to be an indicator for the color green when it stands alone or before a word not specifically associated with another color (as in ""dax"" before ""walm"" or ""bluf""). However, ""dax"" preceding ""lug"" consistently turns ""lug"" blue. Also, ""dax"" does not seem to affect the colors denoted by ""wif"" or ""zup,"" which produce red and yellow, respectively, regardless of the presence of ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> turns the word it immediately precedes to green, unless that word inherently represents another color (""lug"" to blue), and turns itself green if it is not followed by another word that has a predetermined color associated with it.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. There is no variation in this pattern, no matter where ""wif"" is positioned within the series of words or what other words surround it.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can induce that the word ""zup"" rules in a specific color output, which is ""yellow."" Let's verify this by examining each example:

- In the first example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" and ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" in other examples. Thus, ""zup"" must translate to ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" translates to ""red green red red yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is ""red."" After ""bluf"" (which is ""red""), ""zup"" appears and is followed by ""yellow"" in the output, further supporting the previous deduction.

- In the third example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" appears at the beginning and is directly translated to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" aligning with previous observations.

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue green blue."" ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" making ""zup"" the only untranslated word, which turns out to be ""yellow.""

- In the fifth and final example, ""lug wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue red yellow red."" ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the appearance of ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" in the output once again.

Considering the evidence across all examples, it is clear that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> 'bluf' appears to take the color associated with the first word in each pair (lug -> blue, dax -> green, wif -> red) and repeats it twice.

Rule: When 'bluf' follows a color-associated word, the output is that color repeated twice.
walm -> meaning. Meaning is that the word preceding ""walm"" determines its color, and ""walm"" results in repeating that color three times.

Rule: If X is the color word before ""walm"", then ""walm"" translates to X X X.
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" is blue blue blue.
- In ""lug wif walm"", ""wif"" is red, so ""walm"" is red red red.
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" is green, so ""walm"" is green green green.
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" is blue blue blue.
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" is yellow yellow yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red blue red yellow red red,red blue red yellow yellow,False,96
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning can be the word ""blue"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output always includes the color ""green."" This indicates that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position within the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no variation in the output associated with the presence of ""wif,"" regardless of the context it appears in. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""wif"" is directly related to the color red in these examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""zup"" appears in different positions in the input sequence and does not change its corresponding output color.
- Other words correlate with other colors (e.g., ""dax"" with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue""), but ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, we can conclude the meaning of ""zup"" as follows:

zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" in the input always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or surrounding words.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
   ""wif"" results in ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" which suggests ""bluf"" might be a repetition of the previous color.

2. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
   
   ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""zup"" yields ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows each, it repeats the previous color, ""green green"" and ""yellow yellow.""

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   
   ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf"" gives ""blue blue,"" indicating repetition of the previous color.

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
   By analyzing the sequence of the input and their respective colors, again, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the previous color.

5. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   
   Each time, ""bluf"" follows a color word, the color is repeated.

Based on these examples, the rule seems quite clear:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color mentioned before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can try to establish the rules governing the assignment of colors:

- ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to ""green.""
- ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to ""yellow"" (example 2) and ""blue"" (example 5) when it is followed by ""lug.""
- ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to ""red.""

Now, let's look at ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (examples 1, 2, and 3), it seems to cause ""wif"" to repeat its color ""red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (examples 1, 3), the color ""green"" is sustained.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""zup,"" resulting in green green green yellow, so ""walm"" does not influence the change to yellow.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is the last word with two ""zup"" words before it, resulting in only ""yellow"" outputs, which suggests ""walm"" might have repeated ""yellow.""

From these observations, a potential rule for ""walm"" could be that it causes the previous color to repeat. However, this is not consistent when ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" in example 4, as it does not repeat ""green"" before changing to ""yellow."" 

Another possibility is that ""walm"" might be a sort of ""wildcard"" that takes on the value of the preceding color or causes it to repeat, except when a transition is expected (as in ""zup"" after ""dax,"" which seems to always yield ""yellow""). But since ""zup"" in example 5 also yields yellow, it suggests that ""walm"" could simply prolong the previous color output as well.

Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""walm"" could be a rule that extends the sequence of the current color pattern, but it does not override transitions that are already established by the sequence (like ""dax"" followed by ""zup"").

Rule:
walm -> Extends the sequence of the current color unless there is a transition that would otherwise occur as established by other words in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,97
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at correlated inputs and outputs to identify a pattern.

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
2. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
3. ""wif zup dax"" -> ""red yellow green""
4. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue"" (repeated example, consistent output)
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

We observe that every output contains the color ""green"" when the word ""dax"" is present in the input. Since ""dax"" is common in each of these inputs and ""green"" is common in each corresponding output, that suggests the word ""dax"" itself translates to ""green.""

However, it's also possible that ""dax"" modifies the following word to add ""green"" to the output. Since we don't see ""dax"" followed by multiple different words producing the same output and since we don't have examples of ""dax"" on its own, it is difficult to tell if it is a standalone word or a modifier without more context. Given the available information, a simple interpretation is best.

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif bluf lug zup Output: red red blue yellow
- Here, 'wif' directly translates to 'red' and is followed by 'red' for 'bluf', 'blue' for 'lug', and 'yellow' for 'zup'.

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax Output: green blue yellow red red green
- 'dax' translates to 'green', with 'lug' as 'blue', 'zup' as 'yellow', and 'wif' and 'bluf' both giving 'red'.

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- 'wif' translates to 'red', 'walm' to red since it's the first appearance, then 'zup' to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and subsequent 'walm' to 'yellow' (since it's not the first occurrence).

Input: wif Output: red
- 'wif' by itself translates to 'red'.

Input: zup lug walm wif walm Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', followed by the first 'walm' translating to 'blue' (since it's the first appearance after a 'blue'), 'wif' remains 'red', and subsequent 'walm' also translates to 'red' because it follows a 'red'.

From these examples, the resulting rule seems consistent:

Rule: wif -> red

The rule is that the nonce word 'wif' always translates to the color 'red', irrespective of its position or context within the given inputs.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the word ""zup"" seems to be consistent across all examples. In each instance, regardless of the surrounding words, ""zup"" is translated to the same output color.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The first example sets ""lug bluf"" to mean ""blue blue,"" which directly suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" Each subsequent example shows ""bluf"" consistently translating to ""blue,"" regardless of the context or the words that come before it. Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" means ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
From the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to be a repeated sequence of a color word, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input sequence (including ""walm""). 

To illustrate:

1. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" – Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" is followed by one other word (itself), we have three ""blue"" in the output.

2. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue red green"" – ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The three ""blue"" in the output correspond to ""lug walm wif"" with ""walm"" causing the repetition.

3. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" – Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows, leading to a triple ""green"" in the output.

4. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" outputs ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"" – ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" there is ""zup"" and another ""lug,"" indicating ""walm"" caused the quadruple count of ""blue,"" with the sequence finishing with the colors for the last ""zup lug.""

5. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"" – As before, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""walm"" comes at the end and is followed by two words (including itself), it creates a triple ""red"" in the output.

Based on the patterns observed, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, with the number of repetitions equal to the total number of words following ""walm"" (including itself).

Walm -> Causes the repetition of the prior color in the output, the number of times equal to the count of words following ""walm"" (including itself).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax
    ",Output: green yellow green,green yellow green,True,98
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the examples given, I'll evaluate the instances where ""lug"" appears and the respective output to deduce its meaning:

1. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
2. Input: lug bluf | Output: blue blue
3. Input: lug zup wif lug | Output: blue yellow red blue
4. Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow
5. Input: lug wif bluf | Output: blue red red

Based on the examples, we observe the following patterns:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is in the corresponding output.
- ""lug"" appears before other color words in the input, such as ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" which correspond to the colors red and blue, respectively.
- The position of ""lug"" does not alter its corresponding output; it consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless if it's at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence.

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" is consistent:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Rule: dax -> green

The rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every output. It is not dependent on the context, as it retains the same meaning regardless of its position in a sentence or the words that surround it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"". 

Evidence: 

- In every example where ""bluf"" is present, the consistent output is the word ""yellow"".
  
  - Example: ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow"", with ""bluf"" corresponding to the second ""yellow"".
  - Example: ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", with ""bluf"" again corresponding to ""yellow"".
  - Example: ""zup lug bluf wif"" outputs ""yellow blue blue red"", with ""bluf"" corresponding to the second ""blue"", but given that ""lug"" already maps to ""blue"", and each input word appears to map to a unique color, it's logical to deduce that here ""bluf"" actually maps to ""yellow"", and the pattern of colors from the provided data suggests a mistake in the output where the second color should be ""yellow"" instead of ""blue"".
  - Example: ""zup wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow red red"", which again indicates that ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"" as the repetition of ""red"" comes after ""bluf"", suggesting it cannot be representing ""bluf"".
  - Example: ""zup bluf"" consistently outputs ""yellow yellow"", reinforcing the mapping of ""bluf"" to ""yellow"".

Therefore: bluf -> yellow.
From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" instructs to repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes it three times. Here's how it plays out in each example:

Input: zup walm lug
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat three times.
- ""lug"" translates to blue.

Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: zup wif walm lug
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""wif"" changes the output to red.
- ""walm"" makes ""red"" repeat three times since it follows ""wif"".
- ""lug"" is blue.

Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: dax walm wif bluf
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""walm"" makes ""green"" repeat three times.
- ""wif"" changes the output to red.
- ""bluf"" is red again (probably a mistake in the input, as ""bluf"" outputting red does not follow the pattern established in other inputs).

Output: green green green red red

Input: dax walm
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""walm"" makes ""green"" repeat three times.

Output: green green green

Input: wif walm
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""walm"" makes ""red"" repeat three times.

Output: red red red

Therefore:

Rule: walm -> causes the color denoted by the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup
    ",Output: blue blue blue yellow,blue blue blue yellow,True,99
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the available examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" To confirm, we can look at the solitary instances where ""lug"" is used and note the output, as well as occurrences where ""lug"" is part of a series and observe if the output changes or remains consistent. In every example given where ""lug"" appears, the resulting output is ""blue.""

Here are the inputs with ""lug"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   
2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   (Note: ""lug"" stands alone in the middle, and the output is ""blue"".)
   
3. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   
4. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   (Note: ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" but ""lug"" itself still corresponds to ""blue"".)
   
5. Input: dax zup lug
   Output: green yellow blue
   (Again, ""lug"" is at the end and corresponds to ""blue"", regardless of what precedes it.)

Given this consistent translation, we can infer the following rule:

lug -> meaning. The meaning is ""blue"". Rule: Regardless of context or other surrounding words, ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we can compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup dax wif zup
   Output: yellow green red yellow

2. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

By observing each instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, we can analyze its corresponding color in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" also corresponds to green after a sequence of ""zup"" and then ""bluf.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" follows two repetitions of the word ""walm"" and corresponds to green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" and ""bluf,"" both times corresponding to green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is green again, later when ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" the output is still green.

Considering all these instances, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of the preceding word. The rule appears to be that ""dax"" is always translated to ""green"" in the output regardless of its position or the context within the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each instance, regardless of position or context within the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears. There does not seem to be any context-dependent variation; it consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the other words present. Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is used to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. Each unique word corresponds to a specific color:

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red

Whenever the word ""bluf"" follows one of these words, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

So, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" in this context is:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word before it three times. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

1. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue"" (The color blue, which is associated with ""lug,"" is repeated three times after ""walm."")
   
2. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" (The color blue, associated with ""lug,"" is repeated three times after ""walm."")

3. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow"" (The color green, which is associated with ""dax,"" is repeated three times after ""walm."")

4. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (The color blue, which is associated with ""lug,"" is repeated three times after ""walm."")

5. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow"" (The color green, which is associated with ""dax,"" is repeated three times after ""walm."")

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug zup bluf wif bluf
    ",Output: red blue yellow yellow red red,red blue yellow yellow red red,True,100
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided, every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", we need to look at the patterns where it appears and the associated output.

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif bluf"", the output is ""green red red"". Since the output color sequence begins with green, it suggests that ""dax"" may be associated with the color green. The ""red red"" sequence might be related to the words ""wif bluf"" and how they follow ""dax"".
- The second instance has ""dax walm wif"", and the corresponding output is ""green green green red"". Once again, we see that the sequence begins with green, reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" may correspond to the color green. Moreover, the ""green green"" might be related to the word ""walm"", as it is the only word that repeats the same color besides ""dax"".
- In the third example, ""dax lug bluf"" gives us ""green blue blue"". As with the previous examples, ""dax"" is followed by green, further supporting the idea that ""dax"" means green.
- When ""dax"" appears by itself, the output is simply ""green"", which is very strong evidence that ""dax"" indeed means green.
- The final example provides a pattern where ""dax"" is at the beginning and at the end, with ""bluf zup bluf"" in the middle. The output sequence is ""green green yellow yellow green"". The green at the beginning and end correspond to ""dax"" and the middle sequence suggests that ""bluf"" is associated with ""yellow"". It is also possible that the second ""green"" corresponds to a rule about sequence or repetition.

Based on these patterns, the clearest rule that can be established is that the word ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" No matter where ""wif"" appears in a sequence, the output always includes ""red"" in the corresponding position. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"" as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at its occurrence in each example and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green
2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
3. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf | Output: green red green yellow yellow
4. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: dax zup walm wif | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Now let’s analyze:

- In the first input, ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second input, ""zup"" occurs twice, and both times correspond to ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the third input, ""zup"" also corresponds to a ""yellow"" in the output.
- The fourth input is just ""zup bluf"" and outputs ""yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""zup"" precedes two instances of ""yellow"" and itself corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these examples, it appears that ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Following the provided examples and analyzing the corresponding outputs, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color 'yellow', but when it follows another color-related nonce, it corresponds to that same color instead.

Detailing the rule:

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" ""zup"" translates to 'yellow', ""lug"" translates to 'blue', and ""dax"" translates to 'green'. Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is 'yellow', which is the color associated with ""zup"". It seems to mirror the color of the word before it.

2. In the second example, ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to 'green', and ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in 'green', the color associated with ""dax"".

3. The third example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf,"" shows that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and hence gets the output 'yellow', which is the color associated with ""zup"".

4. In the fourth example, ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to 'blue', and ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" so ""bluf"" results in 'blue', akin to the word preceding it.

5. The fifth example, ""zup bluf lug,"" has ""bluf"" after ""zup,"" so ""bluf"" mirrors the color of ""zup"" and thus translates to 'yellow'.

From the above analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

**Rule:** ""bluf"" -> mirrors the color associated with the word directly preceding it. If there is no precedent, it defaults to 'yellow'.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that 'walm' generates repeated instances of the color 'blue'. To determine the exact rule, let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

- When ""lug walm"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue blue"". It suggests that both ""lug"" and ""walm"" might produce the color blue, and ""walm"" may also add repetition.
- When ""dax lug walm"" is in the input, ""green blue blue blue"" is in the output. Here, ""dax"" yields green, ""lug"" gives blue once, and ""walm"" follows with additional blues.
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", it results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". We can see that ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""bluf"" give one instance of red, yellow, and blue respectively. ""lug"" again produces blue, and the occurrence of ""walm"" results in multiple blues.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" transforms into ""yellow red red red blue"". This further shows ""lug"" is consistently blue, ""zup"" and ""wif"" are yellow and red, respectively, and ""walm"" converts the following color to red multiple times.
- ""lug walm zup wif"" leading to ""blue blue blue yellow red"" supports that ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" and ""wif"" follow the previously observed yellow and red, and ""walm"" produces repetitive blues.

It's consistent in each example that ""walm"" takes the preceding color and repeats it two additional times. This rule applies regardless of what the color is, as seen in cases where ""lug"" is not the word directly preceding ""walm.""

Thus, the rule appears as follows:

Rule: 'walm' -> Causes the color immediately preceding it to be repeated two additional times. If 'blue' precedes 'walm', the output gives us two additional 'blue'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,101
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule that can be induced for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is as follows:

Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it correlates with the color ""green"" in the output. This pattern is consistent across all examples, regardless of what other words precede or follow ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" is present, the output includes ""red"" in the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. 

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is an instruction to repeat the color associated with the previous word. Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   (wif corresponds to the color red, followed by ""bluf"" which repeats the color red.)

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   (zup corresponds to the color yellow, followed by ""bluf"" which repeats the color yellow.)

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   (Here, each word corresponds to a color. ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red. ""bluf"" after ""wif"" results in the repetition of red, hence ""red red."")

4. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   (Here, ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" after ""dax"" repeats green. Then ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" again is blue, followed by ""wif"" which is red.)

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   (This example is identical to the first one and further supports the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.)

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repetition of the color denoted by the word that precedes it. In the outputs, every instance of ""walm"" causes the color word before it to repeat a number of times equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.

Here's the breakdown of each example to see the pattern:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   (Here ""lug"" means blue, and ""walm"" repeats the blue three times.)

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   (Once again, ""lug"" means blue, and ""walm"" repeats the blue three times.)

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   (Every color is stated once except for blue which is after ""lug walm"" and is repeated three times according to the ""walm"" rule.)

4. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   (Here, ""dax"" is green, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the green thrice, then ""lug"" translates to blue without repetition.)

5. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   (For ""dax walm"" we see the green repeated three times. Then, ""zup walm"" shows yellow repeated three times in a similar pattern to ""walm"" when it follows ""dax"" or ""lug"".)

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example, regardless of its position within the sequence of words.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the outputs for each time ""dax"" appears in the input, it consistently translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the corresponding output. This relationship is consistent across all examples given.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". Here's the breakdown of the examples:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""red yellow,"" suggesting that ""wif"" might mean ""red.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" which could suggest that ""bluf"" also means ""yellow,"" or it has no effect on the output, therefore being redundant.
- When ""zup"" stands alone, the output is simply ""yellow.""

The consistent element across these examples is that the presence of ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" appearing in the output. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" is the first word, it defaults to ""blue."" Here’s the reasoning:

- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" which again shows ""bluf"" taking the color of the word right before it, which is ""wif"" (red).
- ""dax bluf wif"" leads to ""green green red,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow green blue,"" where ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- The last example, ""lug bluf,"" is redundant but confirms ""bluf"" as ""blue"" after ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color of the word preceding it. If it is the first word, it defaults to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word, defaulting to blue if it is the first word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" is a replicate modifier for the color associated with the preceding word. Each instance of ""walm"" repeats the color denoted by the word before it three times.

Here are the observed patterns:
- ""lug wif walm"" -> blue red red red (the word ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" repeats it three times)
- ""zup wif walm"" -> yellow red red red (the word ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" repeats it three times)
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue (the word ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""walm"" repeats it three times, then yellow is for ""zup,"" followed by ""lug"" and its three blue repeats)
- ""zup walm dax lug"" -> yellow yellow yellow green blue (the word ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""walm"" repeats it three times, then green for ""dax"" followed by blue for ""lug"")
- ""wif walm zup"" -> red red red yellow (the word ""wif"" is associated with red, ""walm"" repeats it three times, followed by yellow for ""zup"")

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> When preceding a color, it causes that color to be repeated three more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be consistent regardless of the context in which it is used. In each instance, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color red in the output. If we look at the instances of ""wif"" and the immediate output for each instance, we see that it consistently translates to ""red"":

- ""zup dax zup wif"" -> yellow green yellow red
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red
- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> green red red red blue yellow
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> yellow red green green green blue

In each case above, the word ""wif"" is directly followed by the color red in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce that each given word corresponds to a color in the output. Observing the patterns:

- ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green""
- ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red""
- ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" in the one example where it appears

Each instance of the word ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it. Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

The word ""bluf"" triggers a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before it. In each example given, ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word (such as ""dax"" for green, ""lug"" for blue, ""zup"" for yellow, and ""wif"" for red) to be repeated in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between its input occurrences and the corresponding output, and analyze what changes from example to example:

In the first example, ""wif lug walm,"" the output is ""red blue blue blue."" We can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""blue,"" it indicates repetition of the color that precedes it.

In the second example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the output ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"" suggests ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and this confirms the prior rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word: ""wif"" is ""red"" followed by two additional ""red,"" and after ""zup,"" we have two additional ""yellow.""

The third input, ""dax walm wif walm,"" with the output ""green green green red red red,"" supports this rule: ""walm"" after ""dax"" yields two more ""green,"" and ""walm"" after ""wif"" yields two more ""red.""

In the fourth input, ""dax walm lug,"" the pattern continues with ""green green green blue,"" where ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which produces two more instances of ""green.""

Lastly, in the fifth input, ""lug zup walm lug,"" the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Again, ""zup walm"" results in additional ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the prior rule.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word preceding it another two times. So the meaning of ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif bluf
    ",Output: green red red,green red red,True,104
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" each time it appears in the input.
Based on the provided examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence. Every appearance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" appearing in the corresponding position in the output. The other words, ""zug,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" correspond to other colors (""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue"" respectively).

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the provided examples, irrespective of its position in the input list.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Zup consistently translates to ""yellow"" in each given example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to consistently output a series of two identical colors. Here are the observations from the examples:

- lug bluf: blue blue
  lug -> blue
  bluf -> blue blue

- dax bluf zup: green green yellow
  dax -> green
  bluf -> green green
  zup -> yellow

- wif zup bluf wif dax: red yellow yellow red green
  wif -> red
  zup -> yellow
  bluf -> yellow yellow
  wif -> red
  dax -> green

- zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
  zup -> yellow
  lug -> blue
  walm -> extra yellow
  dax -> green
  wif -> red
  bluf -> red red

- dax lug zup wif bluf dax: green blue yellow red red green
  dax -> green
  lug -> blue
  zup -> yellow
  wif -> red
  bluf -> red red
  dax -> green

Based on these observations, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color word that immediately follows it (or precede in its original input). The color following ""bluf"" in the input is always output twice in the corresponding color in the output. Therefore, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: bluf -> the word following bluf is repeated twice in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the provided examples that correlate with the changing outputs. We'll examine each input that contains ""walm"" and compare the outputs.

Input 1: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output 1: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Input 2: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output 2: green green green red blue green green green

Input 3: lug zup walm lug
Output 3: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input 4: lug dax walm wif
Output 4: blue green green green red

Input 5: wif walm
Output 5: red red red

Looking at the outputs, these are the observations:

- After every instance of ""walm,"" the color in the output sequence is repeated from the previous color at least once.
- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""walm"" is followed by another word, and the respective color for that word is ""green,"" which is also repeated.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows the word ""zup,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated afterward.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

These observations suggest that ""walm"" causes the next color to repeat the color associated with the word just before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

If there is no preceding word (or if it's the first word in the sequence), then it could be assumed that the default color is red, as shown in example 5. To give a comprehensive rule that includes this case:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, repeat the output color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the first word, repeat the color red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,105
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided the meaning of ""lug"" can be inferred as follows:

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

In this sequence, the only unpaired term and color is ""lug"" and ""blue.""

Input: lug
Output: blue

When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is blue, this reinforces that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Two instances of ""lug"" both translate to blue. Other words correspond to their respective colors as previously established.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Here ""lug"" is still associated with blue, and other terms maintain their colors from previous examples.

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue

With ""zup"" corresponding to yellow as seen in the first example, ""lug"" consistently matches with blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, we can infer the meaning of the term ""dax"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: wif bluf dax walm  
Output: red red green green green  
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output, which follows two ""red"" outputs.

Input: dax  
Output: green  
Here, ""dax"" is the only word in the input and corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax lug dax  
Output: green blue green  
In this example, ""dax"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax bluf zup  
Output: green green yellow  
Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax lug bluf dax  
Output: green blue blue green  
""Dax"" appears at the beginning and end of the input sequence and corresponds to ""green"" in both instances in the output.

Rule:
Based on the consistent association between ""dax"" and the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of position or surrounding words, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red"" in the output. It seems that whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is included in the output. Here's the pattern I observe:

- ""dax wif"" yields ""green red"" (the presence of ""dax"" yields ""green"")
- ""wif"" alone yields ""red""
- ""zup wif"" yields ""yellow red"" (the presence of ""zup"" yields ""yellow"")
- ""wif"" alone again yields ""red""
- ""wif dax lug"" yields ""red green blue"" (the presence of ""dax"" yields ""green"" and ""lug"" yields ""blue"")

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as: 

wif -> red. 

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, include ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> ""blue"" when following a color word, the color word itself when following any other word.

Rule: bluf becomes ""blue"" when the preceding word is 'lug' which outputs ""blue,"" and it copies the color word of the preceding term (e.g. 'dax' yields ""green,"" 'zup' yields ""yellow,"" and 'wif' yields ""red""). When following another 'bluf' or non-color word, it seems to retain the color of the last actual color word mentioned.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can compare the inputs with their respective outputs, keeping an eye out for patterns that correspond to the presence of ""walm.""

Reviewing the outputs, we can observe that the color ""red"" is repeated after ""walm"" in each instance where ""walm"" appears:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   
2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   
3. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   
4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

Every instance of ""walm"" is followed by three instances of the color ""red"" in the generated output sequence. The word preceding ""walm"" does not appear to affect this pattern, nor does the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence. Therefore, the nonce word ""walm"" can be associated with the rule of emitting three ""red"" outputs following its occurrence.

Rule: walm -> Emit ""red"" three times sequentially in the output whenever it appears in the input.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,106
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, here is the rule I have deduced:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Therefore:

lug -> blue

This rule is supported by each example where the presence of the nonce word ""lug"" consistently results in the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

Input: dax
Output: green
- Here, each time 'dax' appears alone, the output is 'green'.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
- 'dax' appears within a sequence and the output corresponding to 'dax' is 'green'.

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
- Again, 'dax' is used in a sequence and the corresponding output is 'green'.

Input: dax
Output: green
- 'dax' appears alone and the output is consistent with previous examples, 'green'.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- 'dax' precedes another word and the output for 'dax' remains 'green'.

Rule:
dax -> green

The rule here seems to indicate that the nonce word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the meaning 'green', regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can analyze the positions where ""zup"" appears and the corresponding output colors.

- In the first example, each occurrence of ""zup"" leads to the output ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" appears once, again leading to the output ""yellow.""
- The third example presents ""zup"" by itself, and the output is ""yellow.""
- The fourth example has ""zup"" occurring after ""wif,"" with the output being ""red yellow,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- The fifth example has ""zup"" at the beginning, and the output starts with ""yellow.""

From these examples, it does not seem like ""zup"" has a position-dependent meaning or that it modifies the meaning of adjacent words. It consistently corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, we are attempting to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" To do this, we need to look for patterns in the examples that can help us figure out what ""bluf"" translates to. 

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""wif"" -> red

2. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   - Since ""zup"" -> yellow and ""lug"" -> blue, ""bluf"" in this case resulted in ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""bluf"" followed by ""zup"" results in a repetition of ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - The presence of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" results in a repetition of ""green.""

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""bluf"" after ""dax"" results in a repetition of ""green.""

From these examples, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color (word) that immediately precedes it.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color (word) that immediately precedes ""bluf"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm."" Here's the interpretation of the given data:

1. ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes the next word ""wif"" to also translate to ""blue"" before it switches to ""red.""

2. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" makes the next word ""dax"" also translate to ""red"" before changing to ""green"" and then ""yellow.""

3. ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in the next word ""lug"" repeating the color ""green"" before changing to ""blue.""

4. ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and with ""walm,"" the next word ""wif"" also translates to ""yellow"" before changing to ""red.""

5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" The first ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""walm"" makes ""zup"" also ""blue,"" then the pattern continues normally after ""walm.""

With this pattern, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> The word following ""walm"" repeats the color translation of the word preceding ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" No matter the other words in the input, whenever ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" is part of the output.

Therefore, the rule I have deduced is:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in an input, the output will include the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif.""

Let's examine the evidence:

- When ""zup wif"" is input, the output is ""yellow red.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" gives ""red red green green green.""
- ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue.""
- ""zup wif zup"" becomes ""yellow red yellow.""
- ""dax walm wif zup"" turns to ""green green green red yellow.""

From these examples, we note that the presence of ""wif"" corresponds with the word ""red"" in the output. Additionally, the other words (""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""lug"") correspond to colors (""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" respectively).

Given this, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" by examining the context in which it appears and the corresponding output.

1. Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green
2. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf | Output: yellow green yellow green red red
3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif | Output: blue green yellow green green green red
4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif | Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
5. Input: dax bluf wif zup | Output: green green red yellow

By examining the instances where ""zup"" appears, we can observe the following patterns:

- ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
- This translation does not appear to depend on the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the surrounding words.
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, irrespective of the other words in the sequence, the output always includes ""yellow"" in the position corresponding to ""zup"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow

This rule simply means that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its context within the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's analyze the given data:

- When ""wif bluf"" appears, the output is ""red red"". ""wif"" by itself in another context could align with ""red"", suggesting that ""bluf"" might also translate to ""red"".
- In the sequence ""zup bluf wif lug dax"", the outputs are ""yellow yellow red blue green"". We can attempt to assign colours to each word based on the evidence. We know ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""dax"" has appeared with ""green"". If ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow"", then it suggests ""lug"" could be ""blue"" and leaves ""bluf"" once again translating to ""red"".
- In the last two examples, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green"" and ""zup lug bluf"" to ""yellow blue blue"". Since we've inferred from previous examples that ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"", it would seem that ""bluf"" repeats the colour of the word immediately preceding it.

Based on the evidence provided, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the colour of the word before it. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word
To deduce the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" observe the outcomes associated with it in various contexts from the provided examples:

1. When ""wif lug walm"" occurs, the output is ""red blue blue blue."" The presence of ""walm"" equates to three instances of ""blue.""
2. When ""wif walm"" occurs, the output is ""red red red."" Here, ""walm"" equates to two instances of ""red.""
3. When ""lug wif walm"" occurs, the output is ""blue red red red."" In this case, ""walm"" equates to three instances of ""red.""
4. When ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" translates to two ""blue.""
5. When ""dax walm wif zup"" is presented, the output is ""green green green red yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" corresponds to two instances of ""green.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that precedes it, meaning the color associated with the word right before ""walm,"" two or three times, depending on the context.

Formulating the rule, we can infer that:
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it results in three repetitions of the color associated with ""wif"" (the color ""red"").
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in two repetitions of the color associated with ""lug"" (the color ""blue"").
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in two repetitions of the color associated with ""dax"" (the color ""green"").

However, the current examples are not entirely consistent, as ""lug walm"" leads to two instances of the color blue, but ""lug wif walm"" leads to three instances of the color red. To be sure, additional context would be necessary.

Given the above inconsistencies, the safest induction from the provided examples without further context would be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to repeat two or three times. The exact number of repetitions may be influenced by other words or context not fully understood from the examples provided.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,108
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.
Based on the examples given, the non-word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Let's look at each example and its output to find a pattern:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: wif dax wif
   Output: red green red

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

In all instances where ""wif"" appears, it consistently translates to ""red."" There is no contextual change that affects the output assigned to ""wif."" It does not matter whether ""wif"" appears at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the input sequence; ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it should be translated to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input correlates directly with the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of position or surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be translated into a color. The context suggests that ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color that was most recently mentioned. Here is the deduction based on each example:

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output: green red green yellow yellow
- Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. Hence, the first instance of ""bluf"" is yellow.

Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red
- ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. Therefore, ""bluf"" is green in this instance.

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
- The first ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, making the first ""bluf"" blue.
- The second ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" corresponding to yellow, making the second ""bluf"" yellow.

Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- ""Bluf"" is again following ""zup,"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" becomes yellow.

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
- ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, therefore ""bluf"" is green here.

Taking all the above into account, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the word before it.
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color preceding it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", and results in three repetitions of ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" results in ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"", where ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" (yellow) and results in three ""yellow"" before ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"", where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), resulting in two more ""blue"" colors echoing the first one.
- The pattern is reaffirmed with ""zup walm wif"", yielding ""yellow yellow yellow red"", with ""walm"" creating three ""yellow"" after the initial ""zup"" (yellow).
- Finally, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"", where ""walm"" again results in three repetitions of the preceding color, which is ""blue"" from ""lug"".

Thus: walm -> three repetitions of the color preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,109
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to a specific color being represented in the output. Here's how ""lug"" translates across the given examples:

- wif lug zup walm wif lug: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- lug walm: blue blue blue
- lug: blue
- wif lug wif: red blue red
- lug bluf: blue blue

In each instance where ""lug"" is used in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. There are no counterexamples provided where ""lug"" corresponds to any other color or any other word. Therefore, the rule appears to be quite simple:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Hence, the meaning of ""lug"" in this context is ""blue"".

lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue.
Based on the examples provided, it is evident that the presence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each instance where ""dax"" is mentioned, regardless of what follows or proceeds it, ""green"" shows up in the output sequence at the corresponding position. 

Thus, the rule appears to be: dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in an input, it translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. More importantly, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". The other words, ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf,"" correspond to the colors ""yellow,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red"" respectively (though ""bluf"" is tricky because it corresponds to a double ""red"" in the first example, which may be a pattern or an exception). Since the word ""wif"" appears in different positions within the input strings and always results in ""red"" in the output, we can conclude that the word ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red,"" irrespective of its position or the context within the string.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we are looking for the meaning of ""zup"" in the context of a sequence of words that each correspond to a particular color in the output. Analyzing each instance where the word ""zup"" appears, it always correlates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Here is the observed pattern:
- ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green yellow""
- ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
- ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green""
- ""lug zup lug"" -> ""blue yellow blue""

It seems that each word (e.g., ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax"") corresponds to a particular color in the output sequence. Irrespective of other words, ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""

Hence, the rule is:
zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> red when following wif, otherwise blue.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" In all other instances, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
From the provided examples, we can induce the following observations:

- Each time the word ""walm"" appears in an input, the word ""red"" is used repeatedly in the output following the pattern before ""walm"".
- The number of ""red"" in the output corresponds to the number of words appearing before ""walm"" in the input, including ""walm"" itself:

  - In the first example, ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" There are three words before ""wif"", hence three ""yellow"" and one ""blue"" followed by one ""red"".
  - In the second example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" There are six words before ""walm"", hence the pattern ""green red yellow yellow red"" followed by three ""red"".
  - In the third example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" There are three words before the first ""walm"" (""zup lug walm""), hence three ""blue"", followed by three ""red"". The sequence ""wif walm"" at the end is treated as ""red red red"" because ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats this color red.
  - In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" Since ""wif"" is ""red"", ""walm"" causes repetition of ""red"" twice.
  - In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and the first ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""green"" two more times. Then the pattern follows normally for ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"" until the next ""walm"", which causes a repetition of ""blue"" two more times.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the immediate preceding color in the output to be repeated for a count equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"", including ""walm"" itself.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the immediate preceding color in the output, the number of times including and equal to the count of words before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,110
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax,"" let's first observe each input/output pair:

1. lug dax -> blue green
2. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
4. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
5. zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green

In cases 1 and 4, ""dax"" follows the words ""lug"" and ""zup"" which translate to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, and is followed by ""green."" In case 2, ""dax"" comes after ""bluf,"" which translates to ""yellow"" twice, and once more the output is ""green."" In case 3, ""dax"" is between two instances of ""bluf,"" and the output is ""green"" in the corresponding position. Finally, in case 5, ""dax"" is at the end after ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and is followed by ""green.""

From these observations, we can deduce that regardless of the words that come before or after ""dax,"" the output is consistently ""green."" Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems consistent in all instances. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""zup"" is independent of context or neighboring words in this particular set of examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, a pattern can be discerned where each nonce word corresponds to a color. When attempting to deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the output from each example where ""bluf"" is present and note its corresponding output color. Here are the instances where ""bluf"" appears and their corresponding output colors:

- dax bluf wif lug zup -> ""green green red blue yellow""
- wif bluf dax -> ""red red green""
- dax zup lug bluf -> ""green yellow blue blue""
- wif bluf zup bluf wif -> ""red red yellow yellow red""
- wif zup bluf lug walm -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""

From the observation we can see that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule:
bluf -> blue
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should examine how the word is used in relation to the output colors. Across the provided examples, observe how the color sequence changes before and after ""walm"" is included.

From the first input-output pair:
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red.""

It appears that every time ""walm"" is included, we see a sequence of ""red"" colors in the output that follows ""walm."" Let's apply this observation to the other examples.

From the second input-output pair:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
Here, there is no preceding color to look at (as ""lug"" is the first word), but ""walm"" itself generates a sequence of ""blue"" in the output.

From the third input-output pair:
- ""dax zup walm wif"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red.""
Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow red."" Notice that ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" and then a ""red.""

From the fourth input-output pair:
- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red.""
In this example, following ""walm"" with another ""walm"" seems to add more ""red"" colors.

From the fifth input-output pair:
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
Again, ""walm"" is followed by multiple ""red"" colors.

The rule that can explain all of these examples is that ""walm"" duplicates the next color that would have been outputted if ""walm"" was not present, and it does so three times. 

However, it is important to note a discrepancy in data: in the third and fourth examples, the repeated sequences are ""yellow yellow yellow red"" and ""red red red,"" which may indicate that ""walm"" could be about repeating the output from the preceding word(s) or the next word with the exception where the color should have been ""blue"" after ""lug"", but instead, we see ""blue blue blue"". There's an assumption that ""wif"" generates ""red"" and ""lug"" generates ""blue,"" but ""dax"" and ""zup"" each generate ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

So there is an inconsistency because ""lug"" alone generates one ""blue"" while ""lug walm"" generates three ""blue."" Because the latter sequence doesn't follow the duplication of ""blue"" color, but instead the triplication, without additional context, we may conclude that walm could mean ""repeat the next color three times,"" with a special rule for ""blue"" after ""lug,"" where it also repeats three times instead of duplicating.

Rule: walm -> repeat the next color three times (with an irregularity potentially occurring with the color blue after ""lug"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is mentioned, it is translated to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can notice a pattern in which the appearance of the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green."" Therefore, it seems that the rule is that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern that correlates each nonce word with a color in the output. For every instance of the word ""wif"", the color ""red"" appears in the output:

- wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
- dax wif -> green red
- wif -> red
- zup wif -> yellow red
- lug wif -> blue red

In all these examples, irrespective of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the other words present, the output associated with ""wif"" is consistently ""red"". Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the examples and their corresponding outputs:

Example 1:
- Input: lug walm zup walm
- Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

Example 2:
- Input: zup wif lug zup walm
- Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Example 3:
- Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
- Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Example 4:
- Input: wif walm zup
- Output: red red red yellow

Example 5:
- Input: zup dax
- Output: yellow green

From the examples provided, ""zup"" seems to correspond to yellow, but let's look closer. Every time ""zup"" appears, it seems to reset the output sequence to yellow, regardless of the previous pattern. After the word ""zup,"" the output sequence starts with yellow and then follows a pattern based on the words that come after ""zup.""

For instance, in Example 1, the sequence is ""blue blue blue"" until ""zup"" appears, after which it switches to ""yellow yellow yellow"" coinciding with the repetition of ""walm.""

In Example 2, ""zup"" appears first and the output starts with yellow. When ""zup"" appears again after ""lug,"" the sequence is reset to yellow again, meaning that ""zup"" resets the color sequence to start with yellow, and then the following words determine the next colors.

In Example 3, the output is yellow after each occurrence of ""zup,"" indicating another reset of the sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""zup"" resets the output sequence to start with yellow, followed by a pattern defined by the following words in the input.

So, zup -> meaning. Meaning is: Resets the output color sequence to start with yellow.
From the given examples, we can induce rules for the words 'lug', 'wif', 'zup', and 'bluf'. Each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. By examining the patterns, here are the rules deduced:

- 'lug' corresponds to ""blue""
- 'wif' corresponds to ""red""
- 'zup' corresponds to ""yellow""

Now, we seem to have two possible scenarios for 'bluf':

1. When 'bluf' immediately follows 'lug' or 'wif', it corresponds to an additional ""red"" in the output sequence.
2. When 'bluf' is at the end of the sequence or is immediately followed by 'zup', there is no direct corresponding color for it in the output.

Given this information, 'bluf' likely indicates that we should repeat the last color, unless it is directly followed by 'zup', in which case it indicates that no new color should be added.

Applying this rule to the examples:

- In ""lug wif bluf"", 'bluf' follows 'wif', so it repeats ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf wif"", 'bluf' is not followed by a color, thus it adds no new color but the pattern ""yellow yellow"" suggests that 'bluf' after 'zup' results in a repetition of ""yellow"".
- In ""zup bluf lug"", 'bluf' repeats the ""yellow"" from before and is followed by ‘lug’ which translates to ""blue"".
- In ""zup bluf"", 'bluf' follows 'zup' and it does not add a new color, sticking with ""yellow yellow"".
- In ""lug wif bluf lug wif"", 'bluf' follows 'wif' and repeats ""red"", and then the pattern continues after it with ""blue red"" as per 'lug' and 'wif'.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' means to repeat the previous color, but if it follows 'zup' or is at the end of a sequence, no new color is to be added.

Rule:
bluf -> repeat the last mentioned color (or add no new color when following 'zup' or at the end)
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the immediately preceding color. I will evaluate each instance to check this hypothesis.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which yields ""yellow."" As such, ""walm"" generates two additional ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""zup walm dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which yields ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" corresponding to ""red,"" and ""walm"" outputs two more ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and results in ""walm"" producing two more ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" the output is ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" We can see two instances of ""walm"" here. The first is after ""lug"" (blue), which results in two more ""blue,"" and the second is after ""zup"" (yellow), producing two additional ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it, producing two more instances of that same color in the sequence.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples and the intended use of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's examine the output that surfaces each time ""lug"" is present in the input:

- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
- zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
- lug dax -> blue green
- wif lug -> red blue
- wif lug wif -> red blue red

In each instance where ""lug"" is used, ""blue"" appears in the output. Given that ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" irrespective of other words' presence or position, this suggests that ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue."" 

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples given:

- When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" ""wif"" is translated to ""red,"" and ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" ""dax"" is still translated to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green.""
- The word ""bluf"" appears to consistently translate to ""red.""

From this, we can induce that the translation of ""dax"" is independent of its position with respect to other words. Hence:

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each given example.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the outputs and how they correspond to the inputs where ""zup"" appears:

1. wif zup -> red yellow
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" hence ""zup"" likely corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
   ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""green,"" so again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and since ""zup"" appears first, it is reasonable to presume ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
   We have ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Zup"" must again correspond to ""yellow.""

5. lug zup dax lug -> blue yellow green blue
   As established, ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and so ""zup"" fits consistently with its previous correspondence to ""yellow.""

From the given examples, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: In every given example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples given, it appears that each unique word is associated with a unique color:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

The word ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. Here’s the analysis of each example to show this pattern:

1. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   The ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to blue.

2. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   The ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to red.

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   The ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to red.

4. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   The ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow.

5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   The ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to green.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
The presence and meaning of ""walm"" must be deduced from the examples and their corresponding outputs. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - The presence of ""lug"" correlates with the color blue, while ""zup"" before ""lug"" changes the subsequent ""lug"" to yellow.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" correlates with green, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""wif"" with red. After ""walm,"" the color red repeats three times.

3. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" with yellow again, followed by ""dax"" with green. After ""walm,"" we have repeating green.

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - This example doesn't help much with deciphering ""walm"" but supports the previous assignments of ""zup"" to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue.

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - Similar to example 3, we see repeating green after ""walm,"" followed by ""zup"" with yellow again and ""wif"" with red.

From the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates that the last color before it should be repeated three times. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the last mentioned color and repeats it thrice in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,113
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is outputted. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the nonce word ""lug"" and the color ""blue"" in the examples given.
Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. For each instance of ""dax"" in the input, the output reflects a corresponding ""green.""

Thus, the rule is: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the following pattern is observable:

- ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"".
- Other words (""lug"", ""walm"", ""zup"") lead to different color outputs (""blue"" for ""lug"", ""blue"" for ""walm"", ""yellow"" for ""zup"").
- The repetition of ""wif"" corresponds to a repeated ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the induction from these examples suggests that:

Rule: ""wif"" -> meaning ""red"".
Based on the given examples, we can try to infer the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup"". To do this, we can look at the positioning and repetition of inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when followed by ""lug wif dax bluf wif"".
2. In the second example, ""zup"" alone causes the repetition of ""yellow"" three times when flanked by ""walm"" which corresponds to ""blue"" in a repeated manner.
3. In the third example, ""zup"" repeatedly corresponds to ""yellow"" and alternates with ""lug"" which consistently corresponds to ""blue"", and it ends with ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"".
4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" leads to a double ""yellow"" when it follows ""dax wif"" and is followed by ""bluf wif walm"", where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (repeated) and ""dax"" to ""green"".
5. In the fifth example, following ""dax bluf"", ""zup"" results in a single ""yellow"".

From these examples, it seems like:

- When ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to ""yellow"".
- The word before ""zup"" does not affect its output.
- The word after ""zup"" does not seem to affect its output, but there is a repeated color for ""wif"" and ""bluf"" after ""zup"" which corresponds to red and green respectively.
- The presence of ""zup"" does not seem to cause the preceding color word to repeat like the word ""walm"" does.

Considering all these observations, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"", regardless of its position or the context given by surrounding words. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, it copies the color that is associated with the preceding word.

- dax bluf -> green green
- dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- wif bluf dax -> red red green
- lug bluf -> blue blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color immediately preceding it three additional times. This is evident from the fact that whenever ""walm"" appears, the color that comes out in the output is repeated three times (including its original appearance before ""walm"").

Here's how the rule applies to each given input example:

- Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
  Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
  Rule application: Blue (""lug"") is repeated three more times after ""walm"".

- Input: zup wif dax walm
  Output: yellow red green green green
  Rule application: Green (""dax"") is repeated three more times after ""walm"".

- Input: zup wif walm
  Output: yellow red red red
  Rule application: Red (""wif"") is repeated three more times after ""walm"".

- Input: wif dax lug walm
  Output: red green blue blue blue
  Rule application: Blue (""lug"") is repeated three more times after ""walm"".

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  Rule application: Yellow (""zup"") is repeated three more times after ""walm"".

Hence, the rule appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color that immediately precedes ""walm"" three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup lug
    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow blue,True,114
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" This can be inferred from seeing ""lug"" always translating to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the information provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

For example:
- In ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red"", the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- In ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"", ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", and since the output is ""green green green"", it reinforces that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" as well.
- In ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green"", ""dax"" appears twice and is translated to ""green"" both times.
- In ""lug dax lug"" -> ""blue green blue"", ""dax"" is between two ""lug""s, and in the output, ""green"" is between two ""blue""s.
- In ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"", ""dax"" is positioned before the final ""lug"", translating to ""green"" right before ""blue"".

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze the presence of ""wif"" in different context within the given examples and the corresponding output to isolate the effect of ""wif.""

1. Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
2. Input: dax wif walm | Output: green red red red
3. Input: dax zup wif zup | Output: green yellow red yellow
4. Input: zup bluf wif  dax wif zup | Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
5. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow

Considering these examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""wif"" we see the color ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" then ""wif"" and ""walm"" follows, but ""red"" is repeated four times. 
- In the third example, after ""wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" which comes after ""red"" from ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears twice and each time it is followed by ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears at the start, and again, we see a ""red.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", as every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output sequence in the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, zup seems to correspond to the color yellow. Each time zup appears in the input, the corresponding output is yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color that was previously mentioned in the sequence. Here's how it breaks down:

- In the first example, ""wif lug zup bluf"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color that came right before it, which is ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red."" ""Bluf"" again corresponds to the color that came right before it, ""red.""

- In the third example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once more.

- In the fourth example, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green."" ""Bluf"" takes the color ""green"" from before it.

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""bluf"" takes the color ""yellow"" from right before it, again showing it echoes the previously mentioned color.

Rule: bluf -> the color mentioned immediately before ""bluf"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to replicate the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times. 

Let's break down each example to find the rule:

- Input: lug walm 
  Output: blue blue blue
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and when ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

- Input: wif walm zup
  Output: red red red yellow
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and immediately after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times, followed by ""yellow"" which is the color for ""zup"".

- Input: zup lug walm wif dax
  Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so when ""walm"" follows ""lug"", ""blue"" is repeated three times. Other colors correspond to their respective words.

- Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
  Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
  Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" gives a triple ""blue"". The color for ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""wif"" continues to correspond to ""red"".

- Input: zup dax walm
  Output: yellow green green green
  ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and when ""walm"" follows ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that precedes it and repeats that color output three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,115
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, each instance where the nonce word ""dax"" occurs, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. The other words seem to correlate with their own colors consistently: ""lug"" with blue, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""wif"" with red. The word ""walm"" seems a bit more complex, as its presence multiplies the instance of red, but the word ""dax"" remains consistently linked to green irrespective of the number of ""walm."" 

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds directly to ""red"" in the output. There are also other color words (e.g., ""dax"" and ""bluf"") which correspond to different colors (e.g., ""green"" and ""red"" respectively). There is also a case where ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

Here are the rules I've induced from the examples:

- ""wif"" always results in ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"".
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"".

Rule: wif -> ""red""
According to the given examples, we can see that each instance of a nonce word correlates to a specific color:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the corresponding color in the output is ""yellow"".
- Similarly, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- The word ""walm"" seems to have a repetitive pattern in the second example, outputting ""green"" three times in a row, indicating it could mean a repetition of the previous color mentioned.

Based on the above observations, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems consistent across all examples:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> duplicate the color word that precedes it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows a color-coded word (lug, dax, wif), it replicates that word's associated color. In the given examples, ""lug"" represents the color ""blue,"" ""dax"" represents ""green,"" and ""wif"" represents ""red."" Thus, ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to be outputted twice.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern preceding and following it in the given examples, alongside the output colors.

Here's the analysis:

- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
- ""lug walm zup"" -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""wif walm zup walm"" -> Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax wif walm"" -> Output: green red red red
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

From the examples above, we can deduce the following:

1. Every time the word ""walm"" appears, the color before it changes.
2. ""zup"" always follows ""walm"" and then the output is yellow.
3. When ""walm"" is present, the color changes, and for every unique word before ""walm,"" the corresponding color is repeated three times before it changes to yellow.
4. When ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug"" appear before ""walm,"" the corresponding colors are green, red, and blue respectively, and these colors are repeated thrice.
5. When ""walm"" appears twice, the pattern repeats after the yellow.

Using the patterns, we can infer that ""walm"" is a transforming function that changes the following:

- It repeats the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.
- It then changes the output to yellow, regardless of the previous color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word thrice, then change to yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,116
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue, regardless of context within the given examples.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" I will analyze its appearance and the corresponding outputs in the examples provided.

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output includes the color ""green.""
- Regardless of the word following ""dax,"" the output is green for every occurrence of ""dax.""

Now let us examine the implications of ""dax"" when it's followed by different words:

1. In the first example, ""dax zup dax"" maps to ""green yellow green."" Since both instances of ""dax"" map to ""green,"" it suggests ""dax"" maps to ""green"" independently of the context.

2. In the second example, ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" maps to ""green red green yellow yellow."" Again, both ""dax"" map to ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" directly corresponds to ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""dax lug bluf wif"" maps to ""green blue blue red."" The word ""dax"" at the beginning maps to ""green,"" so the context of following words does not seem to affect the output for ""dax.""

4. The fourth example ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green."" Here, we don't know the individual meaning of ""walm,"" but we can see that ""dax"" still results in ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" maps to ""yellow red green green green blue."" Even when ""dax"" is preceded by different nonce words (in this case, ""zup wif""), the output immediately following ""dax"" is ""green,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these observations, we can induce that the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green,"" irrespective of the position or surrounding context within the string.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the rule that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. Additionally, it seems that ""wif"" does not alter the translation of the words that follow it to their respective colors.

Here is the analysis for each example:

1. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to a sequence of ""red"" but we need more examples to confirm its exact meaning.

3. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems to still correspond to ""red red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

4. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

5. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems to consistently correspond to ""red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Based on this analysis, we can formulate the rule as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"" and other words from the given examples, we can analyze the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

In every example where only ""zup"" appears as an input, the output is singular - ""yellow"". Therefore, the most straightforward deduction would be that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Next, we see that additional words in the string produce additional colors in the output. Following is an analysis to determine the corresponding colors:

1. ""lug"" seems to consistently result in the output ""blue.""
2. ""wif"" and ""walm"" both precede the same color ""red,"" but since ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue,"" it seems ""wif"" could mean ""repeat the next color twice,"" and ""walm"" then would be ""red.""
3. ""bluf"" appears once followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow blue,"" which suggests ""bluf"" possibly means ""yellow,"" as it precedes ""yellow's"" known output color from the ""zup"" input.
4. ""dax"" precedes the color ""green"" in the output.

Based on this analysis, we can infer the following rules:

Rule:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> repeat the next color twice
- walm -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green. When ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" the output is green. However, when ""bluf"" stands alone or is not immediately preceded by ""dax,"" it does not map to a consistent color in the output. Given that the sequences before ""bluf"" differ and sometimes include ""lug"" which maps to blue, ""wif"" which maps to red, and ""dax"" which maps to green, and considering their outputs, the contextual connection for ""bluf"" seems to uniquely affect the output directly after ""dax.""

So, from these examples, we can observe the following rule:

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" it corresponds to the color green. In other contexts, the meaning of ""bluf"" is not clearly defined based on the given examples except that 'bluf' comes after 'lug' or stands alone, it does not translate to green in the output.

bluf -> green (when following ""dax"")
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example, when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the resulting color is ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to be repeated three times. 

Let's analyze the examples to deduce the rule:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
Here, the color associated with ""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" occurs three times.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
Here, the color associated with ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
In this sequence, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the corresponding color ""red"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
This example is the same as the first one and further confirms the rule.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The examples provided consistently translate the nonce word ""lug"" to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""green."" Additionally, each iteration of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to equate to a repeated ""blue"" except when following ""dax,"" where it gives a repeated ""green."" The word ""zup"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" but only a single example for these words is provided which may not be enough to generalize a rule for them, but for now they show consistency in their respective outputs.

Rule: dax -> green

Additional observed rules based on limited data:
- lug -> blue
- walm after dax -> repeated green corresponding to the number of letters in ""walm""
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
To discern the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze each pair of inputs and outputs, looking for consistent patterns:

1. ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green""
2. ""zup wif lug"" translates to ""yellow red blue""
3. ""zup dax zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green yellow red""
4. ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow""
5. ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow""

If we analyze the positions where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output, we can attempt to identify a pattern:

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears between ""lug"" and ""dax"" and corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears after ""zup lug"" and corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears at the end after ""zup dax zup"" and translates to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" follows ""lug bluf"" and corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is at the beginning, followed by ""bluf zup,"" and it corresponds to ""red.""

Considering the consistent pattern in all provided instances where the output for ""wif"" is always ""red,"" we can conclude that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" This is evidenced by the consistent substitution of ""yellow"" wherever ""zup"" appears in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, bluf appears at different positions within the inputs, and the output colors do not seem to align with a particular color consistently when bluf is used. However, observing the colors that follow the appearance of bluf in the output sequence can provide some insights into the potential rule of its meaning. Here is the analysis:

1. Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which results in two greens, suggesting that the position after ""dax"" might affect the color outcome when ""bluf"" is present, adding a green.
   
2. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" is at the end, which follows ""zup,"" and it results in yellow, similar to what ""zup"" generates.

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" when ""wif"" is after ""walm."" This results in two reds, suggesting that ""bluf"" might be amplifying the effect of ""wif"" here.

4. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""Bluf"" again occurs at the end. The position of ""bluf"" following ""zup"" keeps generating yellow, but it does not provide further insight.
   
5. Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - ""Bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" which might suggest that ""bluf"" could influence the color shift for ""dax"" to green.

Based on the above, we can extract the following potential rule:

Rule: ""Bluf"" may either modify the color outcome based on its position relative to the surrounding words or simply carry the color attribute of the word immediately preceding it when it is the last word. Given the inconsistency in resulting colors and the provided examples, it is difficult to assign a single, definitive meaning to ""bluf."" However, when it is not the last word, it seems to generate the green color, hinting at a potential relationship with preceding words (possibly ""dax""). When it is the last word, it appears to repeat the color of the word right before it.

Therefore, a tentative rule induction could be:
bluf -> meaning: When following ""dax"", contributes to a green color; when at the end of a sequence, repeats the color of the preceding word; otherwise, its influence is uncertain and may depend on different rules that are not clear from the given examples.
walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repeated color associated with the preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color thrice.
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" means ""blue,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""zup"" once again means ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color yellow thrice, as it follows ""zup.""
- ""lug walm dax"" comes out as ""blue blue blue green,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" repeated thrice because of ""walm,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" ends up being ""green red red red blue yellow,"" where ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""red"" three times.

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color denoted by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green."" In each instance where the word ""dax"" appears, the output includes the word ""green"" in the corresponding position.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in all provided examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that each unique non-zup word corresponds to a unique color, and the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each input and corresponding output, and try to figure out the underlying rule:

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

2. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red

3. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue

In each output, the word that follows ""bluf"" is the same color as the one that precedes ""bluf."" However, ""bluf"" is not just repeating the preceding color, as in some cases, it appears to practically ""default"" to a specific color when a new word follows ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" yields ""green,"" the same color as ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" results in ""red,"" the same color as ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow,"" the same color as ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, the second occurrence of ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" but it still results in ""blue,"" which hints that ""bluf"" might not mean the color following it.
- In the fifth example, it gives ""yellow,"" the same as the preceding ""zup.""

Looking closely, you can see that when ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it takes on the color of the word that precedes it. But if ""bluf"" is the last word or not followed by another word that has an assigned color, it defaults to ""yellow.""

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is at the end or not followed by a colored word, it defaults to ""yellow"".

bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word, default to ""yellow"" if there is no colored word after.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in each input and their corresponding outputs.

1. In the first input, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Every ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" every ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red."" Given that, ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of the color for the word immediately preceding it.

2. The second input, ""lug zup dax walm,"" results in ""blue yellow green green green."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" while ""walm"" appears to extend the color ""green"" two more times.

3. The third input, ""lug walm zup walm,"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word right before it, ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow).

4. The fourth input, ""zup walm dax,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Similar to the previous examples, ""walm"" repeats the color linked to ""zup"" (yellow).

5. In the fifth input, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" repeated the color ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue yellow blue,yellow blue yellow blue,True,119
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""lug"" in the input correlates to the color ""blue"" in the output. This allows us to conclude that ""lug"" means the color blue. Observing the other words in the inputs and their corresponding colors in the outputs, it is clear that other words are also associated with different colors:

- ""walm"" correlates to the color yellow.
- ""wif"" correlates to the color red.
- ""dax"" correlates to the color green.
- ""zup"" also correlates to the color yellow (as seen in example 5).

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the color ""green"" appears at that same position in the output sequence.

Here is the rule induction based on the provided examples:

1. Input: zup dax wif zup -> Output: yellow green red yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red.

2. Input: lug dax wif -> Output: blue green red
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and again, ""wif"" to red.

3. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

4. Input: zup dax zup lug -> Output: yellow green yellow blue
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue.

5. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and it seems that ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow based on this example.

Based on this information, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, wif translates to the color red. 

Rule: Whenever the word 'wif' appears in the input, the word 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""blue."" Here are the observations supporting this:

In all cases where ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output:

- 2nd and 4th words in the first input correspond to the 2nd and 5th colors (both are ""bluf"" and ""blue"")
- 2nd word in the second input is ""bluf,"" and the 2nd color in the output is ""blue""
- 3rd word in the third input is ""bluf,"" and the 3rd color in the output is ""blue""
- 4th word in the fourth input is ""bluf,"" and the 4th color in the output is ""blue""
- 2nd word in the fifth input is ""bluf,"" and the output is a repetition of ""blue""

Thus, it is consistent that ""bluf"" means ""blue."" Here is the rule as requested:

Rule: bluf -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns associated with each example.

- When ""wif walm zup"" occurs together, it produces ""red red red yellow.""
- When ""lug walm"" occurs, it results in ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""zup walm"" by itself, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" all occurs together, the outputs are separated by the occurrence of ""lug,"" producing ""blue"" followed by the recurring pattern from ""wif walm zup.""

From this, we can gather that ""walm"" has an effect that involves repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, producing three repetitions of that color's output. This is further supported by the standalone example ""lug walm,"" which outputs ""blue blue blue"" without an associated ""zup"" or ""wif"" to follow the ""walm."" This suggests that ""walm"" does not need a following context to enact its repeating effect.

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, resulting in three consecutive outputs of that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,120
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the words that come before or after it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in an input, ""red"" appears in the output. Also, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" as seen in the presence of ""blue"" in the outputs whenever ""lug"" appears.

Let's break down the examples to identify this pattern:

- Input: wif lug | Output: red blue - ""wif"" is before ""red"" and ""lug"" is before ""blue.""
- Input: wif | Output: red - Without ""lug,"" ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""
- Input: dax lug wif lug | Output: green blue red blue - ""wif"" is before ""red"" while both occurrences of ""lug"" are before ""blue,"" ""dax"" might correspond to ""green.""
- Input: zup wif lug zup walm | Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow - ""wif"" is before ""red,"" ""lug"" is before ""blue,"" and ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" possibly contributing to repeating ""yellow.""
- Input: wif lug zup bluf | Output: red blue yellow yellow - Again, ""wif"" is before ""red,"" ""lug"" is before ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is before ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Each unique word corresponds to a unique color name: ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" is also yellow. There is a direct mapping between each nonce word and a color.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will compare the input with the corresponding output to identify patterns.

Looking at the first example:
Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""bluf"" in this context appears right before a ""red,"" suggesting it alters or refers to the following word's output.

The second example:
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" but the output is ""yellow red."" It doesn't seem to always turn the following into ""red.""

The third example:
Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

In this example, ""bluf"" comes at the end after ""zup"" (yellow), and the corresponding output is ""yellow."" This might imply that ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""

The fourth example corroborates this:
Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green

""bluf"" follows a ""dax"" (green), but the output is ""green,"" the same as the ""dax"" before it, and is followed by ""red,"" the color defined by ""wif."" It should be noted that ""bluf"" does not turn the preceding ""dax"" into a ""green,"" it is already green, but there seems to be a pattern with the color that follows ""bluf.""

The final example reinforces the pattern:
Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems to again result in ""red,"" matching the color represented by ""wif.""

Taking all examples into account, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output color of the word that immediately follows it. However, there is a catch: when ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence with no following word, as in the third example, it defaults to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately follows it, or ""yellow"" if it is the last word in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated three times in the output, with the last instance being the color associated with that word.

- In the first example, ""wif"" is red, so ""walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
- In the second example, ""dax wif"" would normally translate to ""green red"", but with ""walm"" preceding ""dax"", it results in ""yellow yellow yellow green red"".
- In the third example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green"", with ""lug"" being ""blue"" and ""walm dax"" being ""blue blue green"" following the established rule.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" simply translates to ""red red red"", following the same pattern but without an extra color word at the end.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", again following the pattern.

So, the rule is: 
walm -> Repeats the color of the following word three times, with the last instance being the color associated with that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" refers to a color, specifically green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Here is a rule that can be deduced:

Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Other words correspond to other colors; for example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
From the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Every instance of the term ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of the other words present. Hence, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the patterns identified from the examples, the rule for the nonce word 'zup' seems consistent. In each output, the word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'. The other words also have consistent translations to colors. For instance, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'dax' corresponds to 'green'. Therefore, the rule for 'zup' is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> The color represented by the word that precedes it. If the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"", then ""bluf"" means ""blue"". If it's ""dax"", then ""bluf"" means ""green"". If it's ""zup"", then ""bluf"" means ""yellow"". If ""bluf"" is the first word or no recognizable color word precedes it, then it repeats the color it stands for.

To summarize:

- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""bluf"", following ""wif"", takes on the color red represented by ""wif"".
- ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""bluf"" repeats the color blue as it follows ""lug"".
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red"" for the same reason as above, with ""wif"" translating to red.
- ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red"" because ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it (which is ""dax"") so it's green, then ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red.
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"", following it, repeats the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it multiple times. Here is the breakdown:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"". The output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". The output is ""green"" repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   - ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" which is ""green"" three times, followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"".

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"". The output is ""blue"" repeated three times, followed by ""wif"" and ""bluf"" which correspond to ""red"".

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"". The output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Regardless of the position or the surrounding words, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules for the word ""dax"" and other words in the inputs:

- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" maps to ""green""
- ""bluf"" maps to ""green""

Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""green,"" regardless of its position or the other words around it. Hence, we can conclude that in this context, ""dax"" represents the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"". There is no example where ""wif"" corresponds to a different color or set of colors, and its position in a string of words does not appear to modify its associated color. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, it is translated to the color ""red"".
To identify the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the input and output pairs:

- Whenever the input contains the word ""zup,"" the output contains ""yellow.""
- The word ""zup"" does not change its corresponding output based on its position in the input sequence; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of what precedes or follows it.
- Other words in the input correlate with different colors: ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""bluf"" with another ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""

Based on the information above, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be consistent and independent of other words. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" one can analyze the patterns of correspondence between the input and output sequences. Here is the analysis on a case-by-case basis:

- In the first input ""zup bluf wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second input ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" However, the second occurrence of ""bluf"" now corresponds to ""blue"" rather than ""yellow.""
- The third input ""zup bluf wif walm"" contains previously seen words and follows the same pattern, except ""walm"" seems to be causing an output of three ""red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" might reinforce or triple the color corresponding to the preceding word.
- The fourth input ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" does not provide further consistent information about ""bluf,"" as it corresponds to ""yellow"" here, just as ""zup"" does.
- The fifth input ""wif bluf dax walm"" shows ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and ""walm"" once again reinforcing or tripling the preceding color.

From the analysis, it is evident that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output. It can correspond to yellow, blue, or red depending on the context. However, one possible pattern that could be deduced is that ""bluf"" might take on the color value of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. For instance, when followed by ""wif,"" it plays the ""red"" role, and when following ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) or preceding ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), it either carries over the yellow or transitions into the color that follows.

As a rule induction system, given the examples provided, the rule may read as:

Rule: bluf takes on the color value of the word that follows it, unless influenced by the word ""walm"" which triples the color value, or if it is at the end of the sequence, in which case it takes on the value ""yellow.""

However, the available data is not sufficient for a definitive and consistent rule without exception, as there is some inconsistency in how ""bluf"" is translated, particularly in the example ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" both times, which doesn't fit the proposed rule. More data would be needed to confirm any rule induction without doubt.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be related to repeating the last color mentioned in the sequence a number of times. The number of repetitions appears to be three, regardless of the color that comes before ""walm."" Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" - the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to two more instances of ""blue"".
2. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again adds two more instances of ""yellow"".
3. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" creates two additional instances of ""green"".
4. When ""walm"" appears after two different colors, as in ""lug zup dax walm,"" it uses the color of the last word before it (""dax"" -> ""green"") and repeats it three times, not just twice (""green green green"").
5. Similarly, in ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" where ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" has no direct translation but may be assumed to be a mistake for ""blue"" (matching the pattern of one word for one color) and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" after which ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in total.

Rule: If X is the color word before ""walm"" and Y is the color that X represents, then ""X walm"" translates to ""Y Y Y"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" seems to be consistent across all instances. The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example given, no matter its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color ""red"". Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is part of the corresponding output. However, the association between the other words and colors is not as straightforward. ""Zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" appears to result in a double ""yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""wif"", but it corresponds to ""blue blue"" when it comes without ""wif"" preceding it. ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in all the examples given.

The patterns suggest that ""wif"" itself may signal a basic output of ""red"", and can also affect the output of some words that follow it. Without further examples or clarification, it is difficult to deduce how ""wif"" affects the words that follow it, if at all, beyond the immediate observation that it outputs ""red"" when it appears. As such, the clearest rule we can establish at this point is simply:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, where ""zup"" appears and its corresponding output, it is possible to deduce the meaning. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green"". In this sequence, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" also to ""green."" We can see that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

2. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The word ""bluf"" isn't defined elsewhere, but ""lug"" continues to correspond to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow."" Here ""zup"" again correlates with ""yellow,"" seen from its positioning between ""blue"" and the second group of ""yellow.""

3. ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow."" In this sequence, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Zup"" once again aligns with ""yellow"" given its position between ""green"" and ""yellow.""

4. ""lug zup dax lug"" translates to ""blue yellow green blue."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Here ""zup"" is in between ""blue"" and ""green,"" matching with ""yellow.""

5. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" ""Wif"" is correlated with ""red,"" and in the absence of other context, ""zup"" is the word left to correspond to ""yellow.""

Therefore, based on the inputs given and their corresponding outputs, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", we should look at the position where it appears and the corresponding output color. Here are the observations:

1. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
2. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
5. lug wif bluf -> blue red red

Looking at the output colors corresponding to ""bluf"", we have the colors yellow, red, and red. To deduce the pattern, let's look more closely at the examples:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears last in the sequence (example 1 and 3), the output color is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (examples 2 and 5), it takes the color red.
- When ""bluf"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" and ""lug"" (example 4), it also produces the color red.

Considering that ""bluf"" produces red when it directly follows another color word (blue or red from ""lug"" and ""wif"") but produces yellow when it’s the last word or follows a non-color word (""dax"" or ""zup""), the meaning seems to be context-dependent rather than a fixed color.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

- If ""bluf"" directly follows a color word (like lug = blue or wif = red), ""bluf"" mirrors the color word that precedes it (producing red in the given examples).
- If ""bluf"" follows a non-color word or appears at the end of a sequence, it defaults to yellow.

Rule: bluf -> meaning:
- Follows color word: mirrors the color of the preceding word.
- Else: defaults to yellow.
walm -> repetition of the previous word's corresponding color

Rule: When walm appears after a color-word, it causes the output to repeat the color that maps to the word preceding walm. For example, 'zup' maps to 'yellow,' so 'zup walm' causes the output to be 'yellow yellow yellow.' Similarly, 'lug' maps to 'blue,' so 'lug walm' results in 'blue blue blue.' The repetition count including the original word appears to always be three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow blue,True,124
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green."" Here is the rule deduced from the given examples:

Rule: dax -> green
Meaning: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding location in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There's no variation in its meaning regardless of its position in the input sequence, nor does it seem to depend on the presence or absence of other words. Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward.

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" means ""yellow.""
bluf -> color repetition. The word before bluf dictates the color that will be repeated twice.

Rule: The word preceding ""bluf"" determines the specific color that is to be outputted twice. For instance, ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" ""wif"" results in ""red red,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow."" If there are two words before ""bluf,"" each one is translated into its corresponding color, and they are both repeated once, as in the case of ""zup lug bluf"" which outputs ""yellow blue blue.""
Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the previous word should be repeated three times.

Explanation:

1. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" which suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that comes before it, three times.
   
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" following the same logic as the first example, it can be deduced that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" dictates a triple repetition of that color.

3. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" so following our established rule, ""wif"" translates to red and ""walm"" again requires the color be said three times.

4. In the complex case ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"", the result is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here we can break down as follows:
   - ""wif walm"" gives us ""red red red""
   - ""zup"" changes the color to yellow (single occurrence, no ""walm"" follows)
   - ""lug"" changes the color to blue 
   - ""zup walm"" goes back to yellow, with ""walm"" causing the triple repetition, confirming our rule as it is consistent with previous examples.

Therefore, walm indicates a repetition of the previous color word it follows, three times.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug
    ",Output: green blue red blue,green blue red blue,True,125
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let us examine each pair of input and output, focusing on the presence of the word ""lug"" and its corresponding output.

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" directly follows it, corresponding to ""blue"".

2. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and each occurrence of ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"". Also, ""walm"" seems to correspond to double ""blue"".

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   In this example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" converting the ""walm"" output to triple ""blue"".

4. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" again. ""lug"" appears after ""bluf"", and the pair ""bluf lug"" converts to a double ""blue green"".

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""lug"" follows and is ""blue,"" while ""zup"" and ""bluf"" each seem to correspond to ""yellow"".

Based on the input-output analysis, ""lug"" appears to consistently correspond to the color ""blue"". However, there are some additional intricacies:

- When ""lug"" appears after ""wif,"" it outputs a single ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" appears after ""dax,"" it outputs a single ""blue"" each time.
- When ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" it increases the count of ""blue"" corresponding to ""walm"" by one.
- When ""lug"" appears after ""bluf,"" it does not change the output from ""yellow"".

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", and when it precedes ""walm,"" it augments the ""blue"" output by one.

lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems fairly straightforward:

dax -> green

Every instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Thus, the rule is: Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, it means ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word wif:

wif -> repetition of the color associated with the following word. 

The color association seems to be as follows:

- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- walm -> red (and adding ""zup"" seems to indicate yellow following the reds)

Therefore, when wif precedes a color-associated word, the output is the color associated with that word, repeated once for each time the color-word appears after wif.

Rule: wif -> Repeat the color associated with the next word.
zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the provided examples. 

- Example 1: ""zup lug bluf wif"" translated to ""yellow blue blue red""
- Example 2: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translated to ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
- Example 3: ""wif bluf lug"" translated to ""red red blue""
- Example 4: ""wif dax zup bluf"" translated to ""red green yellow yellow""
- Example 5: ""dax bluf wif"" translated to ""green green red""

From these examples, we can analyze which parts of the input correlate with certain color outputs in the output:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""yellow.""
- ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" in the second example and results in two instances of the color ""red"" following the output corresponding to ""bluf."" 
- Similarly, in the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by no other input word but results in a second ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and if ""bluf"" is followed by another word, particularly ""wif,"" the color it represents is repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> yellow, and when followed by another word, particularly ""wif,"" its corresponding color (""yellow"") is repeated in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down the inputs and their corresponding outputs to look for patterns.

1. dax zup walm wif walm
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

2. zup walm dax lug
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

3. lug dax walm wif
- Output: blue green green green red

4. dax walm
- Output: green green green

5. dax walm
- Output: green green green

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color of the word immediately preceding it. Here's the reasoning:

- In example 1, walm follows zup, and the color yellow is repeated twice after zup.
- In example 2, walm follows zup again, and the color yellow is seen once more after the first instance of yellow.
- In examples 4 and 5, walm directly follows dax, and the color green is repeated twice.
- In example 3, walm follows dax, and the color green is repeated once more after the first green.

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated in the output an additional two times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" to be repeated twice more.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,126
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Here are the mappings from the examples:
- lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- dax -> green
- dax -> green
- wif walm dax -> red red red green
- zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"" regardless of the other words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.
To induce the rule for the nonce word ""wif,"" let's first identify the common output whenever ""wif"" is present in the input.

1. Input: wif zup | Output: red yellow
2. Input: dax zup wif zup | Output: green yellow red yellow
3. Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
4. Input: dax lug wif bluf | Output: green blue red red
5. Input: lug wif bluf | Output: blue red red

Whenever ""wif"" appears:
- In the first example, it precedes ""zup,"" and the output is ""red"" before the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is before the second ""zup"" and the output again has ""red"" before the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output has ""red"" before the colors associated with ""lug"" and ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" and the output has ""red"" before the color associated with ""bluf,"" which is ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""bluf,"" and the output begins with the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" followed by ""red,"" corresponding to ""wif,"" and then ""red"" again for ""bluf.""

From these observations, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input string. It neither combines with both the preceding and following words in any visible systematic way nor modifies the output in a positional manner. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be deduced as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context it is used in. There does not seem to be any additional complexity in the meaning or use of the word 'zup' from the examples provided.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it in the input list.

Rule: If a color word (e.g. ""lug"" for blue, ""zup"" for yellow) is followed by ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" repeats the color word that came before it.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
   (The word before walm is ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so the output is green repeated three times.)

2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
   (The word before walm is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so the output is red repeated three times.)

3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
   (The word before walm is ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, so the output is blue repeated three times.)

4. dax walm -> green green green
   (The word before walm is ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so the output is green repeated three times.)

5. dax wif walm -> green red red red
   (The word before walm is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so the output is red repeated three times.)

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,127
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Every time the word ""lug"" appears in an input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze each instance where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output to deduce a rule for the meaning of ""dax"". 

In all instances, the appearance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Here is a breakdown:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

2. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" here as well.

3. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green"" again.

4. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   Here ""dax"" also leads to ""green"" as the first color.

5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more.

No matter the context, ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: Every occurrence of the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the words that precede it. Moreover, each of the other nonce words - dax, zup, and walm - correspond to their own specific colors. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and each instance of the word ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow"" but with repetition based on its own occurrence, meaning if ""walm"" appears twice, it translates to ""yellow yellow."" The position of ""wif"" at the end of the sequence consistently results in the color ""red"" being added to the end of the color sequence in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".

As the first word in the sequence, ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"". No matter the position of ""zup"" in the sequence, it consistently results in ""yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" is not context-dependent but has a fixed meaning.

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow. The meaning is consistent regardless of context within the given sequences.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the output for each example where ""bluf"" is present.

1. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green""
2. ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" -> ""red blue blue red yellow""
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
5. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""

Here are the observations:
- In examples 1, 4, and 5, the word following ""bluf"" is not present. Here, ""bluf"" appears to result in ""green.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" in this case is also ""red.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by no other word, and the output is ""yellow,"" which matches the preceding word ""zup.""

So based on the examples, it seems the rule could be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it. However, when ""bluf"" is at the end or is not preceded by a color word with a clear output, it defaults to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> if a color word precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is the same color as the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is at the end or there's no clear color word before ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" defaults to ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we must look for patterns associated with its use in different contexts within the provided examples. Let's consider each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and its corresponding color is ""blue"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the beginning and end.

2. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" with both corresponding to ""yellow"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   ""Walm"" comes after ""lug"" once again, with the color ""blue"" following. Also, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and leads to a repeated ""yellow"". Subsequently, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and leads to repeated ""red"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and we see repeated ""red"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for the word ""walm"":

- ""Walm"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it until a new color word appears.

So in the provided examples, whenever ""walm"" is used, it continues the color mentioned directly before it until a new color word interrupts this pattern.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,128
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" is associated with a particular color each time it appears. Additionally, the color associated with ""lug"" is consistent across all examples. To find the rule, let's compare the appearances of “lug”:

1. lug -> blue (consistent in all examples)
2. dax -> green (consistent in all examples)
3. wif -> red (consistent in all examples)
4. zup -> yellow (consistent in all appearances)
5. bluf -> blue (but it appears only once)

Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" each time it's used, we can infer that ""lug"" means ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in every provided example.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we will analyze its occurrences and the corresponding outputs. Each word seems to have a color association:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- zup -> yellow

Now, let's observe the position of ""wif"" and what follows it:

1. lug wif dax -> blue red green
2. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
3. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
4. wif -> red
5. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue

The word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the word ""zup"" and the other words:

- Every time the word ""zup"" is present, the output always includes ""yellow"".
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green green green"".
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".
- The word ""wif"" results in ""red red"".
- The word ""walm"" results in an additional ""red"" or ""green"" depending on its position relative to the other words. If it follows ""dax"", the color is ""green""; if it follows ""wif"" or ""bluf"", the color is ""red"".

Given these observations, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be that it translates directly to ""yellow."" However, the meaning of the other words depends on the combinations provided and seems to be defined by the number of times a color is repeated and the sequential nature of how they are presented.

Rule:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green green green
- lug -> blue blue blue
- wif -> red red
- walm -> adds one more ""green"" if following ""dax"" or one more ""red"" if following ""wif"" or ""bluf""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the immediately preceding nonce word. 

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color indicated by the word preceding bluf.

For example:
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" translates to red, and ""bluf"" translates to repeating red, hence the output is ""red red.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to green, and ""bluf"" translates to repeating green, hence the output is ""green green.""
- In ""zup wif bluf,"" ""wif"" translates to red, and ""bluf"" translates to repeating red, hence the output is ""yellow red red.""
To determine the rule for ""walm"", let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs in each given example.

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Based on these examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" repeated the last color before it once or more times in the output. Here's how it works:

- In the first example, ""zup"" translates to yellow, followed by ""walm"", so the output should include the color of ""zup"" which is yellow, repeated three times before changing the color corresponding to ""wif"" which is red.

- In the second example, ""wif"" translates to red and is repeated three times thanks to ""walm"", before changing to the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.

- In the third example, it seems that ""walm"" repeated the sequence of colors that precede it twice (blue blue).

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" repeats the sequence green green (originally from ""lug wif dax"") twice before proceeding to the color for ""zup"", which is yellow.

- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

Rule: walm -> replicates the last color or sequence of colors mentioned before it in the output. The number of repetitions can be equal to the number of colors or elements in the phrase before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    ",Output: green red yellow red,green red yellow yellow,False,129
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green each time it is mentioned, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence. This is supported by the consistent output of ""green"" whenever ""dax"" appears in the input:

- Example 1: dax lug dax lug wif -> green blue green blue red
- Example 2: dax -> green
- Example 3: dax -> green
- Example 4: lug zup dax lug dax -> blue yellow green blue green
- Example 5: dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red

In every instance, ""dax"" is associated with the color green. Therefore, we can conclude the following:

dax -> green. Rule: ""dax"" represents the color green.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following outputs for the input words:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue
- lug -> red

Now, let's examine the instances of ""wif"":

- Input: wif dax bluf | Output: red green green
- Input: zup bluf wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow red red
- Input: zup dax zup wif | Output: yellow green yellow red
- Input: wif dax | Output: red green
- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif | Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Based on these examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the words around it. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow every time it appears in the input. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of other nonce words present:

- In the first input, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and since ""zup"" precedes it, we can infer ""zup"" means yellow.
- In the second input, ""walm"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Zup"" appears before both and once again corresponds to yellow.
- In the third input, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow.
- In the fourth input, ""zup"" appears after ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" and retains its meaning of yellow.
- In the last input, ""zup"" appears alone and has the output of yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the inputs and corresponding outputs systematically:

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

This output suggests that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the output ""red,"" while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Here, both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow.""

Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue

In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""blue.""

Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red

""Zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow"" again, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as it did in previous examples.

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

""wif"" and ""bluf"" produce ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is consistent with previous examples.

Based on these examples, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" matches the color associated with the immediately preceding word. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" and when it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" In the case where ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which precedes ""bluf"" for the first time in the fourth example, it outputs the same color as ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word that precedes it.
Based on the given examples, it seems that 'walm' dictates the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it three times. The word before 'walm' in each input corresponds to a color in the output, and this color is then repeated three times whenever 'walm' appears. Here's the breakdown of how 'walm' functions in each example:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   - 'lug' corresponds to the color blue.
   - When 'walm' appears after 'wif', 'lug' is the most recent color word, so it outputs blue three times.

2. Input: zup walm wif
   - 'zup' corresponds to yellow.
   - After 'walm', 'zup' is the most recent color word, so it outputs yellow three times.

3. Input: dax walm lug
   - 'dax' corresponds to green.
   - After 'walm', 'dax' is the most recent color word, so it outputs green three times.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   - In this sequence, 'walm' comes after 'wif', with the most recent color being red.
   - Therefore, it outputs red three times.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   - In this sequence, 'walm' follows 'lug', which corresponds to blue.
   - Thus, it outputs blue three times.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word 'walm' is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: When 'walm' appears, output the color corresponding to the word before it three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue green,True,130
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in every provided example.
Based on the provided examples, it looks like each unique word in the input correlates with a specific color in the output. To determine the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we can identify when it appears in the inputs and what color corresponds to it in the outputs.

- In the first input-output pair, ""dax"" appears twice at the beginning and the end, and the color ""green"" is at the beginning and the end of the output.
- In the second input-output pair, ""dax"" appears third and is matched with the third color in the output, which is ""green.""
- In the third input-output pair, ""dax"" is the last word and corresponds to the last color in the output, which again is ""green.""
- In the fourth input-output pair, ""dax"" is second and matches with ""green"" which is the second color in the output.
- In the fifth input-output pair, ""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to ""green,"" which is the first color in the output.

Given this consistent pattern, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Reviewing the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue,"" where ""lug"" aligns with ""blue,"" ""bluf"" also aligns with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" aligns with ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""wif"" appears to denote ""red"" as well.
- In the third example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" further confirming ""wif"" and ""walm"" as ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow,"" indicating ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" remains ""blue,"" ""wif"" stands for ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- The fifth example, with just ""wif,"" having an output of ""red,"" consolidates the idea that ""wif"" consistently means ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" regardless of position or context within the input sequence. Every instance of the word ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the color word preceding it to repeat. The word before ""bluf"" is translated into its color, and then ""bluf"" repeats that same color. Here's the breakdown of the rule based on each example:

1. lug -> blue, wif -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" outputs blue.
2. lug -> blue, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" so ""bluf"" outputs blue, dax -> green, lug -> blue.
3. lug -> blue, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" so ""bluf"" outputs blue.
4. wif -> red, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" so ""bluf"" outputs red.
5. wif -> red, zup -> yellow, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" so ""bluf"" outputs yellow, lug -> blue, walm is not translated but seems to cause a repeat of the color before it, resulting in three blues at the end.

Rule: bluf -> the color word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to infer the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"" as it relates to the outputs given. Here's the analysis of each instance:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Analysis: The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"",  ""lug"" is not repeated so its meaning is unclear, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"". ""Walm"" seems to generate three repeats of the color before it.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Analysis: Similarly, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"". ""Walm"" here again generates three repeats of ""green"".

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Analysis: Here, ""walm"" appears after the repeated word ""zup"" and thus repeats ""yellow"" three times. This reaffirms the possible rule for ""walm"".

4. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   Analysis: ""Walm"" again repeats the color three times after both ""dax"" and ""wif"".

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   Analysis: ""Walm"" repeats ""green"" after ""dax"" and does not affect ""wif"" and ""zup"" that follow, as they correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"".

Based on the consistent pattern in these examples, we can induce that the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,131
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the word ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output:

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output: red red yellow red blue green
Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow green yellow green red red
Input: dax -> Output: green
Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
Input: dax -> Output: green

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

The pattern established in the examples demonstrates that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input consistently results in ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples where the word ""zup"" translates to a color, it is observed that every time ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is the color yellow.

Here is an analysis of each example:

- Input: zup | Output: yellow 
The input ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"".

- Input: lug walm zup walm | Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
The word ""zup"" occurs once and is followed by ""yellow"" occurring three times in the output, suggesting ""walm"" may also relate to yellow but it is not entirely clear from this single example.

- Input: dax zup wif | Output: green yellow red
The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here, as ""dax"" to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

- Input: wif zup | Output: red yellow
The word ""zup"" again directly translates to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".

- Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf | Output: red green yellow red green green
The word ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"", with ""wif"" and ""dax"" consistently translating to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively. The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" here as well.

Given the consistency across examples, the rule deduced is:

Rule: zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" means the color yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns surrounding its use in each input/output pair:

1. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif | Output: blue green green yellow blue red
3. Input: lug bluf zup lug | Output: blue blue yellow blue
4. Input: dax zup lug bluf | Output: green yellow blue blue
5. Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red

Looking at the inputs and outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" might always correspond to the color ""green"". No matter its position, ""bluf"" always results in the word ""green"" in the output:

- Inputs 1, 2, and 4 have ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"", and the output is ""green"" following another color.
- Input 3 has ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"", with no words in between, and the result is ""blue"" followed by ""green"".
- Input 5 has ""wif"" following ""bluf"", and the output is ""red"" after ""green"".

In all examples, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" or the words around it, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"". Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: bluf -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"".

Here are the breakdowns:

1. In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow. After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated before returning to ""lug"" which is blue. Hence, blue yellow yellow yellow blue.

2. In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue. After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice. Hence, blue blue blue.

3. In ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" to blue. After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice. Hence, green blue blue blue.

4. In ""dax lug walm zup wif"", following the same pattern, after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice before the sequence continues with the colors corresponding to ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red). Hence, green blue blue blue yellow red.

5. In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated twice. Hence, yellow yellow yellow.

Rule:

walm -> causes the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,132
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided:

- When the word ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output includes ""yellow"" before ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output includes ""blue"" before ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" with ""lug"" preceding it, the output sequence is ""blue green yellow red.""

It appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input. The presence of other words in the input seems to add additional colors to the output sequence, each correlated to a specific word. The example ""lug dax zup wif"" suggests that ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively, and these colors are ordered according to the sequence of the words in the input.

Rule: dax -> green. The word ""dax"" always translates to the color ""green,"" and its position in a list does not affect this translation. Other non-dax words within the list correspond to their own specific colors, which are added to the output sequence in the order of their appearance in the input.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in an input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that precedes it. 

- If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- If the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" starts the sequence or follows a word not specified in other rules, its meaning is unclear based on the given examples.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word immediately before it. However, there is not enough information to determine what ""bluf"" would mean if it followed ""zup"" or any other word not previously mentioned in context with ""bluf.""
Based on the given examples, it looks like ""walm"" results in a series of outputs that match the color associated with the word that precedes it. To illustrate:

- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the corresponding output is ""green green green,"" with ""green"" aligned to ""dax.""
- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output following ""walm"" is ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif,"" the word that follows ""zup"".
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red,"" with ""red"" aligned to ""wif.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" with ""blue"" aligned to ""lug.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" with ""blue"" aligned to ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be: ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Every example that includes ""lug"" consistently includes ""blue"" in the corresponding output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue
Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output: red red yellow red blue green
Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green

In every output, the word ""green"" occurs immediately after the nonce word ""dax"", regardless of the preceding color. This consistent correlation allows us to deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided where the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we must identify the pattern from the given examples. Let us analyze each case:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   - We see that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" at the beginning and the end of the sequence. 
   - The word ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
   - The word ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
   - The word ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and ""dax"" maps to ""green"" as before.
   - ""zup"" comes after ""wif"" and outputs ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""bluf"" maps to ""green,"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red"" as before.
   - ""zup"" comes after ""wif"" again and outputs ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red"" as before.
   - ""walm"" is new here, but by comparing it with the next example, we might be able to figure out its color.

5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" appears to map to ""yellow"" since it produces ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
   - ""lug"" is the last word and maps to ""blue.""

Given these examples, the word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the context. We don't have any case that shows ""zup"" mapping to anything different.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be a repeat of the color associated with the word preceding it. Here are the associations given in the examples:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Now, looking at the patterns:

- Input: ""wif bluf"" | Output: ""red red"" (bluf repeats the color of ""wif"")
- Input: ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" | Output: ""yellow green green yellow green"" (bluf repeats the color of ""dax"")
- Input: ""zup bluf lug"" | Output: ""yellow yellow blue"" (bluf repeats the color of ""zup"")
- Input: ""wif bluf dax"" | Output: ""red red green"" (bluf repeats the color of ""wif"")
- Input: ""wif dax zup bluf"" | Output: ""red green yellow yellow"" (bluf repeats the color of ""zup"")

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that comes immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the pattern of outputs corresponding to the presence of the word ""walm"" and the words preceding it.

Here are the observations:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and there is no other word between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" we can infer that ""walm"" correlates with repeating the color before it two more times, so we have a total of three ""yellow."" 

2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" Here, we can see that the pattern of colors before ""walm"" is ""red red green,"" and then ""green green"" is repeated after ""dax,"" implying ""walm"" might mean to repeat the last color before it two more times.

3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which further confirms that ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned before it two more times.

4. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red."" Here, ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and we again see the color ""red"" repeated two additional times after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is consistent across all examples. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a command to repeat the last mentioned color two more times in sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Given the examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's try to identify patterns or relations in the given examples.

1. In the first input, we have ""zup dax wif"" and the output is ""yellow green red."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" it appears ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. In the second input, ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green."" We already suspect ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" If ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" then ""dax"" still seems to correspond to ""green.""

3. In the third input, ""dax"" appears between ""walm"" and ""zup."" Since each appearance of ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color ""red"" repeated for each letter in ""walm,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" if ""dax"" is surrounded by these colors, ""dax"" could again be corresponding to ""green"" as it appears alone.

4. In the fourth input, ""dax"" appears at the end of the sequence, but we are not provided with an output for ""lug"" so we have to derive it from the examples. Since ""lug"" repeats twice and is associated with two ""blue"" in the output, and ""walm"" is associated with a similar pattern as ""lug,"" we can infer that ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue blue"" or that ""blue"" is repeated for each letter in ""lug."" Thus, ""dax"" must still correspond to ""green.""

5. In the fifth input, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and is followed by ""zup"" which we know translates to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" which we have not seen before, but the constant factor here is that ""dax"" has the color ""green"" following it just like in previous inputs.

Considering the examples, ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the context it appears in.

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the provided examples where the input includes the word ""wif"" and the output consistently correlates with the color ""red"", the rule that can be deduced is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds with the output ""yellow."" It doesn't matter where in the sequence ""zup"" appears; it is always translated to ""yellow."" Therefore, it appears that ""zup"" does not change meaning based on context or position and is directly translatable to a specific color.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" is a command that causes the output to repeat the color word that immediately follows it. Here's the pattern deduced from the given examples:

- In the first and last examples, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" which means ""bluf"" is causing the word ""blue"" to be repeated.
- The second example shows that when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and precedes ""zup"" (which we can deduce corresponds to ""yellow""), the output is the repeated color word that comes after ""bluf"" — hence ""blue blue"" after ""lug bluf"" and ""yellow yellow"" after ""zup bluf.""
- The third example again shows ""bluf"" following different colors (green from ""dax"" and red from ""wif"") and then repeating those colors in the output.
- The fourth example also shows ""bluf"" following ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and causing the word ""red"" to repeat.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows a color word, it causes that color word to be repeated in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" alters the subsequent output's pattern or color sequence. Here's the pattern that emerges from the given examples:

1. In the first example, the occurrence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color red which is the output for the word ""wif"" that appears right before ""walm"":
   - Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   - Output: green red red red blue yellow

2. The second example reinforces this rule because ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""wif"" is repeated after ""walm"":
   - Input: wif walm dax
   - Output: red red red green

3. The third example shows that ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is repeated after ""walm"":
   - Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   - Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""zup"" is repeated after ""walm"":
   - Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   - Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

5. The fifth example once again shows that ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""dax"" gets repeated after ""walm"":
   - Input: dax walm wif zup
   - Output: green green green red yellow

From these observations, we can define the rule for ""walm"" as follows:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat for the number of times ""walm"" appears.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. The nonce word ""walm"" signifies repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,135
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Thus, the rule deduced is that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in a sequence or the other words present. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever 'wif' appears in the input, the word 'red' appears in the output.
- The word 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' in the output.
- The word 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' in the output.
- 'walm' is not present in any other example but when it appears with 'wif', the output is 'yellow red red red blue', indicating that it might correspond to the consecutive 'red' entries in the output.

Combining these observations, we can determine the most likely rule for the nonce word 'wif':

Rule: 'wif' -> 'red' 

This means that 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs, regardless of its position or the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that is next indicated by the following word. Here is the rule induction based on each example:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". The word following ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"". The word ""bluf"" caused ""red"" to be repeated twice more for a total of three times.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow"". The word following ""bluf"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" caused ""blue"" to be repeated, but here only once.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green"". The word following ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"". The word ""bluf"" caused ""red"" to be repeated, but here only once.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue"". The word following ""bluf"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" caused ""blue"" to be repeated, but here only once.
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". The word following ""bluf"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"". The word ""bluf"" caused ""green"" to be repeated, but here only once.

The rule seems to vary in how many times the following color is repeated, between once and twice. However, since there is not enough information to deduce a pattern about the number of repetitions, we can only say for certain that ""bluf"" indicates repetition of the subsequent color at least once.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color word to be repeated at least once in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

- ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it multiple times.

Let's break down the examples to see how this rule applies:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - Following ""wif"", ""walm"" causes the output to be ""red"" repeated three times.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - Following ""zup"", ""walm"" causes the output to be ""yellow"" repeated three times.

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - Following ""lug"", ""walm"" causes the output to be ""blue"" repeated three times.

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - Following ""wif"", ""walm"" causes the output to be ""red"" repeated three times.

5. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - Following ""zup"", ""walm"" causes the output to be ""yellow"" repeated three times.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green and is followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

So, the rule is:
- ""walm"" -> repeats the color of the preceding word in the output three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it takes the color associated with the word immediately before it and repeats that color three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,136
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's look at each pair of input and output to identify any patterns.

Input: dax lug zup dax
Output: green blue yellow green
- We see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""lug"" is new and appears in between ""dax"" and ""zup,"" corresponding to ""blue.""

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green
- ""Dax"" is ""green"" again. ""Lug"" is first and is ""blue.""

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""Zup"" is ""yellow"" again, and ""lug"" is at the end being ""blue.""

Input: zup lug 
Output: yellow blue
- ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and following it, ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- ""Lug"" appears first and is ""blue""; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" consistently, ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" to ""green"". The new word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Looking at these examples, it seems clear that ""lug"" is consistently translated as ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" in relation to the other words and the corresponding output colors.

Here is the analysis of the examples:

1. Input: dax lug → Output: green blue
   From this input-output pair, we can see that ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" ""Dax"" is translated as ""green.""

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax → Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Here ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the end. At both times, it corresponds to ""green."" It seems ""dax"" translates to ""green"" irrespective of its position.

3. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup → Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   ""Dax"" is found in the middle and towards the end before ""zup."" In both instances, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

4. Input: lug dax → Output: blue green
   When ""lug"" precedes ""dax,"" as in the first example, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: dax lug wif → Output: green blue red
   Even with the addition of ""wif"" after ""lug,"" ""dax"" continues to mean ""green.""

Based on the evidence, the rule appears to be consistent: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context in which it appears.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> the color that corresponds to the previously mentioned color noun or adjective.

Rule: When bluf follows a color-indicating word, it takes on the meaning of that color. If the color-indicating word is ""dax,"" the color is ""green."" When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" When ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" Same for ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when it precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs in each given example.

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
Looking at the pattern, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" However, after ""zup walm,"" we see a repetition of ""yellow."" Moreover, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and is followed by ""blue.""

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
In this example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), but the output has ""blue"" before it, thus ""walm"" might correspond to a repetition of the previous color, which is ""blue.""

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated. It further supports the idea that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the previous color.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), and the output is a repetition of ""green."" 

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
In this sequence, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which precedes a repetition of ""blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated.

Applying this rule:

walm -> When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the preceding color to be repeated in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,137
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs given.

1. Input: wif lug dax
   Output: red blue green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" must correspond to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" here corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - The second ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue""

3. Input: dax lug dax lug wif
   Output: green blue green blue red
   - The pattern for ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" from previous examples holds true here as well.

4. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   - The inconsistency here is with ""bluf,"" which previously corresponded to ""yellow,"" but now corresponds to ""red."" However, ""bluf"" is not the focus here—rather, it's the consistency of ""lug"" with ""blue.""

5. Input: wif dax lug dax
   Output: red green blue green
   - Again, the correspondence of ""dax"" and ""wif"" with ""green"" and ""red"" respectively remains, with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""

Based on the examples, the rule is consistent: every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Hence, the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position or the context in which it appears. 

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Meaning: ""dax"" means ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a rule for the nonce word ""wif."" Let's examine the pattern it presents:

Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and we can infer ""walm"" incorporates additional ""red.""

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Here, ""wif"" is at the end following ""zup,"" and it still corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif -> Output: red
Standing alone, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems to add another ""red.""

From these examples, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule we can determine is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" If ""zup"" is followed by another word that represents a color, ""zup"" takes on the meaning of ""yellow"" and the following word is translated to the corresponding color in the output (lug -> blue, bluf -> yellow, wif -> red). If ""zup"" is not followed by another word, the output is solely ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the output corresponding to the input in each example. 

1. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green yellow red green green."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The sequence ""wif dax"" repeats with ""red green,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which leads to the color ""green"" repeating.

2. ""wif zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red yellow green green."" Again, our three known words correspond to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively, and following ""dax"" is the word ""bluf,"" which again results in a repeated color, ""green.""

3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" corresponds to ""red red blue yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the color ""red"" is repeated immediately after. ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

4. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""red"" is repeated.

5. ""dax zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and the color is repeated.

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the previous color mentioned. Hence, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" causes the last color to be repeated in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the previous color mentioned.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we need to look at the relation between the input and the output in each example.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup"", and the corresponding output colors for ""dax"" and ""zup"" are ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively. For each occurrence of ""walm"" the color repeats thrice.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Here ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the corresponding output for ""wif"" is red, which again is repeated thrice after ""walm.""

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the corresponding output for ""lug"" is blue, which repeats after ""walm.""

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the associated output is red. ""Walm"" here also appears before ""dax,"" and it does not seem to affect the output for ""dax,"" which is green.

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Here ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and as before, the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated after ""walm.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to be repeated three times. Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" translates to ""repeat the previous color three times"". 

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax
    ",Output: red yellow green,red yellow green,True,138
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be consistent:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: lug wif lug wif lug -> Output: blue red blue red blue
Input: lug -> Output: blue
Input: zup lug zup dax -> Output: yellow blue yellow green
Input: lug wif zup wif -> Output: blue red yellow red

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.
dax -> green. Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, each unique word seems to correspond to a specific color. By comparing examples, we can find which word refers to which color:

- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the fourth input, where ""wif"" also appears and the output is ""blue red red.""
- ""wif"" when it appears on its own results in ""red,"" and when it appears with other words, it also translates to ""red"" in the output.

Assuming ""bluf"" possibly was used unintentionally in the fourth example and it should have been ""wif bluf"" to be consistent with the rest of the data, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color.

Let's summarize the examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
2. dax zup lug -> green yellow blue
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. lug dax zup -> blue green yellow
5. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Let’s look at each term's meaning when it's not followed by ""zup"":

- dax -> green (examples 2, 4, and 5)
- wif -> red (example 5)
- lug -> blue (example 4)

By examining the pattern when ""zup"" is used, we can see that it always corresponds to the color ""yellow"":

- zup dax wif -> yellow green red
- dax zup lug -> green yellow blue
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- lug dax zup -> blue green yellow

In each case, regardless of its position, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". So, using that pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is the last in the sequence of colors associated with the word before it.

Examples and Analysis:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   Analysis: The color associated with ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" following ""wif"" translates to red again. The word ""dax"" then translates to green.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Analysis: The color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" following ""zup"" translates to yellow again.

3. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red
   Analysis: The color associated with ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" following ""dax"" translates to green again. The word ""lug"" then translates to blue, and ""wif"" to red.

4. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   Analysis: The color associated with ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which means it translates to green again.

Therefore:
bluf -> The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm.""

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

We have the following associations:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

The word ""walm"" modifies each of the outputs in such a way that when it follows a word, it results in a repetition of that word's associated color three times (except when followed by another word, in which case the repetition is disrupted by the next word's associated color).

For example, after ""wif"" (which is ""red"") we get ""red red red"" when followed by ""walm."" Similarly, after ""dax"" (which is ""green"") we get ""green green green"" when followed by ""walm.""

Using the examples to derive the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word it follows to repeat three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Rule: When used after a word, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif dax
    ",Output: red green red green,red green red green,True,139
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""lug.""

In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with the word ""blue"":
Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

In the second example, ""lug"" appears first and is again translated to ""blue"":
Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red

The third example shows that ""lug"" followed by ""wif"" results in ""blue red"":
Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green blue red

The fourth example demonstrates ""lug"" being repeated and each instance of ""lug"" becoming ""blue"":
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue green blue red blue blue

In the fifth example, ""lug"" bookends ""zup"" and both instances are ""blue"" again:
Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be fairly straightforward:

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the series of nonce words. Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" is ""blue.""

lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in its uses across the examples. Let's examine where ""dax"" is used and what color corresponds to it in the output.

1. Input: dax wif lug dax
   Output: green red blue green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both at the beginning and the end of the sequence.

2. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Here, ""dax"" is situated between ""wif"" and ""walm,"" and it corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: dax lug dax
   Output: green blue green
   Again, ""dax"" at the beginning and end corresponds with ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug zup dax
   Output: green blue yellow green
   Both instances of ""dax"" translate to ""green.""

5. Input: lug dax zup dax wif
   Output: blue green yellow green red
   ""dax"" is in the middle and corresponds to ""green"" in both instances.

Based on these examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples. Irrespective of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, it consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" as follows:

In the first example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Since ""zup"" is consistently translated as ""yellow"" and ""wif"" as ""red"" in other examples as well, it can be inferred that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the second example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" must correspond to ""yellow"" as it is the only word not accounted for, and the only color in the output not yet associated with a word is ""yellow.""

In the third example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" As ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" must once again correspond to ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" translates to ""green green red blue yellow"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the output has ""green"" following another ""green,"" ""bluf"" must correspond to ""green.""

In the fifth example, ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red.” Here, ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Bluf"" must correspond to ""green"" as it comes right after ""dax"" and is followed by ""green"" in the output.

From these deductions, it can be surmised that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it represents the color immediately preceding it in the series, so ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

In the first example, ""lug dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green green red."" Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" following it results in two additional ""green""s.

In the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in two more ""green""s.

The third example, ""zup walm wif,"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" following it results again in two additional ""yellow""s.

In the fourth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" we have ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" Here ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" from ""zup"" two more times, in the sequence.

In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" after ""zup"" again results in two additional ""yellow""s.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the previous word two additional times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,140
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the patterns where ""dax"" appears and consider the output:

1. Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, ""green"" appears in the output.
2. Position of ""green"" in the output corresponds with the position of ""dax"" in the input.
3. No other words consistently result in the output of ""green"" besides ""dax.""

Based on these observations, we can conclude the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red.' There is no example in which 'wif' corresponds to anything other than 'red,' regardless of its position in the input string. The other words 'zup,' 'lug,' 'bluf,' and 'walm' correspond to 'yellow,' 'blue,' 'blue,' and 'red' respectively. Since 'walm' also translates to 'red,' it's important to note that the position does not alter the color translation for 'wif,' confirming that 'wif' specifically translates to 'red' in all cases presented.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Each instance of a nonce word in the input is translated directly to its color equivalent in the output, maintaining the order in which they appear. Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word zup is identified by its consistent translation to the color yellow in each example.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare each input's bluf placement with the corresponding part of the output:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

   After each ""zup lug"" pair, the output is ""yellow blue."" The final ""zup bluf"" ends with two yellows. The ""bluf"" seems to translate to an additional ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

   In this example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" identical to ""wif,"" but there is also an additional red. So, the presence of ""bluf"" does not depend on the word that precedes it.

3. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

   ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" producing an additional ""blue,"" and it follows ""zup,"" producing an additional ""yellow."" The term ""bluf"" matches the color of the word before it and repeats it.

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

   Here, ""wif"" produces a ""red,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which again produces a ""red.""

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

   Similar to the above examples, ""bluf"" again doubles the previous color, which in this case is ""red.""

Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. We deduce this through the following observations:

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", indicating that ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif"" which is red and repeats it thrice.
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" mimics the color of ""lug"" which is blue, repeating it three times.
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"", where ""walm"" again follows the pattern of repeating the color of the preceding word, ""wif"" (red), three times before the sequence continues with ""dax"" and ""zup"" which corresponds to green and yellow.
4. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", showing that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) thrice.
5. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" gives ""green blue green blue blue blue"", where ""walm"" takes the color of the word right before it, ""lug"" (blue), and repeats that color three times to match the pattern.

From these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color represented by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,141
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" appears to consistently correspond with the color ""green"" in the outputs. Let's review the examples to corroborate this:

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
(wif -> red, bluf -> red, dax -> green)

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue
(dax -> green, bluf -> green, wif -> red, lug -> blue)

In this example, ""bluf"" seems to correlate with ""green"" as well. However, in the first and third examples, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red."" This discrepancy indicates that ""dax"" uniquely corresponds with ""green,"" whereas ""bluf"" likely changes based on position or other contextual factors.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
(zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, walm -> yellow, dax -> green, wif -> red, bluf -> red)

This example further supports the hypothesis that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
(wif -> red, dax -> green)

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green
(zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, dax -> green)

Again, ""dax"" clearly corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green

This rule appears to hold true regardless of the word's position or the context within the input examples.
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. Whenever zup appears in the input, it corresponds to the color yellow in the output. The output does not vary with context when zup is used; it consistently translates to the color yellow regardless of the surrounding words. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can deduce a possible meaning for the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and results in ""red yellow.""

2. zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
   ""bluf"" appears twice. After ""zup"" it results in ""yellow red,"" and when followed by ""wif,"" it results in ""red.""

3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax."" Before ""bluf"" we see ""wif"" and it results in ""red red.""

4. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and results in ""green red.""

5. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
   ""bluf"" is at the end after ""lug"" and results in ""blue blue.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" does not directly correlate to a specific color. Instead, it seems to take on a value dependent on its position and surrounding words. However, without a clear pattern for how ""bluf"" affects the output or what determines its resulting color, we cannot decisively conclude a rule based on the information given.

To synthesize a tentative rule, I notice that ""bluf"" often results in ""red,"" but not consistently. This inconsistency could be due to various factors which are not explicitly clear from the given examples. Therefore, a direct rule for what ""bluf"" might mean or signify cannot be established without additional context or a larger set of examples.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent and cannot be conclusively determined from the provided examples. It does not consistently correspond to a specific color in the output but seems to vary based on its position and the words around it. More data is needed to ascertain a definitive rule for ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color that the word before ""walm"" represents three times. We can verify this rule by looking at the examples in detail:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug,"" therefore, appears to represent the color blue, and since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in three blue outputs.
- In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"". Both instances of ""wif walm"" lead to repeating ""red"" three times, indicating that ""wif"" represents red and ""walm"" makes it repeat thrice.
- The third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"", translates to ""red red green green green"". Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to ""green"" being repeated three times, suggesting that ""dax"" represents green and ""walm"" causes the repetition.
- The fourth example, ""lug walm zup wif"", translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red"". Again, ""lug walm"" results in three ""blue"" outputs, supporting the rule.
- Finally, the fifth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"", translates to ""green green green red red"". The ""dax walm"" leads to the output ""green"" repeated thrice, while the following ""wif bluf"" sequence changes the colors, further supporting that ""walm"" by itself causes the repetition of the previous color.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color represented by the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True,142
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""lug"" is always translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax."" Let's compare the input with the corresponding output for each example:

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   
2. Input: dax
   Output: green
   
3. Input: zup lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow red green

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

5. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

In each of the examples where the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green."" This is consistent across all examples, regardless of the words that appear before or after ""dax."" Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: 'wif' translates to the color 'red'.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. Here are the patterns that lead to this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" comes right after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" (""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").
- In the second and third examples, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output includes an extra ""green"" (""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"").
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" again follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" leading to ""green green"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be written as:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before bluf.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the occurrence of the word and the corresponding outputs.

1. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red.""
2. ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue.""
3. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green.""
4. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue.""
5. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""

Looking at the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" and we get two sets of three colors: ""blue"" and ""red."" In all examples, ""walm"" is the last input before a color is repeated three times, and the color that is repeated is the one that corresponds to the word right before ""walm."" For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and right after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow,green yellow yellow yellow,True,143
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"". Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"".
From the provided examples, we can infer a pattern that defines the meaning or the rule associated with the word ""dax."" 

Let's analyze:

1. When ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" or ""lug,"" it corresponds to ""green.""
2. In a sequence where ""dax"" is not following a specific word, it still corresponds to ""green.""
3. ""dax"" seems to be independent of the context that comes after it, as it remains ""green"" regardless of the following words.

Therefore, looking at all the provided examples where ""dax"" appears, it consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the context around it. Hence the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to imply the output ""red"" whenever it appears.

Input: wif lug dax -> Output: red blue green
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red""

Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

Input: wif -> Output: red
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

The occurence of ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. With the information given, one deduces this rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue

However, ""bluf"" and ""zup"" both translate to ""yellow,"" which might suggest there is no distinction between these two nonce words in terms of their color output or there is no additional context given to differentiate them. It's possible that ""bluf"" could be a distractor or have some other contextual significance not evident in the examples.

Given just the information above, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word immediately preceding it. The following breakdown shows how ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which maps to ""blue"". Hence, ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" which is ""blue"", making ""bluf"" also ""blue"".
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" again follows the pattern where it takes the color of the preceding word, which is ""dax"" mapping to ""green"" in both cases.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is after ""wif"", which is ""red"", and so ""bluf"" becomes ""red"".

So the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: The same color as the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a triple repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it. Observing the patterns:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" - repeated three times.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" includes ""green blue blue blue"" after ""dax lug"" and before ""zup"" (green and yellow respectively).
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" has ""blue blue blue"" between ""lug"" and ""zup"" (blue and yellow respectively), and later we see ""lug zup wif"" corresponding to ""blue yellow red"".
- ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red,"" where ""wif"" is followed by a triple red.
- ""wif walm"" gives us ""red red red,"" confirming that “wif” leads to red being said three times.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue"" in the output. Every instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" appears to translate to the color ""green"". Every time the word ""dax"" is encountered in the input, the color ""green"" is produced in the corresponding position in the output. However, note that there may be additional rules governing the translations of the other nonce words.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates directly to the color 'yellow' without dependency on the context in which it appears.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the color word preceding it. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green
Rule application: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word right before it, so ""dax bluf"" means ""green green"".

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Rule application: ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"", which means green.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
Rule application: ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"", which means red.

Input: dax lug bluf
Output: green blue blue
Rule application: ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"", which means blue.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Rule application: ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"", which means yellow.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word just before it.
To discover the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in the provided examples. Let’s analyze the output colors relative to the position of ""walm"" and its surrounding words.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   
2. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   
3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
4. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   
5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can deduce the following color associations for single words:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Now let’s look specifically at the outputs whenever ""walm"" appears:

- In every example, the word ""walm"" generates an output where the color of the word that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times. For example, in the first input, ""dax"" is green, so the output for ""dax walm"" is green repeated three times.
- The color that follows ""walm"" is not consistent and depends on the following word. Hence, ""walm"" doesn’t appear to affect the color that comes after it.

Based on this analysis:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,145
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following about the nonce word ""lug"":

Input: lug 
Output: blue 

Input: lug 
Output: blue 

Input: dax lug dax wif dax 
Output: green blue green red green 

Input: lug 
Output: blue 

Input: dax lug 
Output: green blue 

In all instances where ""lug"" appears as an input, the output is consistently ""blue"". This indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". There is no variation in the output in relation to the context in which ""lug"" is presented, which suggests that ""lug"" does not depend on surrounding words or order within the sequence to convey its meaning.

Rule: lug -> blue
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the correspondence between the inputs and outputs given in the examples:

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red

Input: wif dax wif lug wif
Output: red green red blue red

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

From these examples, it can be seen that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string. Thus, ""dax"" does not seem to have a positional or contextual contribution to the output other than being directly translated to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words. Each other word in the sequence corresponds to a unique color: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""dax"" corresponds to green; ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following mappings for the words used, including the nonce word ""zup"":

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow

However, noting that bluf also maps to yellow, we may assume that bluf and zup may be interchangeable or contextually dependent on one another. Walm does not have an independent mapping but is associated with zup to yield the output ""yellow."" This pattern indicates that ""walm"" may not affect the translation directly.

Based on these mappings, the rule appears to be the direct translation of words to colors, where ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to cause the preceding word to be repeated in the form of a specific color. Each unique word preceding ""bluf"" is associated with a color, as seen in the examples:

- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" so ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green,"" so ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""zup bluf"" in the context of ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue,"" so ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a command to translate the preceding word into its associated color and then repeat that color.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine its usage in various contexts:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
4. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
5. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue

From the above examples, we can see that ""walm"" is followed by repetition of preceding colors:

1. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" we see ""blue blue blue"".
2. ""zup"" presumably corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue; after ""walm"" we see a repetition of blue (corresponding to ""lug"" which comes just before ""walm"").
4. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red; after ""walm"" the red color is repeated three times.
5. Both ""dax"" and ""lug"" stand for colors, but only ""lug"" (blue) is repeated after ""walm"".

We can deduce that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Since the number of repetitions and which color gets repeated varies (sometimes the color that has a more frequent occurrence is not repeated), it's challenging to ascertain an exact pattern. However, the most consistent observation is that ""walm"" causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated. The number of repetitions seems inconsistent and might be related to the positions of the color words or other factors not explicitly obvious in the data provided.

Rule: Walm -> causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated an uncertain number of times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    ",Output: red yellow yellow,red yellow yellow,True,146
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue.

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" from the examples provided, we must look for patterns that correlate with the output colors. Here's the breakdown of each input and the respective output:

1. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
2. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
3. wif dax -> red green
4. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
5. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green

First, let's identify any patterns with common words:

- Every time ""dax"" appears first in the string, the first color in the output is green.
- Every instance of ""wif"" after the first word results in red.
- The color blue seems to be associated with the word ""lug"".
- Green is tied to ""dax"" unless it is preceded by ""wif"".

Now let's examine the color pattern associated specifically with ""dax"":

- When ""dax"" is the first word, the output color is green.
- When ""dax"" is used after ""wif"", the color immediately following is green.
- When ""dax"" is used as the last word after ""wif"", the color immediately preceding ""dax"" is red.

The rules for ""dax"" seem to be:

- ""dax"" at the beginning of a sequence correlates with the color green.
- ""dax"" immediately following ""wif"" correlates with the color green.
- ""dax"" at the end of the sequence doesn't necessarily correlate with the color green if another rule takes precedence (such as ""wif"" before it resulting in red).

Let's see if these patterns hold up:

Example 1: ""dax"" is at the start and end of the sequence. Both instances cause the color green, except for the ""dax"" following a ""wif"", which doesn't impact the ""dax"" being green.
Example 2: ""dax"" at the start equals green, ""wif"" results in red afterwards.
Example 4: ""dax"" leads to green, and the ""wif"" at the end makes it red.
Example 5: ""wif"" before ""dax"" doesn't stop ""dax"" from being green.

Given all of these observations, it seems that the rule for ""dax"" might be:

Rule: ""dax"" generally correlates with the color green, except if ""wif"" precedes it immediately.

However, this rule is not perfectly consistent since the output for ""wif dax"" is red green instead of just green. There could be an additional overarching rule that affects ""dax"" in relation to ""wif"" or other words. With the given information, the most consistent determination is:

Rule: ""dax"" correlates with the color green except when preceded by ""wif"", where ""wif"" takes precedence and correlates with red.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" does not change meaning dependent on the context, as it remains constant in all input examples. It appears before any other word in the input, suggesting that it could serve as an initial trigger for the subsequent color-naming rule. Moreover, ""wif"" itself corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output since ""red"" is the first color mentioned in each sequence, aligning with the ""wif"" being the first word in each input.

The subsequent words seem to determine the other colors. For instance, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""red,"" then a ""green"" when ""dax"" follows.

Rule: wif corresponds to the color ""red"" and signals the start of the color-naming sequence in the output. It translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the following words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should analyze its context within each of the examples provided and see how it correlates with the output.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, we can notice that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is also ""red.""

- In the second example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" From this, we can deduce that ""bluf"" in the context of just ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" again translates to ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Here, ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

By comparing the inputs with their outputs, we can come up with a potential rule for ""bluf"":

When ""bluf"" appears directly after another word, it takes the same color as the word before it.

To validate this, we check each input and output to see if this rule applies:

- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which matches the rule.
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" which also matches the rule.
- ""lug bluf"" isn't directly given, but from ""lug bluf wif"" translating to ""blue blue red,"" we can still infer that ""bluf"" mirrors ""lug"" and results in ""blue.""
- In the context where ""bluf"" does not follow a word, such as standalone ""bluf"" or at the beginning of the sequence, this rule cannot be applied due to a lack of such examples.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes the same color as the word before it.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" is related to color repetition and possibly to the word that precedes it. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - Here, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"". After ""walm"", the color green is repeated three times.
   - ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm"", and following that ""walm"", the color is repeated thrice, implying that ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" is ""blue"" and it does not have ""walm"" after it, hence it's represented only once.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" is ""red"" and appears twice, despite having no ""walm"" behind it.
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times.
   - ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" makes ""red"" appear three times.

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""zup"" starts with ""yellow"", but no repetition follows as there's no ""walm"".
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated thrice.
   - ""wif"" and ""dax"" stand alone so each is represented once.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following general rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be output three times.

Hence, the meaning of ""walm"" is a rule of repetition:
walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True,147
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Explanation: In each example, every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. The correlation does not depend on the position of the word ""lug"" within the sequence or on the surrounding words.
Based on the examples provided:

- The output for ""dax"" alone is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm,"" or ""wif,"" the color ""green"" is always at the end of the sequence.
- The words preceding ""dax"" (e.g., ""lug"", ""walm"", ""wif"") seem to correspond to their own specific colors, which repeat for the number of times those words are present before ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" represents the color ""green"" and when it is used with other words, those words repeat their corresponding color followed by ""green"" for ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided:

Input: wif
Output: red
Rule: The word ""wif"" alone corresponds to the color ""red.""

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green
Rule: Each word corresponds to a color; ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
Rule: The word ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red."" The word ""walm"" seems to double the prior color, turning ""wif"" (red) into ""red red red"" and ""zup"" (yellow) into ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Input: zup lug wif
Output: yellow blue red
Rule: The word ""wif"" continues to correspond to ""red,"" while ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Rule: ""Wif"" remains ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf""—although not directly translated—seems to reinforce or double the preceding color, much like ""walm.""

Based on these examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" When isolating the pairs of inputs and outputs, ""bluf"" is always followed by the word ""yellow"" in the corresponding output. Here are the instances for clarity:

- wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
- dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
- wif bluf lug -> red red blue
- dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
- zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue

These examples show that independently of the position of ""bluf"" in the input list, its output is consistently ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern in each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - After ""walm"", the color sequence repeats two more times with ""blue"" and then follows the pattern established prior to ""walm"". 

2. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - The word ""walm"" appears twice in this sequence, and ""green"" is repeated twice before the first occurrence of ""walm."" After the first ""walm"", ""yellow"" repeats its pattern from where it appeared before ""walm"", and the same repetition occurs after the second ""walm.""

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""Walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and the output of ""blue"" is repeated after ""walm.""

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - The occurrence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""green"" following ""dax.""

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - The word ""lug"" gives the output ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the output is three times ""blue.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" induces a repetition in the output. Specifically, it seems to repeat the output color that directly precedes it three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the output color that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the following pattern can be deduced:

- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.

This leads to the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax
Output: green

It can be inferred that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

For the other words:

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red

Input: wif dax zup wif
Output: red green yellow red

It appears that ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". There is an inconsistency with the word ""lug"" since it only appears once, but it was translated to ""blue"" both times it was mentioned that may suggest a typo in the examples. Assuming ""lug"" and ""bluf"" both mean ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently. 

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of zup, let's look at its context in each example:

1. `dax zup walm wif walm` -> `green yellow yellow yellow red red red`
2. `dax zup wif zup` -> `green yellow red yellow`
3. `lug zup` -> `blue yellow`
4. `dax wif zup dax` -> `green red yellow green`
5. `dax zup wif` -> `green yellow red`

Analyzing the color patterns and word positions, we can create the following mappings:
- `dax` -> green
- `wif` -> red
- `walm` -> yellow
- `lug` -> blue

Since `zup` always translates to yellow regardless of its position or the surrounding words, we can conclude:

Rule: zup -> yellow
In each example, the word ""bluf"" results in the output word being the same color word as the preceding word.

Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow (bluf takes the color of zup, which is yellow)
Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue (bluf takes the color of wif, which is red)
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (bluf takes the color of wif, which is red)
Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow (bluf takes the color of wif, which is red)
Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow (bluf takes the color of dax, which is green)

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Bluf duplicates the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it.
Walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, we take the color that is associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" and repeat that color three times in the output. For instance, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times. Similarly, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" since ""wif"" is associated with red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
Rule: dax -> green

Each occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds directly with the word ""green"" in the outputs provided. Regardless of position in the sequence or neighboring words, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
Based on the given examples, we see that every instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Regardless of the surrounding words and their respective translations (e.g., ""dax"" -> ""green"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""bluf"" -> ""red""), ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the output by repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" When ""walm"" is not preceded by any word, it does not have any effect, as seen in the third and fourth examples. It's important to note that the color repetition includes the color associated with ""walm"" itself, meaning ""walm"" seems to take on the color value of the word before it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears plus one (for the ""walm"" itself).

To apply the rule to the given examples:

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
- ""dax"" is associated with green;
- ""walm"" makes the green repeat two more times (""walm"" itself is green + one additional green);
- ""wif"" is associated with red.

2. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
- ""dax"" is associated with green;
- ""walm"" makes the green repeat two more times (""walm"" itself is green + one additional green).

3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
- ""lug"" is associated with blue;
- ""walm"" makes the blue repeat two times (""walm"" itself is blue + one additional blue).

4. wif walm -> red red red
- ""wif"" is associated with red;
- ""walm"" makes the red repeat two times (""walm"" itself is red + one additional red).

5. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow;
- ""walm"" makes the yellow repeat two times (""walm"" itself is yellow + one additional yellow);
- ""lug"" is associated with blue;
- ""wif"" is associated with red;
- ""bluf"" is likely a typo for ""wif"" since the example sticking to the repetition rule implies that ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red"", suggesting ""bluf"" is equivalent to ""wif.""

From these examples, ""walm"" -> rule-based repetition of the preceding color value, including itself.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" across all examples.
dax -> meaning. Meaning is the color green.

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Each unique word before ""wif"" corresponds to a unique color.

Here are the observed mappings from the examples:

- ""wif"" is by itself -> output ""red""
- ""zup"" before ""wif"" -> output ""yellow red""
- ""dax"" before ""wif"" -> output ""green red""
- ""lug"" before ""wif"" -> output ""blue red""
- ""wif"" before ""zup"" -> output ""red yellow""
- ""wif"" before ""dax"" -> output ""red green""

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". When ""wif"" is accompanied by other words, each of these words also translate to a respective color, and the sequence of colors outputted corresponds to the order of the words. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The placement of ""wif"" within the sequence determines the placement of ""red"" within the output color sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" can be deduced to mean the color ""yellow."" Each time the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding place in the output. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" can be observed as follows:

- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" or ""lug"" and ""dax"", the color ""red"" does not appear immediately after, but ""blue"" does.
- When ""bluf"" appears without a specific preceding word (""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""dax""), the output is ""blue"" twice.

From this pattern, it seems that the word ""bluf"" might be directly translated or equated to the color ""blue,"" with an exception to the rule that when followed by ""wif,"" it turns into ""red.""

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> ""blue,"" except when preceded by ""wif,"" then it means ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's start by examining each example and looking for patterns.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

By examining the outputs where ""walm"" appears and the colors represented before and after, we can try to establish a relationship between ""walm"" and the colors. We can notice that every time ""walm"" appears, there are three identical colors that follow it. In the first input, it is followed by three reds, and in the last input, it is followed by three greens and then three blues. When there is a color mentioned directly before ""walm,"" that color is repeated three times right after ""walm.""

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of three of the same color that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm -> means repeat the immediately preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output contains the word ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Analyzing the given examples and their outputs, I will try to identify patterns that relate the use of the word ""wif"" with a particular color in the output sequence.

Let's examine each example closely:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm 
   Output: green green green red blue green green green 
   - After ""wif,"" the color ""red"" appears. 

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm 
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow 
   - ""Wif"" is at the beginning; the first color is ""red.""

3. Input: dax zup lug wif lug 
   Output: green yellow blue red blue 
   - ""Wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and the color ""red"" follows again.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm 
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue 
   - Each instance of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in the output, either immediately or as the next color.

5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif 
   Output: red green red red yellow red 
   - ""Wif"" consistently relates to the output ""red.""

From the above examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" is directly associated with ""red."" This association holds true regardless of its position in the sequence (beginning, middle, or end) and whether or not it directly precedes or follows another word. The rule seems consistent across all examples provided.

Rule: wif -> red
Upon examining the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule I can deduce from the examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine how it appears in different contexts within the input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup lug bluf - Output: yellow blue blue
2. Input: lug wif bluf - Output: red blue red
3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax - Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
4. Input: lug zup bluf dax - Output: blue yellow yellow green
5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm - Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Looking at Inputs 1 and 2, ""bluf"" is preceded by two different words (""lug"" and ""wif""), and in both cases, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the Output.

Input 3 has ""bluf"" preceded by ""wif,"" and it similarly results in ""blue"" in the Output. However, there are other color words next to ""bluf"" (like ""lug,"" which seems to correspond to ""blue""), which may be contributing additional ""blue"" outputs.

Input 4's ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax."" There's only one instance of ""blue"" in the Output, suggesting ""zup"" doesn't affect the color associated with ""bluf.""

Input 5 has ""bluf"" in-between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and in the Output, ""blue"" only appears once, following the ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""zup.""

Given these observations, it seems clear that regardless of the words that come before or after ""bluf,"" the associated Output color is ""blue."" Other words in the inputs determine the colors of their respective outputs, but ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule:
bluf -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs by comparing the sequences.

1. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif | Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
3. Input: zup wif walm lug | Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
5. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue

From the above examples, we notice the following:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the output one or more times.
- In the first and fifth examples, which are identical, ""walm"" is directly followed by three ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" and both ""lug"" and ""walm"" convert to ""blue"" in the output, suggesting that maybe ""walm"" has the same output as the word just before it.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" resulting in two occurrences of ""red"" after ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""wif,"" and one ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug wif,"" and the output corresponds with three ""yellow,"" which does not align with the previous observation as ""lug"" has consistently been ""blue"" and ""wif"" has been ""red.""

The fourth example breaks the pattern that was emerging from the other examples. If ""walm"" meant to replicate the color of the word immediately before it, then the output of the fourth example would include blue (for ""lug""), not three yellows.

Given the inconsistency and insufficient examples to identify a clear pattern related to the surrounding words or sequences, but consistent appearance of the color ""blue"" in the output, the simplest explanation is that ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" one or more times, based on the context which we cannot definitively determine from the given examples.

Rule: walm -> blue (repeated one or more times, exact repetition depends on context not provided in examples)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the input and output pairs provided, one can assemble the following mappings:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
- walm -> green

Taking into account these translations and examining where ""dax"" appears in the sequences, a pattern emerges: ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" unaffected by its position in the sequence.

So, the meaning of ""dax"" in this context can be defined as:

Rule: ""dax"" is equivalent to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the word 'wif' consistently results in the output 'red.' When 'wif' is combined with other words, such as 'lug' or 'bluf,' it seems to influence the output color associated with those words. Here is a possible induction of the rules based on the given examples:

1. 'wif' on its own results in the output 'red.'
2. 'wif' followed by 'lug' produces the output sequence 'red blue.'
3. 'wif' followed by 'bluf' results in 'red red.'
4. Multiple occurrences of 'wif' and 'bluf' within the input continue to produce the pattern where 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and 'bluf' corresponds to 'red,' but a new word 'zup' appears to correspond to 'yellow.'

From this, it seems that 'wif' can be understood as a command or operation that outputs 'red.' Additionally, when combined with certain words, it might be part of a pair that determines a specific sequence of colors.

Rule: 'wif' invariably results in the output 'red.' The presence and order of other words following 'wif' determine the sequence of additional output colors. 

wif -> 'red'
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we look for patterns in the provided examples. Each input and its respective output will be used to deduce the rule.

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" might mean ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" might also mean ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup lug dax
   Output: yellow blue green
   
   Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""dax,"" with the corresponding output ""yellow blue green."" Given that ""zup"" resulted in ""yellow"" in the first example, it's consistent here. We can tentatively assume that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""dax"" means ""green,"" based on their positions and outputs.

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
   In this example, ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" which precedes ""bluf."" The output is ""green yellow yellow."" This reaffirms that ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" ""zup"" continues to mean ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" likely means ""yellow"" as it did in the first example.

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   
   ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" with the output being three ""yellow""s followed by ""blue"" and ""red."" This reinforces the hypothesis that ""zup"" means ""yellow."" ""Lug"" has been associated with ""blue"" consistently. The occurrence of ""wif"" is new, and based on its position, it likely means ""red."" Since ""walm"" is between two occurrences of ""zup,"" and we see consecutive ""yellow""s in the output, ""walm"" might also mean ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug dax zup
   Output: blue green yellow
   
   This final example shows ""lug"" and ""dax"" preceding ""zup."" Given their outputs, ""blue"" and ""green"" are consistent with previous examples for ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and ""zup""'s position at the end correlating with ""yellow"" is consistent as well.

Based on all five examples, ""zup"" consistently correlates with ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" In every example, the output includes the color ""blue"" in the position corresponding to where ""bluf"" appears in the input. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", it is necessary to examine the correlation between the input and the output provided in the examples.

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

- In all the inputs containing the word ""walm"", the outputs consist of multiple instances of the same color followed directly by a color that is not repeated.
- ""Lug"" always corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"". When ""walm"" is in the input sequence, the output sequence that follows includes three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"".
- The color after the three repeated colors seems to correspond to the word that follows ""walm"". For example, ""wif"" after ""walm"" results in ""red"". If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or is not followed by another word associated with a color, then there is no color following the three repeated colors.
- There is an exception in the last input example where ""walm"" is at the end, and it still outputs three colors, which corresponds to ""dax"", indicating the rule holds even when ""walm"" is at the end.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat three times, followed by the color that corresponds to the word immediately following ""walm"", if there is one.

Therefore:

walm -> causes the output color of the preceding word to repeat three times, followed by the output color of the next word if available.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug walm
    ",Output: yellow blue blue blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue blue blue,False,153
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position:

- In the first example, ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green,"" where ""lug"" is the first word and ""blue"" is the first color.
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red blue,"" with ""lug"" as the last word and ""blue"" as the last color.
- In the third example, ""wif"" and ""zup"" seem to correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and this is consistent across all examples. Therefore, we can isolate the occurrence of ""lug"" and confirm that it translates to ""blue"" each time.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is on its own and the output is simply ""blue.""
- The fifth example also shows ""zup lug wif"" mapping to ""yellow blue red.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
From the given input and output pairs, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" by comparing the sequences and looking for consistent patterns related to ""wif"" that correlate with the given outputs.

In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" No other word in the sequences given seems to correlate with this color consistently. Thus, based on the provided data, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be directly linked to the color ""red.""

Other words in the examples like ""zup"", ""walm"", and ""dax"" also correlate with specific colors (""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""green"" respectively), since whenever they appear, the output consistently remains the same regardless of their position or the context in which they are used.

Here is the induction based on the examples provided:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used. Other words, such as ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf,"" seem to correspond to different colors.

Here is the list of translations based on the examples:

- walm -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue

Rule:
zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be the repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""bluf"".
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times. 

For instance, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" indicates that the color blue should be repeated three times. Similarly, ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red"", where ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the color green three times, and then ""wif"" changes the sequence to red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: green yellow green blue green,green yellow green blue green,True,154
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue' in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in the provided examples.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to observe its output when it appears in different contexts within the provided examples.

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" (repeated based on the duplication of ""walm""). Notably, after ""wif,"" ""walm"" changes its output from ""blue"" to ""red."" ""wif"" causes a duplication effect and changes the color of the following word to ""red.""

3. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""wif"" causes ""bluf"" to produce an output of ""red,"" which is not its inherent output because ""dax"" produces the output of ""green."" ""wif"" may have a color-changing and duplicating effect on the word that follows it.

4. Input: wif lug wif
   Output: red blue red
   - The first ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the second one appears to mirror this effect, although there is no word following the second ""wif"" to confirm the duplication or color-changing effect.

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - ""zup"" has already been established to mean ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" here corresponds to ""red."" There is no word after ""wif"" to observe additional effects.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule for ""wif"":

Rule: When ""wif"" appears, it outputs ""red."" Additionally, it has the potential to change the color output of the word that follows it to ""red"" and possibly duplicate the output depending on the context.

From the examples given, it cannot be conclusively determined whether ""wif"" always changes the output color of the following word or duplicates it due to limited context. However, we can conclusively state that:

wif -> ""red"" and potentially alters the output of the following word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the other words present.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to depend on another word present in the input. Specifically, ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. This can be deduced by observing that each instance of ""bluf"" is directly preceded by a word that has a corresponding color in the output, and ""bluf"" takes the color of that word:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" = green red red. Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, so ""bluf"" is red.

2. ""zup wif bluf"" = yellow red red. Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, so ""bluf"" is red.

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" = yellow yellow red red red. Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow.

4. ""lug bluf"" = blue blue. In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, so ""bluf"" is blue.

5. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" = red yellow yellow red green. In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, thus ""bluf"" is yellow.

To summarize, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> takes the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: If a word X precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" represents the color associated with word X. If word X is ""wif,"" ""bluf"" is red; if X is ""zup,"" ""bluf"" is yellow; if X is ""lug,"" ""bluf"" is blue; if X is ""dax,"" the color has not been explicitly identified in conjunction with ""bluf,"" but we can infer from other examples that ""dax"" is likely green (as seen in the last example: ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" matches to ""red yellow yellow red green"").
Observing the provided examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   
5. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

From the examples, the output color for ""walm"" always repeats the color of the word just before it. In example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" generates three reds. In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and produces three blues. In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and produces three greens. For the last two examples, we see the same pattern with ""walm"" following ""lug"" to produce blue (example 4) and following ""zup"" to produce yellow (example 5), both repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning: repeat the color of the word just before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,155
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the examples provided:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" does not seem dependent on its position in the input sequence since it results in ""green"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end.
- Other words seem to correspond to different colors: ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""wif"" -> ""red"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that each word in the input is mapped to a specific color in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can try to induce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif."" Let’s analyze each example step by step:

1. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
2. Input: zup dax lug wif dax
   Output: yellow green blue red green
3. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
4. Input: wif
   Output: red
5. Input: zup lug wif dax lug
   Output: yellow blue red green blue

Looking at these examples, it seems that each word in the input is translated to a specific color in the output. Also, ""wif"" appears in each input that has been translated into 'red' in the output.

Here is what we can deduce specific to the word ""wif"":

- ""wif"" by itself translates to 'red'
- ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" translates to 'red green'
- ""wif"" followed by ""zup"" translates to 'red yellow'

From the examples, it is consistent that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, 'red' appears in the same position in the output regardless of what follows ""wif.""

Hence, the rule we can deduce for ""wif"" is:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to 'red'.
Based on the examples given:

Input: zup wif lug wif
Output: yellow red blue red

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

We can observe that whenever ""zup"" appears as an input, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, we can deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", let's look for patterns and correlations between the input words and the output colors. We'll examine each case, focusing on the appearance of ""bluf"":

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""
   ""bluf"" first follows ""dax"" (green) and is associated with ""green"". Later, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow) and before ""lug"" (blue), and is associated with ""yellow"".

3. ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red""
   ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" (blue) and corresponds to ""blue"".

4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue""
   ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and corresponds again to ""green"".

5. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red""
   ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" (red) and corresponds to ""red"".

Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding it:

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

So if ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", which is ""green"", ""bluf"" here means ""green"". If ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"", which is blue, ""bluf"" means ""blue"", and so on.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in each input-output pair:

1. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" If we assume ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" based on the repetition, the word ""dax"" at the end seems to correspond to ""green,"" which is a different color from the previous words.

2. ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" This suggests that ""walm"" may take on the color of the word preceding it since it matches the color output for ""zup.""

3. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow."" This sequence suggests that ""dax"" is still ""green,"" but ""walm"" first adopts the color of ""dax"" (green) and then the color of ""wif"" (red), and finally, ""zup"" is yellow. It reinforces the idea that ""walm"" takes on the color attribute of the word before it.

4. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Since there are no other words for ""walm"" to take color from, and we haven't seen ""lug"" before, we might assume that ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" and that ""walm"" adopted the blue color from ""lug.""

5. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Once again, ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" and since we have established ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" adopts the color green as well.

Based on the patterns observed, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is to take on the color attribute of the word that precedes it. If ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to ""red,"" it takes on the red color, and so on for other colors.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,156
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we should look at the corresponding color in the output for each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input.

From the first input-output pair:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  
From the second input-output pair:

- Both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"" again.

From the third input-output pair:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

From the fourth input-output pair:

- ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue""

Lastly, from the fifth input-output pair:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Considering all instances, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of context. Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" can be concluded as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the following interpretations can be made:

1. When ""dax"" is said alone (Input: dax), the corresponding output is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is combined with another word, e.g., ""zup"" (Input: dax zup), ""green"" precedes the color that is associated with the other word. In the case of ""zup,"" that color is ""yellow.""
3. ""dax"" can be repeated within a sequence, and each occurrence translates to ""green"" (Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm; Output: green green green red blue green green green).

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". When used in a sequence, the term ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let us examine the input and output pairs closely.

- In the input ""wif lug"" the output is ""red blue."" Here, ""wif"" appears to correspond with ""red"" because ""lug"" could correspond with ""blue"" due to their respective positions.
- Looking at ""zup wif walm,"" with the output ""yellow red red red,"" it's clear that ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" and that ""wif"" again appears to correspond with ""red."" ""Walm,"" based on repetition in the output, seems to multiply the color associated with it by the number of letters it contains.
- The input ""wif"" with the output ""red"" confirms that ""wif"" consistently corresponds with ""red.""
- With the input ""wif zup"" resulting in ""red yellow,"" we again see that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" thus maintaining consistency.
- Finally, in ""wif bluf dax walm,"" with the output being ""red red green green green,"" it seems that ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" as well (since it has not been established by previous examples, we might assume it defaults to the color associated with ""wif""). ""Dax"" appears to translate to ""green,"" and ""walm,"" as discussed, seems to reproduce the color (in this case, ""green"") for each letter in the word.

From examining the patterns above, we can induce the rule that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position in the input or the context with other words.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each additional nonce word in the input after ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color based on the following mappings identified from the provided examples:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- walm -> red (note: ""walm"" appears to equate to multiple instances of the color ""red"" based on the third example where it is repeated three times, but there's ambiguity as ""walm"" in the fourth example translates to three instances of ""yellow""; this discrepancy could be due to the position of ""walm"" following ""zup"" directly in the fourth example)
- dax -> green

Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" in the context provided is consistently ""yellow,"" while additional nonce words following ""zup"" are translated into their color equivalents based on the patterns observed in the examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the given examples to look for a pattern. Let's start by associating each unique word in the input with its corresponding color in the output:

- ""wif"" seems to consistently result in the output ""red"".
- ""dax"" appears to correlate with ""green"".
- ""lug"" aligns with ""blue"" when it follows ""bluf"" but ""blue"" when it precedes it.
- The color ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup"" in the last example.
- The word ""bluf"" appears in every input, and based on the context, it has produced ""blue"" and ""red"" in the outputs. However, the color ""blue"" occurs when ""bluf"" is followed or preceded by ""lug,"" while ""red"" appears when ""wif"" follows ""bluf.""

By this examination, it's evident that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color output. Instead, its translation seems to change based on the words that come before or after it. The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" produces the output ""blue"" when it is next to ""lug,"" either before or after it. However, this rule is not clearly applicable when other words are involved, as it results in ""red"" when followed by ""wif"" but ""green"" when preceded by ""dax.""

Thus, the rule is not fully clear based on the given examples. The information suggests ""bluf"" may mean ""blue"" when near ""lug,"" but the other uses need more examples to form a consistent rule.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is immediately before or after ""lug,"" it means ""blue"". In other contexts, the meaning is not consistent and cannot be determined with the given information.
To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we can compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs across all examples to identify patterns.

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm  
   Output: red red green green green
   
2. Input: dax zup walm wif  
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   
3. Input: lug walm  
   Output: blue blue blue
   
4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif  
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   
5. Input: dax walm  
   Output: green green green

Let's go through the occurrences of the word ""walm"" and the outputs after it:

1. In the first example, after ""walm"", there are three ""green"" outputs.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" outputs and then one ""red"".
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by two more ""blue"" outputs.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""green"" outputs, one ""yellow"", and then one ""red"".
5. In the fifth example, after ""walm"", there are two ""green"" outputs.

It seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the last color output, and the number of repeated colors equals the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm"", except when ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" then a ""red"" is added at the end of the sequence. Looking at examples 1, 2, and 4, the ""wif"" follows ""walm"", resulting in an additional ""red"" output, which doesn't correspond with the ""walm"" rule.

Accordingly, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" means to repeat the last color that was outputted, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of letters in the word immediately before ""walm"". If the word ""wif"" follows ""walm"", append a ""red"" to the end of the generated sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue red red yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,False,157
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the examples provided, it seems like ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" each correspond to a color. Each instance of ""dax"" is translated as ""green."" No other context is given that alters the meaning of ""dax"" in different situations. It consistently translates to ""green"" irrespective of its position in a sequence. There is no evidence of it being dependent on context, as its meaning remains constant across all examples given.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the presence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Here is the breakdown:

1. zup dax wif zup -> yellow green red yellow (wif corresponds to red)
2. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red (wif is the last word and corresponds to red; all other words correspond to yellow)
3. zup wif -> yellow red (wif corresponds to red)
4. wif -> red (wif alone still corresponds to red)
5. wif -> red (repeated example confirming that wif corresponds to red)

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the following pattern can be observed:

- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow""
- The other words seem to correspond to different colors: 
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  
However, ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of position or surrounding words. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be inferred as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the rules underlying the problem and report on what ""bluf"" means, let's begin by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Now, looking at the input-output pairs, here is what we can notice:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears at the end of an input, the corresponding output repeats the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"".
   - In ""zup dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, thus ""bluf"" results in ""green green"".
   - In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, thus ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".

2. This rule also seems to hold true if other words are present before ""bluf"".
   - In ""wif lug zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and thus ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".

3. ""Bluf"" maintains this rule regardless of its position in respect to ""wif"".
   - Even when ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" multiple times, ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""red red"" every time.

4. Whether ""bluf"" appears alongside ""dax"" or not doesn't change the behavior of ""bluf"".
   - It still repeats the color of the word right before it, as seen in ""wif bluf dax"" leading to ""red red green"".

Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

bluf -> means to repeat the color of the word immediately before it, twice.

Rule: If ""x"" corresponds to a certain color, and it is immediately followed by ""bluf"", then the output will repeat the color associated with ""x"" two times.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at the patterns in input and output, focusing on the elements immediately before and after ""walm,"" as well as the colors in the output.

In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" This indicates that ""walm"" may contribute to a repetition of the color associated with the word before it:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
(Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we have three ""yellow."")

In the second and third examples, ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red"":

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Following this pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the previously mentioned color.

However, in the fourth example, the colors seem to line up directly with the previous words, except for ""walm,"" which results in ""blue blue,"" twice the repetition compared to ""lug"":

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
(Direct color association until ""walm,"" where ""blue"" is repeated additional times.)

In the fifth example, we have ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" where once again, the repetition occurs after ""walm"":

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In this case, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow,"" and the sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""walm,"" indicating repetition.

From the given data, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is the color associated with the immediately preceding word, repeated multiple times. The exact number of repetitions is not consistent across examples but often appears to be three or more times the preceding color for a single instance of ""walm."" 

Therefore:

walm -> Causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The number of repetitions may vary.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup wif
    ",Output: blue green yellow red,blue green yellow red,True,158
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all the provided examples.

Rule: lug consistently means blue regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each input-output pair and identify the pattern.

1. Input: dax zup wif -> Output: green yellow red
2. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
3. Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
4. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
5. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green

Analyzing the sequences, we notice that each time ""dax"" is mentioned, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Other words lead to different colors, but ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""

From this pattern, we can deduce that ""dax"" correlates with the color green in the outputs provided.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" appears to be the color red.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""yellow."" Additionally, it appears that ""zup"" may also have the rule of repeating the color that follows it, until a different color word, or a word with a spelled-out color translation, appears.

Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. ""lug wif zup wif walm""
   Translation: blue red yellow red red red
   Rule observed: ""zup"" translates to yellow and then repeats the following color word (""wif"" = red) until ""walm.""

2. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif""
   Translation: blue green yellow green green green red
   Rule observed: Here ""zup"" translates to yellow and repeats the color word after it (""dax"" = green) until a new color word or ""walm"" is reached.

3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm""
   Translation: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Rule observed: ""zup"" changes to yellow and then repeats ""bluf"" (translates to yellow) until a new color word or ""walm"" appears.

4. ""zup wif""
   Translation: yellow red
   Rule observed: ""zup"" means yellow, and after it, the color word ""wif"" (red) is not repeated since the sequence ends.

5. ""dax zup walm wif""
   Translation: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Rule observed: Here ""zup"" first translates to yellow and then repeats itself until ""walm"" signals a stop, followed by the next color word ""wif"" which is red.

Rule: zup -> yellow, and when followed by a color word, it causes a repetition of that color until a new color word or a stop signal (""walm"") appears.
Based on the given examples, each time the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, it corresponds to the color that the previous word represents. Here's the rule derived from the examples provided:

- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In ""dax zup wif bluf lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" follows with the same color ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" follows with ""red""; later ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and the following ""bluf"" is also ""blue"".
- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples:

- Whenever ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three reds followed by four yellows: ""wif walm"" -> red red red yellow yellow yellow yellow
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a yellow followed by three blues: ""zup lug walm"" -> yellow blue blue blue
- Similarly, when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a blue followed by three blues: ""wif lug walm"" -> red blue blue blue
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three greens: ""dax walm"" -> green green green (this is consistent in two examples)

Given the input and output patterns, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the preceding word three times. To express this rule for ""walm,"" we could say:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: If X is the color associated with the word preceding ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is X X X.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,159
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be relative to the position of the word ""dax"" in the sequence and the number of words in the input.

When ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. The position and number of occurrences of ""green"" in the output vary depending on the position of ""dax"" and the number of other words in the sequence. Here is what can be deduced from each example:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
   ""dax"" appears at the beginning and is followed by one other word ""bluf."" The output is ""green"" twice.

2. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
   ""dax"" appears at the end and is preceded by two words. ""Green"" appears once at the end of the output.

3. Input: dax -> Output: green
   ""dax"" is the only word in the input and leads to a single ""green"" in the output.

4. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
   ""dax"" appears at the beginning and is followed by one other word ""walm"". The output is ""green"" three times.

5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""dax"" appears in the middle of five words, and ""green"" appears once in the middle of the output, corresponding to the position of ""dax."" It is flanked by other colors which seem to follow a pattern based on the other words in the sequence that are not ""dax.""

From this, a rule can be deduced:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the word ""green"" in the output, and its position in the input sequence determines where ""green"" appears in the output. If ""dax"" is the only word or the first word in the sequence, it leads to repeated ""green"" in the output corresponding to the number of words following it plus one (or just one if ""dax"" is the only word). If ""dax"" is at the end or in the middle, ""green"" appears once in the corresponding position in the output.

Thus, we can conclude:

dax -> ""green"" (with respect to its position in the sequence)
wif -> meaning. Meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Analyzing the given examples:

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

From these examples, it looks like ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow.""

Therefore:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The presence of the word ""zup"" in the input correlates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the given examples and their corresponding outputs to detect patterns:

1. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   
2. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   
3. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   
4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   
5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

Seeing these examples, let's establish the initial mapping for the nonce words we can infer from consistent patterns:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Now, let's try to figure out what ""bluf"" means based on this mapping and the patterns that emerge as it is included within different inputs.

Looking at the first input-output pair, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is associated with ""red,"" and the output is two reds instead of one. Similarly, in the second output, two ""bluf""s follow a ""wif,"" producing two additional ""red"" in the output, doubling the number of expected ""red.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" sandwiched between ""zup"" and ""wif"" results in two yellows followed by a red, suggesting that ""bluf"" induces a duplication of the color that precedes it.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which is ""red"") and the output is again two reds.

In the last example where only ""dax"" and ""bluf"" are present, we have two occurrences of green, hinting that indeed ""bluf"" caused the duplication of the preceding color term.

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the color associated with the word prior to ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> causes duplication of the color indicated by the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each input and the corresponding output in sequence. We will look for a pattern in the transformations, considering the words before and after ""walm"" and their corresponding color translations.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

For each usage of ""walm,"" we can observe the following rules:

1. The output color red immediately follows the word ""walm"" in each example.
2. The word preceding ""walm"" does not have a consistent color in the output (lug -> blue, wif -> red, dax -> green), suggesting that ""walm"" does not translate to the same color as the preceding word.
3. The word that comes after ""walm"" does not correlate directly to red in other contexts, so ""walm"" isn't causing a color repeat of the subsequent word either.
4. The word ""walm"" itself consistently results in multiple reds being output in succession, indicating that ""walm"" likely corresponds to a repetitive function—specifically, a repetition of the color red.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" translates into a series of red outputs, specifically, three reds in a row. The instances following ""walm,"" such as lug or dax, resume their original color mappings after this series of reds.

Hence, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> a series of three red colors in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,160
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Evidence:
1. ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" and given that zup changes in color in other examples, we can deduce that lug is consistent and translates to blue.
2. ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" supporting that lug consistently means blue.
3. ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green,"" where lug is followed by dax, which consistently translates to green. Therefore, lug must mean blue.
4. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green blue,"" and given that the last word in each sequence corresponds with the last color—lug with blue.
5. ""wif lug wif"" translates to ""red blue red,"" and since wif translates to red both before and after lug, lug remains consistent as blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs. Let's analyze the information we have:

1. dax wif -> green red
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. lug dax -> blue green
4. wif lug dax -> red blue green
5. dax zup -> green yellow

From these examples, it appears that each word in the input maps to a specific color in the output and that ""dax"" consistently produces the color green in the output regardless of its position. Thus, we can propose the following rule:

dax -> green

Now we will format the answer as requested:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the word ""zup"" can be determined as follows:

In the first example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Since ""wif"" is the only word preceding the first occurrence of ""zup"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and then ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", the presence of ""wif"" does not affect the meaning of ""zup"".

In the second example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow red blue green"". ""Zup"" appears at the beginning and translates to ""yellow"", which remains consistent regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

In the third example, ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue"". Again, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", which is consistent with prior examples.

In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow"". Here, ""zup"" is at the end, after ""wif"", which translates to ""red"". Unlike in the first example, the position after ""wif"" does not affect the meaning of ""zup"", as ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow"".

In the last example, the single word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", which confirms that ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's look at the patterns in the given examples:

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

From the examples, we can observe that when the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, there seems to be a repeated color in the output corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and with ""bluf"" following it, the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows a ""lug,"" resulting in an additional ""blue"" in the output, following the pattern ""blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""

However, in the third example, we see ""wif"" translating to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is two ""red"" instead of one. This can be interpreted as ""bluf"" doubling the output of the word that comes before it.

Putting all the observations together, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word preceding it to be repeated once more in the output. If there are two different colors before ""bluf,"" as in the third example, ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be doubled.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""
From the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm."" Here is the rule I deducted:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue. After ""walm,"" there appears ""blue"" three times before the pattern changes due to the introduction of a new word ""wif,"" which corresponds to red. Then, ""lug"" appears again, giving us another ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" we have ""red"" repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" the pattern before ""walm"" is blue, green, blue, yellow. However, after ""walm,"" only ""yellow"" is repeated three times, and then ""lug"" makes it blue again.
- In the fourth example, it's clear that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times until ""wif"" corresponds to red, and then ""lug"" goes back to blue.

Given this, the rule is that ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times before continuing with the sequence determined by the input.

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue."" To confirm this, we can check if ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in every instance.

Input: dax wif lug
Output: green red blue

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow

In each of these examples, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the output color is ""blue."" There is a one-to-one correspondence between ""lug"" and the color blue across all examples, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input string or the other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" is used in the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we will look at the patterns in each example where the word appears and the corresponding output.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when followed by ""bluf"" which corresponds to another ""red"".

Input: lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it is between two ""lug"".

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"". ""Wif"" appears two times and corresponds to ""red"" both times, regardless of the surrounding words which are ""bluf"" and ""dax"" the first time, and ""dax"" and ""zup"" the second time.

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
- Once again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" sandwiched between ""bluf"" corresponding to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" to ""green"" in this scenario. ""Wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and precedes ""dax"".

From these observations, it is clear that ""wif"" directly corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context it's used in. Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the output when ""bluf"" is an input in comparison to other words to see if a pattern emerges.

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue."" 
2. When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
3. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where it can be noted ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and yields ""blue blue.""
4. ""lug bluf wif"" gives us ""blue blue red.""
5. ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" provides ""yellow red red yellow blue,"" with ""bluf"" following ""wif"" yielding ""red red.""

It appears that ""bluf"" correlates to a color being repeated twice. The color that is output for ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the previous word:

- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is blue (""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"").
- If ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" it results in blue being the next color and also being repeated (""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue"").
- There isn't a direct example of ""wif"" preceding ""bluf,"" but ""lug bluf wif"" indicates that after ""bluf"" comes ""wif"" and the output is ""red,"" hence it could imply ""wif"" follows bluf, resulting in ""wif"" being ""red.""

However, we have a case where ""bluf"" is at the end in ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" and the output is ""yellow red red yellow blue."" Since the final blue is not doubled, it infers that ""bluf"" means doubling the color that would otherwise follow the word before ""bluf."" This is not applying when ""bluf"" is the last word, possibly because there's no subsequent word whose color should be doubled.

Based on this, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the following word.

Let me know if you need anything else.
Based on the examples given, we can attempt to induce the rules for the nonce word ""walm"". It seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of a color word. The color that is repeated appears to be determined by the word just before ""walm"". 

If we consider the outputs:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
3. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
4. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
5. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

We can derive the following associations:

- ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated.
- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red"" repeated.
- ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" repeated.
- ""lug"" seems to not have a direct effect on ""walm,"" but ""wif"" does, leading to ""red"" repeated after it.

Thus, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color word that is associated with the preceding word, not ""lug,"" as ""lug"" is not immediately prior to ""walm"" in the given outputs.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" results in the output of a color word repeated three times. The color word repeated is the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm"". If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is ""yellow."" If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is ""red."" If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is ""green."" If ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" (from ""lug"") followed by ""red"" (from ""wif"") repeated. The exact number of repetitions seems to depend on the number of nonce words prior to ""walm."" There may also be a modifier effect where the presence of ""dax"" may alter the pattern slightly by inserting ""green"" into the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in each given example.
By examining the given examples, we can attempt to derive what the nonce word ""dax"" means in the context of these sequences. Here's a breakdown of the given input and the corresponding output:

- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" maps to ""green blue green blue blue blue""
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" maps to ""red red green blue""
- ""dax lug wif"" maps to ""green blue red""
- ""dax"" on its own maps to ""green""
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" maps to ""green green red yellow""

Looking for patterns, we can deduce the following:

- The word ""dax"" by itself always results in ""green.""
- In combination with other words, ""dax"" still results in ""green,"" but it doesn't affect the colors produced by those other words.

Therefore, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" consistently across all given examples. There isn't enough information to derive more complex rules that involve context dependency or modification of surrounding elements.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems clear. The nonce word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples, when the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is the color that precedes ""bluf"" in the input. 

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. When ""lug wif walm lug"" is presented, it corresponds to ""blue red red red blue."" One immediate observation is that ""walm"" here is associated with the sequence ""red red red.""
2. Similarly, ""dax lug wif walm"" transforms into ""green blue red red red,"" where once again ""walm"" correlates with the sequence ""red red red.""
3. In the case of ""dax walm wif dax,"" we receive ""green green green red green."" It's clear that ""walm"" here is represented by ""green green green.""
4. ""dax walm"" solely corresponds to ""green green green,"" reinforcing the pattern that ""walm"" after ""dax"" translates to three greens.
5. Lastly, ""lug wif walm"" gives us ""blue red red red,"" again showing that ""walm"" after ""lug wif"" leads to ""red red red.""

From these observations, we can deduce a rule:
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug wif,"" it results in ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in ""green green green.""

Rule: walm -> ""green green green"" when following ""dax""; ""red red red"" when following ""lug wif"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples, it is clear that each time the word 'dax' is used, the output is 'green'. Other words ('zup', 'bluf', 'lug', 'wif') correspond to different colors as well. The position of the word 'dax' within the input sequence does not seem to affect its associated output color. Therefore, the rule can be determined as follows:

Rule: 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'. 

Written in the specific format requested:

dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can induce that each example has an ""Input"" with the word ""wif"" followed by another word, and the ""Output"" contains one or two colors.

By analyzing the ""Output"" with regards to each additional word provided in the ""Input"" alongside ""wif,"" we can attempt to induce the meaning or function of ""wif.""

Here's what we can observe:

1. ""wif lug"" consistently results in ""red blue.""
2. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""
3. ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow.""
4. When ""wif"" is presented alone, the output is simply ""red.""

From the pattern in the output, it seems that ""wif"" always produces the color ""red."" This happens irrespective of the following word or even if there is no following word.

The second part of the output, where the second color appears, seems to be dependent on the second word in the ""Input"":

- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" correlates with a repeated ""red,"" which could either be a direct correlation or signify that ""bluf"" is not associated with a new color and therefore doesn't change the initial ""red.""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

Since the word ""wif"" itself, without any additional context, yields ""red,"" we can infer that ""wif"" has a baseline output of ""red."" The additional word then either modifies this output by adding another color or reinforces the initial color based on some correlation.

Based on this evidence, the rule for ""wif"" could be stated as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" When ""wif"" is followed by another word, it outputs ""red"" plus the color associated with the additional word. If ""wif"" is not followed by any word, it only outputs ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in each context it appears. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can determine that ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"" being said twice. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: bluf translates to ""red red"".
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. wif walm dax -> red red red green
4. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow

We observe that the output seems to repeat a color for each occurrence of a word in the input before the word ""walm"" and then for ""walm"" itself. Specifically,
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" does not appear to have a corresponding output 

We do not have an example where ""walm"" is the first word, so it's impossible to deduce its standalone output from these examples alone. However, the overall pattern including ""walm"" is that the word before ""walm"" has its color repeated according to the position of ""walm."" Specifically:
- When ""walm"" is the second word, the first word's associated color is repeated twice, and then ""walm"" gets that same color once.
- When ""walm"" is the third word, the first and second word's associated color is repeated twice before and once for ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is the second word and only one word precedes it, the color is repeated three times, once for the preceding word and twice for ""walm.""

With this pattern, we deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the input to be repeated once for each occurrence of the previous word and once more for ""walm"" itself. If ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, the associated color repeats twice for the first word and once for ""walm"". If ""walm"" is the third word, the color repeats once for the third position and once more for ""walm"". If other words precede ""walm,"" only their associated colors are considered for the pattern, ignoring ""walm's"" own output. For inputs where a color can't be directly associated with a word (like ""bluf""), we cannot deduce the output based on the available information.

Therefore, walm -> the rule is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it, in line with how many times that word has occurred before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Other words also correspond to specific colors: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:

dax -> green

The general rule for this context is that each nonce word translates to a specific color in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the inputs and outputs and look for patterns associated with ""wif.""

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- ""wif"" appears twice, corresponding to the first and fourth ""red.""

Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red
- ""wif"" corresponds to the last ""red.""

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to the middle ""red.""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""

It seems that every time ""wif"" is mentioned, no matter the position, it results in ""red"" being in the output. The presence of ""wif"" does not appear to change the color associated with other words; for instance, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" whether ""wif"" precedes it or follows it. Similarly, ""zup"" consistently relates to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" regardless of the inclusion of ""wif.""

Based on the given examples, the rule for ""wif"" is that it always corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can analyze each example and look for patterns associated with the presence of the word ""zup"" and the corresponding output.

1. Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
2. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
4. Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
5. Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue

Based on the provided examples, every time we see the word ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" The outputs for other words (""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""walm"") stay consistent regardless of whether ""zup"" precedes or follows them.

Here is the rule based on the available information:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to the color red. However, in the context of being placed after the word ""wif,"" it changes to result in two instances of the color red instead of one.

Let's examine each provided example to identify the pattern:

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in red.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""bluf"" is the last word and results in double red, following a ""wif"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" after ""wif"" and results in one instance of yellow.

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" and gives double red before ""lug"".

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" is the last word and follows ""zup"" resulting in double yellow.

From these examples, we see two patterns. The first pattern is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red. The second pattern is that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it results in double red, but when it comes after other words, it might relate to a different set of rules determining the output color. However, these additional rules are not consistently illustrated with the given examples. 

To form a coherent rule, we might need more data. But with the current information, we can establish the following:

Rule: 
- ""bluf"" generally corresponds to red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to double red.

Hence, we can define bluf as generally representing the color red, with a specific rule when following ""wif"" leading to a duplication of red in the output:

bluf -> red (with the specific rule following ""wif"" resulting in red red).
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" triggers the repetition in output of the color associated with the word preceding it, until a different color word is mentioned. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. The sequence ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated until a new color word ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") appears, and then the sequence closes with ""dax"" again for ""green"".

2. In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", the output is ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". After ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated. No new color word appears between ""walm"" and ""lug"", so ""walm"" triggers the repetition of ""yellow"" until ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue"".

3. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"". After ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""red"".

4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". After the first ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" until ""zup"" (yellow) appears, and after the second ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" again without a new color word interrupting.

5. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". After ""zup"" (yellow), the ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated until the color sequence is changed by ""wif"" (red).

Rule:
walm -> Triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word until a new color word is mentioned. If no new color word is present after ""walm"", it keeps repeating the last color mentioned before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,165
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it is translated as ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine each input and its corresponding output in parallel:

1. Input: wif dax zup wif
   Output: red green yellow red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and appears twice at the beginning and end, indicating position-based consistency.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" appears between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" and ""green"" appears between ""red"" and ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" appears at the beginning, and ""green"" is the first color.
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" but we have no other examples to confirm this.

3. Input: lug zup dax lug dax
   Output: blue yellow green blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and appears twice, at the beginning and after ""zup,"" indicating position-based consistency.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the first example.
   - ""dax"" appears twice, both times followed by ""green.""

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" consistent with previous examples.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" consistent with the first example.
   - ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and ""green"" follows in the output.
   - ""bluf"" is a new word, but it corresponds to ""green."" However, since ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" doesn't provide additional information about ""dax.""

5. Input: zup lug dax
   Output: yellow blue green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" consistent with the previous examples.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" consistent with the previous examples.
   - ""dax"" appears after ""zup"" and ""lug,"" with ""green"" following in the output.

Based on these observations, regardless of its position, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green."" There is no indication that the meaning of ""dax"" changes depending on context or position. 

Thus, the rule for ""dax"" can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Every instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position. There are no counterexamples or variations in the input-output pairs to suggest that ""wif"" means anything other than ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Meaning: The nonce word ""wif"" means the color red.
Reviewing the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence. Here's the evidence that supports this conclusion:

- ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" so ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow.""
- ""wif lug zup"" translates to ""red blue yellow,"" so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule is:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the color blue. Moreover, ""bluf"" always appears immediately after a word that translates to the color immediately preceding blue in the examples.

To summarize the rule for ""bluf"" using the examples:

1. zup lug -> yellow blue; ""bluf"" follows and translates to blue.
2. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green; ""bluf"" follows green and is again blue, succeeded by green (wif) and blue (lug).
3. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue; ""bluf"" follows blue and translates to blue, succeeded by red (wif).
4. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow; ""bluf"" follows yellow (zup) and translates to yellow.
5. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue; ""bluf"" follows blue and translates to blue.

From these examples, the term ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that comes before itself, meaning it copies the color of the previous term.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the word preceding it. If the preceding word translates to a color, ""bluf"" translates to that same color.
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, we can induce the following pattern:

- Whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the color that precedes ""walm"" is repeated until the word ""wif"" appears. After ""wif,"" the color pattern changes according to what color the word represents. If no color word precedes ""walm,"" the output is red until ""wif"" appears.

Let's check this rule against the given examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" represents green, so ""green"" is repeated up to ""wif,"" then ""wif"" is red.

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - Here, ""lug"" represents blue, so ""blue"" is repeated up to ""wif,"" then ""wif"" is red, and the pattern continues with ""lug"" as blue.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""zup"" represents yellow and ""lug"" represents blue, but only blue is repeated since it comes right before ""walm."" After ""wif,"" ""dax"" represents green.

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - There's no color word before ""walm,"" hence the output is red up to ""wif,"" and ""wif"" itself is red.

5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" represents yellow, so ""yellow"" is repeated. Since there is no occurrence of ""wif"" after ""walm,"" no red is output. The next word ""lug"" represents blue.

Rule: walm -> causes the output to repeat the color represented by the word directly preceding it until the word ""wif"" appears, at which point the color represented by ""wif"" is red, and normal color output resumes after ""wif."" If no color word precedes it, the output is red until ""wif.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

- Input: lug | Output: blue
- Input: dax zup lug | Output: green yellow blue
- Input: lug | Output: blue

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""red."" Each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. It does not seem to matter what other words are present; ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare each input containing ""bluf"" with its corresponding output, looking for patterns that might help us understand what ""bluf"" translates to:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

2. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" In the output, the word following ""yellow"" is also ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" In the output, the word following ""blue"" is also ""blue.""
- In example 2 again, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" In the output, the word following ""green"" is also ""green.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" In the output, the word following ""red"" is also ""red.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is the last word, and it follows ""lug,"" which again translates to ""blue."" The last color in the output is also ""blue.""

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color represented by the word just before it. Therefore, ""bluf"" functions as a repeat of the preceding color in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a color that is repeated multiple times. The color appears to correspond to the color indicated by the word that precedes ""walm,"" and the number of times the color is repeated after ""walm"" matches the number of times the preceding color word appears in the input.

Let us review the examples to figure out the rule:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and appears twice before ""walm."" ""Wif"" translates to ""red"" and appears once before ""walm."" Following ""walm,"" we see ""red"" repeated three times – matching the number of times ""red"" precedes ""walm.""

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" ""Walm"" occurs after ""zup"" and the output is three ""yellow,"" which matches the number of times ""yellow"" precedes ""walm.""

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""Lug"" translates to ""blue."" Since ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times, matching the number of times ""blue"" precedes ""walm"" (in this case, once but repeated threefold).

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Both ""dax"" and ""lug"" appear twice before ""walm."" However, ""lug"" is the most recent word before ""walm,"" thus ""blue"" is the color that is repeated in the output, and the number of times ""blue"" appears matches the total occurrences of ""lug"" — four times.

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   ""Lug"" translates to ""blue"" and appears before ""walm."" After ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times, consistent with the repetition rule.

So, the rule seems to be:

**Walm** -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word that appears directly before ""walm,"" and does so as many times as the word for that color has appeared in the sequence up to the point where ""walm"" appears.

Rule: If a color word is followed by the nonce word ""walm,"" then in the output the corresponding color will be repeated as many times as the color word appeared before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: In each example, the word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"" in the output. No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the other words accompanying it, the output always includes ""green"" at the point where ""dax"" appears in the input. Therefore, ""dax"" means ""green.""
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the common factor in each sequence where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: dax bluf lug wif | Output: green green blue red
3. Input: wif zup | Output: red yellow
4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf | Output: blue red blue green green
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug | Output: red yellow yellow blue

From these examples, we observe that each time the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is the output. This pattern is consistent regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the sequence or the words that surround it.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow'. The other words also seem to correspond to specific colors: 'dax' to 'green', 'lug' to 'blue', 'wif' to 'red', and 'bluf' seems to be associated with 'green' or 'red' depending on its position (but since the task is only to deduce the meaning of zup, we will not further analyze 'bluf').

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> 'yellow'
Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

5. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green

To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each occurrence and its output. In every case where ""bluf"" appears, the word that precedes it has a color associated with it that is repeated in the output immediately following ""bluf"":

1. ""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow

2. ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue

4. ""wif bluf"" -> red red

""Bulf"" may mean to repeat the color of the preceding word. Let's check this with the more complex examples:

2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which correlates to ""yellow"" and outputs yellow directly after ""bluf"".

5. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""
Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which correlates to ""red"" and thus outputs red directly after.

The rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: Repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word before it.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is a repetition of the color indicated by the word that immediately precedes it. If that word is ""zup,"" ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""; if it is ""lug,"" ""walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue,"" and if it's ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green green."" In essence, ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, it repeats that color's name three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the output. Regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following mappings from the input words to the output colors:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red

Each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The presence of ""dax"" in each input results in the word ""green"" appearing in the corresponding output at the position where ""dax"" appeared in the input. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" can be consistently translated to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" is:

**Rule:** wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color:

- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, no matter where it appears in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> green.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents the color green. Whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned, it is replaced with the word ""green"" the same number of times as the word that precedes it. For example, if the input is ""wif bluf,"" since ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and is mentioned once before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red green."" If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which means blue and is mentioned once before ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue green."" The word ""bluf"" consistently becomes ""green"" the number of times of the preceding color word.
Reviewing the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. For instance, if ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the color sequence is ""red red."" The sequence ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green,"" suggesting the same rule applies there as well.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" When ""dax"" appears in different sequences with other nonce words, those nonce words correspond to different colors, but ""dax"" remains unchanged in its meaning.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule:
- ""dax"" -> green

The meanings of the other nonce words in the context of these examples can be inferred as follows, although you did not ask for these:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""walm"" -> green (since it produces the output ""green"" when preceded by ""dax,"" which we have established to mean green)
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Regardless of its position in the input or the presence of other words, ""wif"" always results in the output ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that the occurrence of the word ""zup"" directly affects the colors mentioned in the outputs. When ""zup"" is present in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Furthermore, it seems to also turn the immediately following word into ""yellow"" regardless of the word's original assigned color.

Looking closer, we can see that:

- ""wif"" normally corresponds to ""red,"" but when it follows ""zup,"" it becomes ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" normally corresponds to ""blue,"" but when it follows ""zup,"" it becomes ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" normally corresponds to ""green,"" but when it follows ""zup,"" it becomes ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" normally corresponds to ""green"" in the absence of ""zup,"" but with ""zup"" preceding, ""walm"" also becomes ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" is that it changes its color and the color of the following word to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> Changes itself and the following word to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's assess each instance where it is used in the provided examples:

- Example 1: ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" → ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow""
- Example 2: ""wif lug bluf"" → ""red blue blue""
- Example 3: ""dax bluf"" → ""green green""
- Example 4: ""zup wif bluf zup"" → ""yellow red red yellow""
- Example 5: ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" → ""red yellow yellow red green""

Analyzing the context in which ""bluf"" appears, we observe the following pattern:

1. When ""bluf"" follows a word (e.g., ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""wif""), the color after ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word before ""bluf"". 
2. In instances where ""bluf"" is followed by another instance of ""bluf"" (see Example 1), the pattern of repeating the previous color continues.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" represents a rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated.

Therefore:

bluf -> The previous color is repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must find common elements in each sequence that could account for the behavior of the word ""walm."" 

We can see that after the ""walm"" word is used, a sequence of color words is repeated three times:

1. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
2. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"". After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
3. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"". Again, after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
4. ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green"". After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
5. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

From these observations, we can infer a rule: the word ""walm"" causes the color word that follows it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the following color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every instance it is used within the examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique input word maps to a unique color in the output:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow (it does not seem to change color based on the provided examples)

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of dax is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" can be deduced by comparing the inputs and outputs. 

In each output, the color ""red"" appears exactly once per occurrence of ""wif"" in the input:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which implies that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" which further confirms that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""green green red blue,"" which again shows that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red,"" where ""wif"" preceding ""bluf"" converts to ""red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue,"" where the occurrence of ""wif"" once again becomes ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". In every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the relationship between the input and output sequences. Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and since ""bluf"" follows, and the output is also ""red"", we might initially think ""bluf"" also means ""red"".

2. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Since ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow"" again, ""bluf"" may mean repeating the last color mentioned.

3. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" follows with ""blue"" again in the output, ""zup"" then gives ""yellow"". This supports the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color mentioned before it.

4. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" follows with ""green"" again in the output. Here ""wif"" is at the end, giving ""red"" in the output. This further supports the repeat rule for ""bluf"".

5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", ""wif"" with ""red"", and ""zup"" with ""yellow"". The sequence ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow"", with ""bluf"" repeating the ""yellow"" from ""zup"".

Based on the patterns observed, the word ""bluf"" seems to mean that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" should be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs, focusing on the position and repetition of ""walm"" and the corresponding output.

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is three yellows. ""Zup"" is associated with a single ""yellow."" Since there's a repetition of ""yellow,"" it suggests ""walm"" may indicate repetition of the previous color.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Here ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" and again, the output is a repetition of yellow (""yellow yellow yellow""). ""Dax"" outputs green and ""wif"" outputs red. ""Bluf"" seems to double the last color ""red red."" The rest of the words maintain a one-to-one correspondence with their colors.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

The third example is the same as the first, reinforcing the rule deduced.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is three reds. This is consistent with the rule that ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat three times.

5. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three greens after a single ""green."" The rule appears to hold again.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every provided example.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red"". Regardless of its position in the input sentence, whenever ""wif"" is present, the output includes ""red"". Let's verify this against each provided input and output pair:

Input: wif zup  
Output: red yellow  
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm  
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red  
- ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red"" each time.

Input: wif dax  
Output: red green  
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: zup lug zup lug wif  
Output: yellow blue yellow blue red  
- ""wif"" is the last word and corresponds to ""red""

Input: lug zup dax wif  
Output: blue yellow green red  
- ""wif"" is the last word and corresponds to ""red""

From the consistent replacements, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" is systematically related to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is present, the word ""yellow"" is produced in the output. The context or position of ""zup"" within the input does not seem to change its associated output color:

- ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow,"" indicating that ""dax"" means ""green,"" whereas ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red,"" which implies that ""wif"" means ""red.""
- ""zup wif bluf zup"" results in ""yellow red red yellow,"" showing that ""bluf"" is likely ""red"" and ""zup"" maintains its meaning of ""yellow"" at both occurrences.
- A single ""zup"" produces ""yellow.""
- ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green,"" suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" and ""dax"" sustain their meanings as ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is the same as the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Here is the rule induction based on the given examples:

- In the first example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax,"" ""lug"" translates to blue, and the ""bluf"" that immediately follows translates to blue as well. Likewise, ""zup"" translates to yellow, and the ""bluf"" that follows translates to yellow again.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" both ""bluf"" instances follow ""wif,"" which translates to red, so both ""bluf""s translate to red.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug,"" the ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to red, the same as ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" the ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and therefore translates to yellow, like ""zup.""
- Lastly, in the example ""zup bluf,"" the ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to yellow.

Rule: bluf translates to the color represented by the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example input and its associated output, trying to find a pattern related to the word's placement and the color that results.

1. lug walm wif lug
   blue blue blue red blue
   - Every ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""wif"" to red. The ""walm"" here precedes ""wif"" and results in blue, which is the same as ""lug."" 

2. lug zup walm lug
   blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the color for ""walm"" is yellow, the same as for ""zup."" 

3. lug walm dax wif lug wif
   blue blue blue green red blue red
   - Here, ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and its output is blue. ""dax"" results in green and ""wif"" in red, both different from the output of ""walm.""

4. dax wif walm lug zup
   green red red red blue yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug."" Its output is red, which is the same as ""wif."" 

5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and its output is blue, which is the same as ""lug.""

Based on the above examples, ""walm"" appears to take the color of the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word before it. If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it is blue. If it follows ""wif,"" it is red. If it follows ""zup,"" it is yellow. If it follows ""dax,"" it becomes green. This rule explains each instance of ""walm"" and its associated color in the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,172
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. This pattern persists regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the sequence or the presence of other words. 

For instance:
- When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is simply ""blue.""
- When ""lug dax"" is given, the output is ""blue green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the input ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" considering the other outputs, it can be deduced that each word corresponds to a color, with ""lug"" specifically mapping to ""blue"" and ""dax"" following it as ""green.""
- Similarly, ""zup dax lug"" correlates to ""yellow green blue,"" matching the individual colors to each word in order with ""lug"" being ""blue"" at the end.

Given the consistency of ""lug"" mapping to ""blue"" in all examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Judging from the provided examples, the rule seems to be connected to the position of ""wif"" relative to the other words. Here's the pattern I notice:

- When ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is green.
- When ""wif"" stands alone or is not preceded by ""bluf,"" the output is red.
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to affect the output colors for other words, as ""lug"" consistently corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" consistently corresponds to yellow.

Based on these patterns, the rule for ""wif"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: If ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is green. If ""wif"" is in any other position, the output is red.

wif -> meaning: The meaning of ""wif"" depends on the context:
- ""wif"" after ""bluf"" means green.
- ""wif"" in any other position means red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- Other words in the sequence correspond to different colors (e.g., ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"").

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the patterns in the provided input and output pairs.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Looking at these examples, we notice that whenever ""bluf"" is present, the output includes the color that immediately preceded ""bluf"" in the input:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following it is ""bluf,"" which also corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, the last ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, again ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

Given the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word preceding ""bluf.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples provided against their respective outputs.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

3. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

Looking at the occurrences of ""walm"" in the examples, we observe the following patterns:

- In examples 1 and 2, each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by an output of three colors: the same color is repeated three times. In example 1, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" and the output yields three greens corresponding to ""dax."" In example 2, ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" and the output yields three reds corresponding to ""wif.""

- Examples 3 and 4 show that ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is three yellows, indicating a possible relationship with ""zup"" which is also associated with the color yellow.

- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the colors green green green appear in the output, which corresponds to ""dax"" being associated with green.

From these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the next word three times. If ""walm"" is the last word and there is no word to follow, it takes the color of the word before it, as seen in example 1, where the last ""walm"" yields three blues corresponding to ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the following word three times, or if it is the last word, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning is the color ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
Based on the examples given, where the word ""dax"" appears to correlate with a particular output each time it is used, we can deduce the following meaning:

Rule: dax -> green

Every time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. This consistent pattern supports the rule.
Based on the given examples, the pattern suggests that each nonce word maps to a specific color, and the mapping remains consistent across different examples. Let's start by examining the occurrences of the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which corresponds to ""red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears before ""bluf lug"" which translates to ""red red blue,"" reaffirming that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The third example again shows ""wif"" mapping to ""red.""
- The fourth example has ""wif"" on its own at the end of the sequence, and it maps to ""red,"" which is consistent with the previous findings.
- Finally, in the fifth example, despite ""wif"" being surrounded by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" still translates to ""red.""

Considering all examples, the rule seems clear and consistent that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"" regardless of the context or the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it.

In every example, the color that follows ""bluf"" is the same as the color that precedes it:

- In example 1, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"".
- In example 2, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"".
- In example 3, the second ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and both correspond to ""yellow yellow"".
- In example 4, ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue"" and later ""dax zup bluf"" has ""green yellow yellow"", where the ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"".
- Example 5 is again ""lug bluf"" which corresponds to ""blue blue"".

Given this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" is clear.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.
walm -> meaning. Rule: walm means to repeat the color of the previous word multiple times. It appears that the repetition occurs three times for every occurrence of the word ""walm."" If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which means yellow, then ""walm"" results in three yellows. If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which means blue, then ""walm"" results in three blues, and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word is consistently associated with a specific color in the output. Using the input and corresponding output, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""lug.""

1. From the first example:
   - Input: lug
   - Output: blue
   This example directly indicates that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

2. For the second and fifth examples, which are identical:
   - Input: lug walm dax
   - Output: blue blue blue green
   Since ""lug"" appears first and the first color in the output is blue, this again supports that ""lug"" means blue. Assuming that each word maps to a color, it appears that ""walm"" also means blue and ""dax"" means green.

3. From the third example:
   - Input: lug dax lug
   - Output: blue green blue
   This example further enforces the rule that ""lug"" means blue because it appears twice, and both times the corresponding output is blue.

4. For the fourth example:
   - Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   - Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   This example does not direct involve ""lug,"" but because ""lug"" correlates to blue, and ""dax"" to green from previous examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" likely means blue as well and ""zup"" likely means yellow (since the words and colors are repeated and correspond with one another).

Given the consistency across the examples, it is reasonable to deduce that ""lug"" specifically means the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every occurrence of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output.
Observing the examples, we can try to determine the meaning of the word ""wif"" by looking for patterns in the input and their corresponding output.

Firstly, let's see how the word ""wif"" appears in the inputs and its correlation to the outputs:

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif  
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red  
Pattern: 'wif' follows 'dax' -> 'red' before 'lug' -> 'blue'

Input: zup wif walm  
Output: yellow red red red  
Pattern: 'wif' follows 'zup' -> 'red'

Input: wif lug  
Output: red blue  
Pattern: 'wif' stands alone before 'lug' -> 'red'

Input: wif  
Output: red  
Pattern: 'wif' stands alone -> 'red'

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif  
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red  
Pattern: 'wif' follows 'dax' -> 'red'

By analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can see that every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is 'red', regardless of the words that come before or after it. 

Rule: wif -> red

The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color 'red' in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in each provided example.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Examine each instance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output:

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
4. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
5. zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- The presence of ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color green being repeated in the output.
- The repetition of the color in the output is exactly once per ""bluf"" in the input.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" appears twice, and we have the color green repeated twice in the same sequence: ""yellow green green"" and then later ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" does not alter the output of the words around it but simply adds an additional green to follow any sequence that precedes it.

Based on this analysis, the rule could be:

Rule: bluf -> the word following ""bluf"" in the input sequence always translates to the color green in the output sequence. If there's a word before ""bluf"" that translates to green as well, then ""bluf"" repeats the output associated with that preceding word.
Looking at the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word 'walm' corresponds to a repetition of the color that comes before it. Let's break down each example to illustrate this:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   'walm' follows 'lug', which is 'blue', thus 'walm' generates 'blue blue blue'.

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   'walm' follows 'wif', which is 'red', thus 'walm' generates 'red red red'.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   'walm' follows 'zup', which is 'yellow', thus 'walm' generates 'yellow yellow yellow'.

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   'walm' follows 'lug', which is 'blue', thus 'walm' generates 'blue blue blue'.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   'walm' follows 'wif', which is 'red', thus 'walm' generates 'red red red'.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the rule for 'walm':

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the preceding color's name thrice.

Therefore, 'walm' means to repeat the previous color name three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green green,green green green,False,175
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

Explanation: In every instance of the examples provided, the appearance of the nonce word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. This consistency allows us to deduce that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, and it is repeated twice. For example, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, so ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for a pattern in each example where the word ""walm"" appears and what follows it in the output.

Let's analyze:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

2. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

We observe that ""walm"" always results in a sequence of yellow outputs or a single yellow when succeeding ""zup"". We can also observe that the number of yellows after each ""walm"" seems to correspond with the number of words preceding ""walm"". For instance:

- In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by two words and followed by three yellows.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is preceded by five words and followed by three yellows.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by three words and followed by a single yellow.

However, in the last example, ""walm"" is preceded by a single word and yet is followed by three blues.

From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" might translate into repetitions of the color determined by the word that precedes it, rather than being directly translated to ""yellow"". It's likely that the output for ""walm"" is contingent on the preceding word, indicating a replication rule.

The exception to the replication rule is the combination ""zup walm"", which consistently outputs ""yellow"". This suggests that ""zup"" changes the output associated with ""walm"" to ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows the word ""zup"", it outputs ""yellow"". Otherwise, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"", with the number of repetitions matching the number of instances that color has appeared consecutively before ""walm"".

So let's break down example 5: 

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and there is a triplet of ""blue"" in the output.

Based on our formulated rule and the fact that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and precedes ""walm"" without other colors interrupting, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" duplicates the color corresponding to the preceding word the number of times that color has already consecutively appeared.

Hence, we can conclude:

walm -> Causes the repetition of the color output associated with the immediately preceding word, except when following ""zup"", where it results in ""yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,176
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' represents the color 'green' regardless of its position in the sequence.
Reviewing the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can examine the color correlated with the word ""wif"" in each instance:

- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
- Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
- Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow

In every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is produced in the output. It is the consistent result across all examples. Therefore, it seems clear that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we observe the following:

- Every time the word zup is mentioned, it is translated to the color yellow in the output.
- Other words correspond to other colors, such as dax to green, lug to blue, etc.
- The position of zup in the input does not seem to affect its output which consistently remains yellow.

From these observations, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each example and the associated output.

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue

3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

Observations:
- Every occurrence of ""bluf"" leads to the word ""red"" in the output.
- Additionally, ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the output color before it.

Based on these observations, a rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Duplicate the color before ""bluf"" in the output. 

So, the meaning of ""bluf"" results in the duplication of the immediately preceding color in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""walm"" dictates the color that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output. Each unique color word is translated into its corresponding color stated three times in the output if followed by the word ""walm."" Additionally, when the word ""dax"" is present after ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is added as a fourth output.

Here are the observed patterns:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" adds ""green"" to the end.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" once more adds ""green"" at the end.
- ""lug walm"" is repeated, confirming ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" with ""walm"" enforcing the triple repetition.

Therefore, the rule deduced for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When following a color word, ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated three times in the output. If the sequence is followed by ""dax,"" then ""green"" is appended as the fourth color in the output.

walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug
    ",Output: red red red blue,red red red blue,True,177
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Based on the given examples, lug consistently translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: lug means blue.
In order to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" from the given examples, we need to look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red""
2. ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""
3. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""

The word ""dax"" appears in different positions in the input, but ""green"" always appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can induce that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each instance where the word ""wif"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the same position.

Here is the breakdown:
- dax lug wif -> green blue red
- lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
- wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
- wif dax wif lug wif -> red green red blue red
- zup wif -> yellow red

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for the colors corresponding to the words:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" since it consistently appears as ""red"" in the outputs.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" since it consistently appears as ""yellow"" in the outputs.
- ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color ""yellow,"" the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of syllables in the word ""walm"" (one syllable, one ""yellow"").
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" since the output of ""zup lug"" is ""yellow blue,"" and based on the deduction below, ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Following this, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" across all examples.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the color preceding it to be repeated in the output. Here are the specific observations supporting this:

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow green."" ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The word ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated before ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" Here, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated twice.

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated twice.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green."" Here, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated before ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif zup dax,"" the output is ""green green red yellow green."" Here, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and ""green"" is repeated. ""Wif"" follows and is associated with ""red,"" and then ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" followed by ""dax"" with ""green"" again.

From these observables, it seems clear that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it causes the color related to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Walm -> meaning. 

Considering the input and output sequences provided, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" seems to depend on the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The output for ""walm"" is a series of the same color word that was the output for the preceding word in the input.

Here's a breakdown based on the input-output pairs to establish this rule:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Rule: The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue."" Hence, ""walm"" translates to repeated ""blue.""

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which outputs ""red."" Hence, ""walm"" translates to repeated ""red.""

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Rule: The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which outputs ""green."" Hence, ""walm"" translates to repeated ""green.""

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Rule: The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which outputs ""red."" Hence, ""walm"" translates to repeated ""red.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Rule: The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which outputs ""red."" Hence, ""walm"" translates to repeated ""red,"" until the next color appears.

The repeated color continues until a new color-associated word is presented after ""walm."" Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as follows:

Rule: ""Walm"" translates to a repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately before ""walm"" in the input, continuing until a new different color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,178
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" appears to consistently correspond to the output color ""blue."" Other words in the input correspond to different colors, specifically ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. The appearance and order of these words in the input are directly mirrored by their respective colors in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems consistently associated with a specific output color, which is ""green."" Other words in the list correspond with different colors and are not consistent like ""dax."" For instance, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it appears before ""dax,"" but ""red"" otherwise, showing that it might be context-dependent. ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Given this pattern, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" is directly linked to the color green, regardless of its position in the list.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each instance of a nonce word maps to a specific color. From the given examples, we can see that ""wif"" consistently maps to the color red. Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be:

wif -> red. Rule: ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following about the word 'zup':

1. When 'zup' is used alone as an input, the output is a single color ('yellow').

2. When 'zup' appears with other words in a sequence:
   - 'zup' consistently results in 'yellow'.
   - The presence of the word 'walm' following 'zup' appears to multiply the occurrence of 'yellow' in the output, with each instance of 'walm' after a single 'zup' adding two additional 'yellows'. For example:
     - 'zup walm' -> 'yellow yellow yellow' (two extra yellows)
     - 'zup walm walm' would likely result in 'yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow' if we were to follow the rule (each 'walm' after 'zup' adds two more 'yellows').
   - Other words such as 'lug', 'wif', 'dax', and 'bluf' translate to 'blue', 'red', 'green', and 'red' respectively, and they do not seem to affect the occurrence of the color from 'zup'.

Therefore, the rule for 'zup' seems to be that it translates to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in a sequence. When immediately followed by the word 'walm', it seems to imply a repetition of 'yellow' dependent on the number of times 'walm' is mentioned. 

Rule: When the input contains the word 'zup', the output is 'yellow', and if 'walm' follows 'zup', each 'walm' after 'zup' adds two more 'yellow' to the output sequence. Other words in the sequence do not appear to affect the occurrence of 'yellow' but instead translate into their respective colors.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repeated output of the color directly preceding it. 

To confirm this rule, let's inspect each given example and the color mentioned right before ""bluf"":

1. Input: ""lug bluf zup"" 
   Output: ""blue blue yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is repeated as ""blue"" again right after ""bluf.""

2. Input: ""dax bluf""
   Output: ""green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is repeated as ""green"" again right after ""bluf.""

3. Input: ""zup dax bluf zup dax""
   Output: ""yellow green green yellow green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is repeated as ""green"" right after ""bluf.""

4. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup""
   Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is repeated as ""yellow"" right after ""bluf.""

5. Input: ""wif bluf dax""
   Output: ""red red green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is repeated as ""red"" right after ""bluf.""

So the rule is:

bluf -> meaning. Bluf means to repeat the color word that comes just before it.

Rule: If a color word precedes ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" causes that color word to be repeated in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. We can attribute a color to each nonce word based on the examples: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and so on. When ""walm"" follows one of these words, the output is the corresponding color repeated three times.

Here are how the rules apply for each example:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

2. dax walm -> green green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

3. dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow"" (seen in the output), and the final ""wif"" is again ""red."" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so the output for ""walm"" is ""red"" repeated three times.

4. wif zup lug dax zup walm
   ""walm"" follows after ""zup,"" and as we can see, the last color before ""walm"" is ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup""), so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

5. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   The ""walm"" in this sequence comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times. ""lug"" after ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" and the final ""wif"" is ""red.""

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example where the word lug appears, the output is consistently blue, regardless of the position of lug or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples provided:

- The first example shows ""lug dax"" leads to ""blue green."" Since ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" we can tentatively hypothesize that ""dax"" correlates to ""green.""
- The second example is the same as the first one, further supporting our initial hypothesis.
- The third example, ""dax walm,"" results in ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" is the first word, and ""green"" is the first color in the output, this supports our hypothesis that ""dax"" means ""green."" However, we don't have enough information to determine what ""walm"" means.
- The fourth example, ""dax zup lug wif lug,"" results in ""green yellow blue red blue."" Since we've consistently seen ""lug"" as ""blue,"" and ""dax"" at the beginning correlates to ""green,"" we can match ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" maintaining ""dax"" as ""green.""
- The fifth example, ""dax bluf lug wif,"" results in ""green green blue red."" It fits the hypothesis that ""dax"" means ""green,"" and considering ""lug"" as ""blue,"" and ""wif"" as ""red,"" continues to make sense.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

- lug dax zup dax wif -> blue green yellow green red
- wif -> red
- dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
- wif -> red
- lug wif dax -> blue red green

The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in all the examples provided. There are no contexts given where ""wif"" leads to a different output.

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"" within these given examples, we will first examine each example and establish a relationship between the inputs and outputs.

- In the first example, ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- The second example is ""zup walm"", which yields ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" again matches with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color ""yellow"".
- For the inputs that are simply ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"". This confirms the one-to-one correspondence between ""zup"" and ""yellow"".
- The last example is ""zup wif dax walm"", translating to ""yellow red green green green"". Here, ""zup"" matches ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green"", and ""walm"" once again shows a repetition, but this time of ""green"".

The probable rule here is that ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"". Furthermore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it, for as many times as itself plus one additional time (e.g., ""walm"" after ""dax"" led to ""green green green"").

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
From the given examples, we can observe that ""bluf"" seems to directly translate to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""bluf"" occurs, it corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding words. The rule appears to be consistent in the given examples:

Rule: bluf -> green.
Observing the examples you've provided, I will now deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'walm' through pattern recognition.

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
Here, 'zup' leads to 'yellow', 'lug' leads to 'blue', and 'walm' results in three additional 'blue'.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Here, 'dax' appears to lead to 'green', and 'walm' results in two additional 'green'.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
'Dax' gives 'green', 'walm' gives two additional 'green', 'wif' translates to 'red', another 'walm' gives two additional 'red', then 'zup' gives 'yellow'.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
'Lug' translates to 'blue', 'dax' to 'green', and 'walm' gives two additional 'green'.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
'Dax' leads to 'green', 'zup' to 'yellow', 'walm' adds two more 'yellow', and 'wif' leads to 'red'.

With the provided examples, the following rule for 'walm' can be induced:

Rule: 
'walm' causes the color word that immediately precedes it to be repeated two more times.

Walm -> The word before 'walm' is repeated two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" correlates with the color green in the outputs. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input leads to ""green"" in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, I observe the following patterns:

1. Each input word correlates to a specific color in the output.
2. The word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"" in the output, no matter its position in the input sequence.
3. The words prior to ""wif"" determine the other colors that precede ""red"" in the output.

Thus, the following associations can be made:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

So, ""wif"" is consistently producing ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or other words present.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
bluf -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the output is ""blue;"" if ""wif,"" then ""red;"" if ""zup,"" then ""yellow;"" if ""dax,"" then ""green.""

Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence three times. Here's the breakdown of each example with this rule applied:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is then repeated three times.

- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" results in ""green blue blue blue green red red green"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated three times, and the other words correspond to their respective colors that follow their normal pattern.

- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is then repeated three times, and the other words maintain their color meanings.

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is then repeated three times.

- ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated three times, followed by the color that ""dax"" corresponds to, which is ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that directly precedes ""walm"" three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" and each usage of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" appearing in the output sequence. The other words correspond to different colors: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" and ""zup"" to multipliers for the following color, with ""walm"" tripling the following color and ""zup"" doubling it. ""Bluf"" seems to behave similarly to ""dax"" as it translates directly to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples where the nonce word ""wif"" appears, it consistently corresponds to the color ""red"":

- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- lug dax zup lug wif -> blue green yellow blue red
- zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
- wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
- wif dax -> red green

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we need to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""zup.""

Here's the analysis of each input and output pair:

1. In the first example, ""dax zup wif"" maps to ""green yellow red."" Since ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" by elimination ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" results in ""yellow blue red green green red."" We already know that ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and we have deduced that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow."" Therefore, ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" must map to ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""wif zup bluf lug"" gives ""red yellow yellow blue."" From the previous examples, ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" maps to ""green"" (but here it's ""yellow"" — this discrepancy suggests that ""bluf"" does not consistently map to ""green,"" indicating that our prior conclusion was incorrect, or that ""bluf"" has variable meanings based on context), and ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and the presence of ""zup"" gives ""yellow"" again, which supports the idea that ""zup"" indeed maps to ""yellow."" ""walm"" is new, and with it mapping to ""green,"" this suggests that it might mean ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup lug"" maps to ""yellow blue."" Given prior outputs, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

Given the consistent mapping of ""zup"" to ""yellow"" across the examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> replicate the color associated with the previous word.

To arrive at this rule, let's look at each example:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue

In examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and the output is red repeated twice, suggesting that ""bluf"" means to double the color of the word just before it.

In example 3, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and with ""bluf"" following it, the output is green repeated, supporting the rule.

In example 4, we have two words before ""bluf,"" but only the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" (which is ""wif"" -> red) is replicated.

In example 5, ""wif"" and ""lug"" switch positions, and this time ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" so its associated color (blue) is replicated.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be to take the color associated with the word immediately preceding it and repeat it.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word, with the number of repetitions equal to three. Each of the given input words outside of ""walm"" corresponds to a specific color: ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. Thus, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word 'lug' appears in the input, it corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. It acts as a standalone element that does not appear to change meaning in relation to other words surrounding it. Therefore, we can conclude that:

wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" always represents the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Thus, we can deduce that:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.
Observing the inputs and corresponding outputs, it appears that every time the nonce word ""bluf"" is present in the input, the output contains a repeated color. This repetition corresponds to the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence. 

Based on the given examples, here is the pattern:

1. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
3. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
4. Input: zup lug bluf -> Output: yellow blue blue
5. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green

It seems that the color before ""bluf"" is repeated once if ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, and this color repetition matches exactly the position of ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" is after ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated.
- When ""bluf"" is after ""zup"", ""yellow"" is repeated.
- When ""bluf"" is after ""lug"", ""blue"" is repeated.
- When ""bluf"" is in the middle of the sequence, the color corresponding to ""bluf"" itself is doubled.

Rule: bluf -> The color that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the input is repeated in the output once if ""bluf"" is at the end, or by doubling the output color that corresponds to ""bluf"" itself if it's in the middle.
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color word that follows it. If no color word follows it, then repeat the previous color. 

In each case:
- The presence of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color word that immediately follows it three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or no color word follows, we use the color word immediately before ""walm"" and repeat it three times.

Let's verify the rule with the provided examples:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
   - Following ""walm,"" there is no color word, so it repeats the color blue three times.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
   - Following ""walm,"" the color word is ""wif"" which corresponds to red, but according to the rule, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color word immediately after it (in this case, yellow) three times before moving on to the next color word.

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
   - Following ""walm,"" there is no color word, so it repeats the color red three times.

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
   - Following ""walm,"" the color words are ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow), but ""walm"" only affects the first color word immediately following it, so it repeats blue three times before moving to the next color word which is yellow.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
   - Following ""walm,"" there is no color word, so it repeats the color blue three times.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: causes the next color word to repeat three times; if no color word follows, repeat the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the output color is determined by the position of words in the input sequence. Here is the pattern:

- When 'dax' appears, the output is 'green'.
- When 'wif' appears, the output is 'red'.
- When 'zup' appears, the output is 'yellow'.
- When 'lug' appears, the output is 'blue'.

The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the output 'green', regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word wif translates to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine each example and find the pattern associated with the word.

1. In the first example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green blue red red."" The word ""bluf"" appears at the end, as does the color ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" and both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color ""blue.""

3. The third example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" Here ""bluf"" is in the fourth position, and the corresponding color is ""yellow,"" the same as the color for ""zup.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Thus, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and both correspond to the color ""red.""

5. The fifth example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" In this case, ""bluf"" comes after three instances of ""zup"" and the corresponding color for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" the same as the color for ""zup.""

Looking at the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs, specifically where ""walm"" appears and the sequence it maps to:

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""walm"" appears, it corresponds to three consecutive instances of the same color in the output. The colors themselves correspond to other words in the input.

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green,"" and subsequent ""walm"" generates three more ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" generates three more ""yellow.""
- The third example further supports the association of ""dax"" with ""green,"" as ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and produces three ""green.""
- The fourth and fifth examples introduce ""wif"" and provide outputs consistent with ""red."" ""Walm"" follows and triples the output color accordingly.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,184
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's examine each instance where it appears and the associated color in the output:

- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" where ""lug"" precedes a ""blue.""
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""lug"" precedes either ""blue"" or ""yellow"" (note that ""lug"" precedes ""lug"" in one case, resulting in ""blue"").
- ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" and ""lug"" is at the end, associated with ""blue.""
- ""lug zup"" results in ""blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- ""wif lug dax"" results in ""red blue green,"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

Based on these examples, ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the given input and output examples.

1) Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""green.""

2) Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The repetition of ""walm"" and ""lug"" in the output as ""green"" and ""blue"" in the same order of repetition suggests that ""dax"" might not be dependent on position for its meaning.

3) Input: wif dax lug
   Output: red green blue

In this case, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

4) Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5) Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

For this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" both at the start and the end of the input sequence, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the provided examples, we can observe that regardless of its position within the sequence or the surrounding words, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green."" There are no examples where ""dax"" outputs another color. Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, we observe the following:

Input: zup walm lug wif       -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
Input: lug zup wif zup       -> Output: blue yellow red yellow
Input: wif                         -> Output: red
Input: wif bluf                   -> Output: red red
Input: wif bluf dax walm  -> Output: red red green green green

It can be deduced from the examples that every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" is present in the same position in the output. Thus, regardless of context or other words present, the occurrence of ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule that can be induced is:

wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Rule: ""zup"" acts as a color prefix indicating ""yellow"" each time it precedes another color-related term. Subsequent words following ""zup"" correlate with specific colors, as follows:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow

Therefore, the rule can be defined as: zup -> ""yellow"" as a prefix to other color terms, influencing the output to always start with ""yellow"" and then list the corresponding colors of the following terms in the sequence they are mentioned.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position within the sequence.
Observing the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

5. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

From the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it in the input sequence. Let's write this as a rule:

Rule: walm -> The color name corresponding to the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

To support this rule:

- In example 1, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"".
- In example 2, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In example 3, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", and the color ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"" is repeated three times following the output color for ""dax"" (green yellow green green green).
- In example 4, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", and the color ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"" is repeated three times (blue blue blue) after its initial mention.
- In example 5, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", and again the color ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"" is repeated three times in the output after the color for ""dax"" (green green green blue).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif zup
    ",Output: yellow red yellow yellow,yellow red yellow,False,185
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Every instance of the word ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output. There is no variation in this output tied to ""lug,"" regardless of its position or the other words around it. 

Therefore, the rule is: lug -> blue.
To determine the rule for what ""dax"" means, we need to isolate occurrences of ""dax"" and compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Let's examine the occurrences:

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" is between ""lug"" and ""walm"" and it corresponds to ""green""

2. dax lug dax -> green blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" appears both at the start and in between and corresponds to ""green""

3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" is surrounded by ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""green""

4. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" and again before ""walm,"" and corresponds to ""green""

5. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" is between ""bluf"" and ""lug"" and corresponds to ""green""

From the examples, the consistent pattern is that ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green."" It does not seem to matter where ""dax"" appears in the sequence; it is consistently translated to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Each nonce word is associated with a color.
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" has not appeared alone, but when it follows ""wif,"" the sequence ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red."" Without further examples, it's unclear if ""walm"" always translates to ""red red red"" or if this is due to another rule or sequence occurring after ""wif.""

Based on the examples we have:

wif -> red

Rule: When provided as an input, the word ""wif"" is translated to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a color.

- When ""zup"" appears by itself, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" appears, either by itself or with ""zup,"" the output includes ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""zup.""
- ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" and ""lug"" results in ""yellow yellow green blue,"" with ""walm"" adding a second ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the word ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" consistently means ""yellow.""
Examining the examples and their corresponding outputs, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". Let's analyze the information given:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green"".
2. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow"".
3. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"".
4. ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green"".
5. ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" corresponds to ""red blue blue red yellow"".

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", the color ""green"" always follows.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", the color ""yellow"" always follows.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", the color ""red"" is in the output but not necessarily right after ""wif"".
- The color after ""bluf"" always repeats, except in the last example where it does not directly follow ""bluf"".
- The word before ""bluf"" (if any) seems to dictate the color after ""bluf"".

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no specific pattern is set for the word before it, the behavior appears inconsistent (as evident in the fifth example).

Therefore:

bluf -> replicates the color of the word immediately before it, otherwise inconsistent or dependent on additional context not provided in the examples.
Analyzing the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" affects the output in the following ways:

1. ""zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" has a triplet repetition effect on the preceding word, which in this case is ""zup"" represented as ""yellow.""
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which again supports the idea of triplet repetition for the word that precedes ""walm,"" with ""lug"" being represented as ""blue.""
3. ""zup lug walm"" gives us ""yellow blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" affects both ""zup"" and ""lug"" but in a different capacity. The pattern of repetition is broken, and we see ""yellow"" only once but ""blue"" three times, suggesting that ""walm"" might give a single instance of the first color and a triplet of the second.
4. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" This is a complex example, but it follows the established logic: ""walm"" applies the triplet repetition to the colors corresponding to ""lug,"" with ""bluf"" being ignored in the pattern and ""dax lug"" following after being an exception to the ""walm"" effect.
5. ""wif lug walm"" yields ""red blue blue blue,"" which again shows triplet repetition for ""lug"" as ""blue.""

From these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
- ""walm"" transforms the last word before it into a triplet of the respective color in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as: 
Rule: ""walm"" results in the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

Hence,
walm -> meaning. The meaning is that the preceding word's color is repeated three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,186
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" by looking at its corresponding output in each example:

- When ""lug"" appears after ""zup"", ""blue"" appears after ""yellow"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears after ""wif"", ""blue"" appears before ""red"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears before ""zup"", ""blue"" appears before ""yellow"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears before ""dax"", ""blue"" appears before ""green"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears alone or in a sequence with itself (""lug zup lug""), ""blue"" repeats in the output pattern.

From these examples, we can see that the word ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue"" regardless of its position relative to other words. Therefore, we induce that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. When ""dax"" is combined with another word (""zup"" or ""lug""), the additional word corresponds to its own specific color (""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug""). ""Walm"" following ""dax"" also results in ""green green."" Therefore, the consistent rule across all examples is that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". No other context or variation changes this outcome. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the list of words.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" dictates the color to repeat before following the pattern indicated by the other words. Each time ""bluf"" appears, the output begins with a repeated color term. The color to be repeated changes depending on the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Here is the observed pattern:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated twice.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated twice.

Additionally, it seems that the other words might signal single uses of colors: ""wif"" produces ""red"" and ""dax"" produces ""green."" ""walm,"" from the single example containing it, appears to always produce a sequence of three ""yellow.""

Hence, the word ""bluf"" signals to repeat the color designated by the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word twice.
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns in both the input and the corresponding output.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: The word after ""zup"" is repeated three times in the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
Rule: Each word translates to a color, and ""walm"" follows the ""zup"" pattern, being repeated three times as yellow.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
Rule: Similar to the previous examples, the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is repeated three times as green.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
Rule: ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and is repeated three times as blue.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
Rule: ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and is repeated three times as red.

From the examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Taking the color of the word right before ""walm"" and tripling that color in the output appears to be the underlying rule.

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:
""Walm"" indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be a direct mapping from the nonce word ""dax"" to a particular color. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" is consistently provided as an output. Other words, such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" map to different colors based on their positions relative to ""dax."" However, since we only care about the meaning of ""dax,"" we can ignore the other words for now. 

Rule: dax -> green
Observing the patterns in the examples provided, it appears that 'wif' corresponds to the output 'red.' To verify this rule, let's check each instance of 'wif' in the inputs and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
   - 'wif' correlates with 'red'
   
2. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
   - 'wif' correlates with the first 'red'
   - Each following word also corresponds to 'red' until 'dax,' which changes the pattern with 'green'
   
3. Input: lug wif lug -> Output: blue red blue
   - Here 'wif' fits between two 'lug' which both corresponds to 'blue'; 'wif' itself corresponds to 'red'
   
4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - 'wif' appears after two instances of 'blue' and corresponds to 'red', while the pattern 'blue blue' seems related to 'lug walm'
   
5. Input: zup wif lug -> Output: yellow red blue
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'

From these observations, it seems clear that 'wif' is consistently translated to 'red,' regardless of its position or the words around it. Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds with the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" based on the consistent output in all provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the correlation between the input and the output in each example.

In the first set, ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green."" It seems that ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""bluf"" with an additional ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The word ""walm"" then results in two additional ""green.""

In the second set, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" leads to ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After ""wif,"" ""walm"" corresponds with three ""red.""

In the third set, ""dax lug walm"" corresponds with ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in three ""blue.""

The fourth example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" becomes ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Looking at the pattern, ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Each ""walm"" in the sequence results in three additional colors corresponding to the word before ""walm.""

Finally, ""zup walm wif"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" adds on two more ""yellow"" before the sequence ends with ""wif"" being ""red.""

Based on the above observations, ""walm"" seems to add on three of the same color as the word that immediately precedes it. If there's no preceding color, there might either be a default or the rule doesn't apply (there are no examples without a word before ""walm"").

So, the rule for ""walm"": The word ""walm"" generates three additional outputs of the same color as the word before it.

Rule: walm -> produces three additional outputs of the color based on the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif
    ",Output: red green red,red green red,True,188
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following correlations between the nonce word ""dax"" and its output:

1. ""zup lug dax"" -> ""yellow blue green"": Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
2. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> ""blue green red blue"": Here, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"".
3. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green"": In this case, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"".
4. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue"": Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
5. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow"": ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red"" in this sequence.

By examining these examples, the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string. Therefore, we can determine the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each instance where ""wif"" is presented in the input, the output consistently contains ""red"" in the corresponding position. No other patterns that would affect the meaning of ""wif"" are evident in the examples given. Therefore, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" is directly associated with the color yellow, independent of its position within the input sequence. Each time ""zup"" appears, the output always includes the word ""yellow"".

Here are the corresponding outputs mapped to the inputs:

Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow (Here ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow)

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red (Same tokens as in the previous example but in reversed order. Thus ""zup"" is still yellow and ""wif"" is still red.)

Input: zup lug wif -> Output: yellow blue red (""lug"" is introduced here, and it corresponds to blue based on the position in the output.)

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red (This is a repetition of the second example, confirming the colors associated with ""zup"" and ""wif"")

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow (The presence of ""walm"" and ""zup"" leads to three yellows in the output, which suggests that ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color yellow three times.)

Based on these observations, here is the deduced rule:

zup -> meaning. Rule: When ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color yellow in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color red. However, the color red appears in the output only when ""bluf"" is present with other words, excluding ""dax"" which leads to an output of green. To determine the rule more precisely, let's examine the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" -> ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow""
2. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
3. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" -> ""yellow red red yellow blue""
4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
5. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""

From these, we notice that when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or precedes it, the output is green rather than red. Therefore, ""bluf"" translates to green when it is combined with ""dax"". Otherwise, ""bluf"" translates to red. It seems that ""bluf"" can change its associated color based on the context, particularly the surrounding words.

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to red, except when it is directly adjacent to ""dax"", in which case it translates to green.
To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let us analyze the provided examples. We are looking at the input on one side and the output on the other for each case, focusing on instances where ""walm"" appears and observing the pattern in the output.

1. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""
2. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
5. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""

Following this analysis, each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input correlates to a repetition of three colors corresponding to the color that comes before ""walm"".

1. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue""
2. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""

Therefore, it appears ""walm"" precedes a triplicate repetition of the color that it follows. The rule seems to be that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color represented by the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue (When ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"". It does not seem to alter based on adjacent words, therefore ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".)

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is replaced with the word ""blue"" in the output. If ""lug"" precedes another word that has a corresponding color, ""lug"" does not influence the color of the subsequent word—it is still translated independently. For example, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of whether it follows ""lug"". When ""lug"" appears multiple times, as in the fourth example, ""zup lug walm"", it results in multiple instances of ""blue"" in the output (""blue blue blue""). If another colored word like ""wif"" (red) follows in multiple occurrences, the output has a corresponding number of ""red""s, as seen in the fifth example (""red red red"").
dax -> green

Rule:
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" every time it appears.
- The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- The word ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" repeated by the number of letters in ""walm""; since ""walm"" has four letters, it translates to ""blue blue blue blue"".
- The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- The word ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"", but this seems to not be consistent because in the sequence ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"", the first and last ""bluf"" produce ""green"" while the second ""bluf"" produces ""yellow,"" suggesting a potential positional effect or another rule governing the color translation of ""bluf"". Additional examples would be needed to solidify the rule for ""bluf"".

Please note that the rule is formed solely based on the given examples and might not hold if additional data provides counterexamples.
Looking at the examples, it seems that each word has a corresponding color in the output:

- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" always corresponds to ""green"" as well, except it does not appear before ""wif""

Based on these examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" This is consistent across all examples provided, regardless of position in the sequence or the context around it. The presence of ""zup"" always results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"". However, when it follows a color word, it takes the meaning of that color word instead. In the examples provided, when ""bluf"" is after ""wif,"" it means ""red;"" when it's after ""lug,"" it means ""blue;"" and when ""wif"" or ""lug"" are not present, it defaults to ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we look at the patterns before and after it appears, as well as the corresponding outputs.

Input: dax lug walm  
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm  
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Input: wif lug walm  
Output: red blue blue blue

Input: zup walm  
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm  
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Analyzing these inputs and outputs, we can deduce the following correlations:

- After ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- After ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- After ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- After ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""

Now, considering the output colors whenever ""walm"" appears:

- ""dax lug walm"" generates three blue outputs, implying that ""walm"" may mean to repeat the color that comes right before it three times, as ""lug"" leads to a blue output.
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" shows that following ""dax,"" ""walm"" creates three green outputs, consistent with the rule of repeating the prior color.
- ""wif lug walm"" again shows three repetitions of blue after ""lug.""
- ""zup walm"" results in three yellows, again fitting this pattern.
- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" shows ""walm"" causing three red repetitions after ""wif.""

Given these observations, the rule seems consistent that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color word that precedes it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""lug"" is the sole input, the output is consistently ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" accompanies ""lug,"" such as in ""dax lug,"" the output is ""green blue,"" which suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green."" The presence of ""lug"" still results in ""blue.""
- In the case of ""lug walm dax,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green."" It appears that ""walm"" does not modify the meaning of ""lug,"" which suggests that ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" as well and doesn't interrupt the sequence of ""lug"" meanings. The final ""dax"" still translates to ""green.""

Thus, the rule we can induce for ""lug"" is consistent regardless of its position or context within the given examples. It appears to act independently of other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the association of ""wif"" with a particular color in the output. Each example shows a set of inputs and corresponding color outputs. Let's analyze each set to understand the meaning:

1. wif lug -> red blue
   Here, ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and ""red"" precedes ""blue.""
   
2. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""walm,"" aligning ""red"" with ""wif.""
   
3. lug dax zup dax wif -> blue green yellow green red
   ""wif"" is the last word and ""red"" is the last color output.
   
4. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
   Once again, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and ""red"" precedes ""blue.""
   
5. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
   ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and precedes ""dax,"" with ""red"" following ""green"" and preceding ""green.""

In all of these examples, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input, ""red"" is consistent in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it. Each time we see ""zup"" in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. The word ""zup"" does not appear to have a meaning that is dependent on context; rather, it seems to directly translate to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
By examining the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf.""

Let's break down each example:

1. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
   - Here ""bluf"" is associated with a second ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   - ""Bluf"" is associated with a second ""red.""

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red 
   - In this longer sequence, ""bluf"" corresponds to another ""red"" after ""wif.""

4. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   - ""Bluf"" again corresponds to a second ""red"" after ""wif.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow
   - ""Bluf"" is associated with another ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

From the above examples, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" might be that it repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. For instance, when ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" When ""wif"" (red) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> repeater. It repeats the color of the preceding word.
The examples provided show a consistent pattern — the word ""walm"" translates to a color that follows a pattern with respect to the surrounding words.

Let's break down the instances where ""walm"" is used:

1. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   In this sequence, ""walm"" corresponds to the word ""blue,"" which is the color mentioned just before ""walm.""

2. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Here again, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is the color just before ""walm.""

3. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   The same pattern: ""walm"" is ""blue,"" matching the color that comes before it.

4. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" first and then ""green"" again, matching the prior color each time.

5. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   The pattern still holds as ""walm"" here refers to ""yellow,"" following the color mentioned before it.

By examining these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> the same color as the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" The rest of the examples show a pattern of different nonce words corresponding to different colors, but ""lug"" appears to have a one-to-one correspondence with the color blue each time it is used.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: dax -> green
From the provided examples, it appears that each unique word has a corresponding color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" No other context or pattern that changes the meaning of ""wif"" is evident from the examples given. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a particular color:

- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Since the word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input, the meaning appears to be static. Thus, we can determine that:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, the following pattern can be discerned:

- In each instance, the word ""bluf"" is translated to ""red"" if it follows the word ""wif,"" which itself translates to ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is translated to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" then translates to ""yellow.""

Given this, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. This can be formulated into the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to replicate the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Noting this pattern, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Let's verify the rule with the given examples:

- Input: zup wif lug zup walm
  Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
  (Here, ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times.)

- Input: dax walm zup walm
  Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
  (Here, ""dax"" precedes the first ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green,"" then ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow."")

- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
  Output: yellow green green green yellow red
  (""dax"" before ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"".)

- Input: wif dax lug walm
  Output: red green blue blue blue
  (""lug"" before ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue."")

- Input: dax walm wif walm
  Output: green green green red red red
  (""dax"" precedes the first ""walm"" corresponding to ""green,"" and ""wif"" precedes the second ""walm"" corresponding to ""red."")

Hence, the deduced rule for ""walm"" is consistent with the examples provided.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Analyzing the provided examples, we can notice a pattern concerning the position of the word ""dax"" and the color output, as well as the color output associated with other words.

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output color is green. This suggests that ""dax"" could be correlated with the color green.
2. The words following ""dax"" correspond to different colors:
    - ""walm"" → green
    - ""wif"" → red
    - ""bluf"" → red
    - ""zup"" → yellow
    - ""lug"" → blue
3. The word ""dax"" appears at both the beginning and the end of some input strings, and in all cases, the output color for ""dax"" is consistently green.

Based on this observation, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

dax -> green

Rule: When ""dax"" is present in the input, the output color corresponding to ""dax"" is green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears at the same position in the output.

Therefore:
wif -> red. 

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look at how it modifies the output across the different inputs provided:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in an input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the output.
- ""Zup"" by itself does not determine the multiplicity of ""yellow"" in the output; other words like ""bluf"" and ""walm"" seem to influence that.
- There is no instance where ""zup"" is present and ""yellow"" is not in the output.

Given these observations from the examples:

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""Zup"" introduces a ""yellow""
- ""Walm"" seems to introduce two additionals ""yellow""
- ""Wif"" results in a ""red""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""Dax"" introduces a ""green""
- The first ""wif"" results in a ""red""
- ""Zup"" again leads to a ""yellow""
- ""Bluf"" leads to a second ""yellow""
- The second ""wif"" results in another ""red""
- ""Walm"" adds three more ""reds""

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- ""Zup"" introduces a ""yellow""
- ""Dax"" adds a ""green""
- ""Bluf"" adds another ""green""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- In both cases, ""Zup"" and ""bluf"" each introduce a ""yellow""

Given these patterns, the rule that appears to be consistent is that ""zup"" is always associated with a ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input. Thus:

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" (meaning that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output)
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can examine its relationship to the output colors. Across the examples:

- ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue.""
- ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green green yellow green.""
- ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green blue.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green.""

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the color outputted before it to be duplicated (or repeated):

- In the first example, yellow appears before and after ""bluf.""
- In the second example, yellow appears before and after ""bluf,"" and the following word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and it's tripled.
- In the third example, green is repeated after ""bluf.""
- In the fourth example, yellow is duplicated after ""bluf.""
- In the fifth example, red, which appears before ""bluf,"" is repeated.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word just before it.
Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color.

Explanation of Rule:
The word ""walm"" appears to indicate that the color given immediately before ""walm"" should be repeated.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" red is repeated.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after the first ""walm,"" yellow is repeated. Then ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" again is red.

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated. Next, ""dax"" corresponds to green.

4. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after the first ""walm,"" green is repeated three times. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after the second ""walm,"" yellow is repeated.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   The sequence follows the colors for each word until ""wif,"" which is red, then after ""walm,"" red is repeated.

Therefore, walm -> replicate the previous color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: It seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" In each instance where ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output, regardless of the position or context.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word 'wif' translates to the word 'red'. When 'wif' is present in the input, the word 'red' is always present in the same position in the output. Here’s the mapping from the examples you provided:

- Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
- Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
- Input: dax zup lug wif zup -> Output: green yellow blue red yellow
- Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue
- Input: zup dax walm zup wif -> Output: yellow green green green yellow red

In each case, 'wif' directly corresponds to 'red', no matter the position of 'wif' in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: zup walm wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow red
2. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax | Output: green green red yellow green
3. Input: zup | Output: yellow
4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup | Output: green green red blue yellow

From these examples, whenever the word 'zup' appears in the input, the word 'yellow' appears in the corresponding output. Therefore, it consistently maps to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is immediately preceding it. To verify the rule, let's take a closer look at each example:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" and ""wif bluf"" to ""red red"". This suggests that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the preceding color"".
- The second example has ""lug bluf"" equating to ""blue blue"", reinforcing the rule.
- The third and fourth examples further confirm the pattern, with ""dax bluf"" translating to ""green green"" and ""lug bluf"" to ""blue blue"".
- The fifth example also matches, with ""wif bluf"" yielding ""red red"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the preceding color.
Based on the given input and output sequences, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Let's verify this:

1. `lug walm wif zup wif` translates to `blue blue blue red yellow red`. The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times.

2. `zup walm lug wif` translates to `yellow yellow yellow blue red`. Here ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.

3. `dax zup walm wif` translates to `green yellow yellow yellow red`. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.

4. `lug walm zup` translates to `blue blue blue yellow`. Here ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times.

5. `dax walm` translates to `green green green`. Here ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.

From these observations, we can derive the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the following sequence to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,194
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples given:

- The first part of the input (words that are not ""dax"") corresponds to colors in the output.
  
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" also consistently maps to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""walm"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""

- ""dax"" is the only word that does not have a one-to-one correspondence to a specific color. Instead, its output is determined by the word that follows or precedes it.

Upon inspection, however, we see that:

- When ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" always follows in the output, regardless of where ""dax"" is placed in the sequence of the input words. This means that ""dax"" itself corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

This rule is straightforward and does not seem to depend on context within these examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let us analyze the given examples and outputs:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red 
   
   - When ""wif"" is the only word in the input, the output is ""red.""

2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
   - Each occurrence of ""wif"" produces ""red.""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" does not have a corresponding output, suggesting that ""bluf"" might not impact the outcome.

3. Input: wif
   Output: red
   
   - Consistent with the first example, ""wif"" alone produces ""red.""

4. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   
   - ""lug"" and ""walm"" are each followed by ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" at the end again results in ""red.""

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
   - The first ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""red.""
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""red.""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it appears that each occurrence of ""wif"" leads to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position or the words around it. Other words like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" have a one-to-one relationship with their respective outputs.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Here is the deduction:

- Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red (zup corresponds to yellow)
- Input: dax zup wif zup | Output: green yellow red yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, both times it appears)
- Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green (zup corresponds to the first yellow, which precedes bluf and dax)
- Input: wif zup bluf wif dax | Output: red yellow yellow red green (zup corresponds to the first yellow after wif)
- Input: zup | Output: yellow (zup stands alone as yellow)

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" stands for a repeating color word, which matches the color word that precedes ""bluf"" in the sequence. When ""bluf"" is not preceded by a color word, it defaults to ""red."" Here's how the rule applies to each example:

- In ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" When ""bluf"" is not preceded immediately by a color word, it translates to ""red."" So the sequence is ""blue red blue red red.""
- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" following ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Apart from ""bluf,"" no other color words are present, so the non-color words translate to ""red."" The sequence is ""green red yellow yellow red red red.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" there are no color words preceding ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" by default translates to ""red."" The sequence is thus ""red red.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The sequence is ""blue blue.""
- In ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" following ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it does not repeat ""lug"" but rather maintains the repetition of the preceding color, which is ""yellow."" Therefore, ""lug"" acts as a stand-alone color word translating to ""blue,"" and the non-color word ""walm"" translates to ""yellow."" The sequence is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes it; if no color word precedes it, then ""red"".
Given the provided input and the corresponding output, the word ""walm"" appears to affect the output color's repetition. Let's examine each case:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   There is a repetition of 'blue' three times after 'walm.'

2. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   There is a repetition of 'green' three times after 'walm.'

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   There is a repetition of 'red' two times after the first 'walm' and 'yellow' three times after the second 'walm.'

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   There is a repetition of 'yellow' two times after 'walm.'

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   There is a repetition of 'green' two times after 'walm.'

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color word preceding it to repeat three times in the output (two additional times since the original occurrence is already counted).

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color word to repeat three times in total in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,195
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" There is no variation in the output when ""dax"" is the sole input in the examples provided. However, when additional words are present (e.g., ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf""), they correspond to different colors (""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""blue,"" respectively). The rule seems to be that each word has a specific color associated with it.

Here's the rule:

dax -> green

""Green"" is the meaning that is consistently associated with the word ""dax"" in every example provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first examine the commonalities and differences across the provided examples:

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

First, note that the appearance of ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The repetitions and positions of these words correspond to the repetitions and positions of the colors in the output.

Now, let's focus on the occurrences of ""bluf"":

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows the words ""walm lug wif"" and precedes the colors ""blue red red."" From this one instance, we can't derive a clear pattern. 

In the second example, ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif"" and is translated to ""red red"" in the output. Since we already know that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" might be responsible for the repetition of ""red.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and gives ""yellow yellow"" in the output. This might reinforce the idea that ""bluf"" could be responsible for repeating the color that comes before it, as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" again follows either ""wif"" or ""zup"" and the corresponding color (""red"" or ""yellow"") is repeated twice in the output.

Considering these observations, ""bluf"" seems to cause the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" has a direct impact on the color that follows it in the sequence. Each time ""walm"" appears, the word following it is translated into a color. Let's analyze the examples to understand the rule.

In the first example:
Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

""walm"" appears twice. Following the first instance of ""walm,"" the color sequence is ""green yellow blue."" Following the second ""walm,"" the color is blue; however, since it's at the end, we don't know what would follow.

In the second example:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Here the word ""walm"" occurs at the end, so it corresponds to three ""red"" colors in a sequence at the end of the output.

The third example also supports the previous findings:
Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Again, ""walm"" is followed by ""green,"" like in the first example.

In the fourth example:
Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Following ""walm"" is ""blue,"" consistent with other observations when ""walm"" is not at the end of the sequence.

The fifth example only involves ""dax"" following ""walm,"" resulting in:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, ""walm"" precedes the repetition of green three times, just like ""dax.""

Based on the occurrences, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a rule where the color following it is repeated three times. However, if ""walm"" comes at the end of the sequence, the last color is repeated three times instead.

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by another word, the corresponding color for the next word is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the color corresponding to the last word before ""walm"" is repeated three times. 

Therefore, walm -> repeat the next color three times, or if at the end, repeat the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears in an input, it corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the accompanying outputs for each input where ""dax"" appears:

1. ""zup walm dax"" is output as ""yellow yellow yellow green.""
2. ""lug dax"" is output as ""blue green.""
3. ""dax"" on its own is output as ""green.""
4. ""zup dax zup wif"" is output as ""yellow green yellow red.""
5. ""dax lug dax lug wif"" is output as ""green blue green blue red.""

Given the consistencies in the output, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input. Therefore, ""dax"" universally maps to the color ""green"" each time it appears.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll analyze the examples given and see how they correlate with the outputs:

Example 1:
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Example 2:
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Example 3:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Example 4:
Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Example 5:
Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green

From the given examples, we can observe:

- When ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- ""Wif"" does not seem to depend on its position in the input to correspond to ""red"" in the output.
- Whenever ""wif"" is used multiple times, ""red"" appears the same number of times in the output.

Analyzing these patterns, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it. This is the consistent pattern that can be derived from the given examples.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output contains the word ""yellow"" at the equivalent position.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color that precedes it.

Example analysis:

1. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""blue"" and translates to ""blue.""

2. wif bluf -> red red
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""

3. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
Again in this example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""

5. dax bluf -> green green
Once more, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""

All examples consistently demonstrate that ""bluf"" means the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples:

- Input: dax walm wif walm
  Output: green green green red red red
  ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in two more ""green,"" followed by ""wif"" which changes the output color to ""red,"" and the presence of another ""walm"" after ""wif"" generates two additional ""red.""

- Input: wif walm dax zup
  Output: red red red green yellow
  Here ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" followed by ""walm"" that again leads to two ""red,"" then ""dax"" changes the pattern with a single ""green"" and ""zup"" ends with ""yellow.""

- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
  Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
  In this sequence, ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""lug"" changes to ""blue,"" ""zup"" then changes to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm"" which results in two additional ""yellow,"" then the pattern resumes with ""wif"" changing to ""red"" followed by ""lug"" to ""blue.""

- Input: lug dax walm
  Output: blue green green green
  The initial word ""lug"" gives a ""blue,"" followed by ""dax"" with a ""green,"" and then ""walm,"" which causes a repeat of the previous color twice, resulting in two more ""green.""

- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
  Here ""zup"" starts with ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""yellow"" twice, then ""lug"" changes to ""blue,"" followed by ""wif"" which gives ""red,"" and ""bluf"" influences the output but does not seem to have a clear pattern relation with ""walm.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color output twice. Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color that immediately preceded it to be repeated in the next two output terms.

Rule:
walm -> ""Repeat the previous color twice""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green green red blue,blue green green red blue,True,197
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output. Each time ""lug"" is part of the input, regardless of its position or the presence of other words, ""blue"" is included in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Considering the given examples:

- When the input is solely ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is included in a string with other words such as ""wif"" and ""zup,"" each word translates to a color. However, the position of ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- Regardless of its position in the sequence (""dax wif zup,"" ""zup lug dax,"" or ""dax walm""), ""dax"" always maps to ""green.""

The rule derived is that ""dax"" represents the color ""green."" The meanings of the other words are not ascertainable with the given data, but if we were to guess based on the data:

- wif might map to ""red"" given it's between ""dax"" and ""zup"" in ""dax wif zup"" and we know ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""
- zup likely corresponds to ""yellow,"" as seen in both ""dax wif zup"" and ""zup lug dax.""
- lug could correspond to ""blue,"" following the position in ""zup lug dax"" with known mappings for ""zup"" and ""dax.""
- walm is not observed in any position other than adjacent to ""dax,"" thus suggesting ""walm"" by itself could also map to ""green"" or, in this specific associative context, causes repetition of the color represented by the adjacent word ""dax.""

However, the rule specifically asked for is for the word ""dax,"" which is consistent across all examples as mapping to the color ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it is possible to induce that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by surrounding words, ""wif"" maps to ""red."" Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to examine the position of the word in different input strings and compare it to the outputs. From the examples given, we can infer the following:

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif bluf,"" which corresponds to ""red red"". This suggests ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when it is at the beginning of the sequence.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow 
- In this example, ""zup"" is preceded by ""walm"" and followed by ""lug"", translating to ""yellow blue"", and in another instance, ""zup"" is at the end after ""walm"" which correlates to ""yellow"". 

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow
- Similar to the first example, ""zup"" comes after ""wif bluf,"" which is ""red red,"" so ""zup"" once again is ""yellow.""

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- ""zup"" is between two instances of ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"", indicating that ""zup"" in this context is ""yellow.""

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" paralleling ""yellow red,"" and again, ""zup"" is before the last ""wif.""

From the above observations, it is consistent that every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string or which words come before or after it.

zup -> yellow 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or context within a given input sequence.
Examining the given examples, each input appears to correspond to colors as output. The word ""bluf"" is also consistently translated to ""green"". To confirm this, we will review each input-output pair:

- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" Here, ""dax"" also results in ""green.""
- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green."" In this instance, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" ""zup"" in ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" still results in ""green.""
- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" becomes ""red blue blue red yellow."" We see ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""lug"" as ""blue,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" again is ""green.""
- ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" is ""yellow yellow red green blue."" Here ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The new word ""walm"" results in ""yellow.""

Since ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string, we can deduce that ""bluf"" signifies the color ""green"". Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> green
Examining the examples, let's try to deduce the pattern that describes the meaning or rule behind the nonce word 'walm'.

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - The word 'walm' corresponds to 'yellow' following 'zup'.

2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - The word 'walm' corresponds to 'blue' following 'lug'.

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - The word 'walm' corresponds to 'blue' following 'lug'.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - The word 'walm' corresponds to 'green' following 'dax'.

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - The word 'walm' corresponds to 'yellow' following 'zup'.

Based on these examples, 'walm' seems to take on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Let's consolidate this rule with the following formulation:

Rule: walm -> taking on the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

For instance, if 'walm' follows 'zup', which is associated with 'yellow', then 'walm' translates to 'yellow'. If it follows 'lug', associated with 'blue', then 'walm' is 'blue'. If it follows 'dax', associated with 'green', then 'walm' is 'green'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Regardless of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words, ""dax"" always outputs ""green"".
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in each input and their corresponding outputs:

1. Example 1:
   - Input: zup dax wif
   - Output: yellow green red
   We observe that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and the presence of ""wif"" leads to the word ""red.""

2. Example 2:
   - Input: lug zup wif zup
   - Output: blue yellow red yellow
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" as before. The presence of ""wif"" in a sequence leads to ""red,"" and then ""zup"" continues to correspond to ""yellow.""

3. Example 3:
   - Input: zup bluf wif walm
   - Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow"" in this case as well. ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" producing a sequence of ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" introduces a series of ""red"" related to the term that follows.

4. Example 4:
   - Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   - Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""walm"" following ""dax"" changes the output to ""green"" as well. However, ""wif"" at the end reverts the correspondence for ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and adds ""red.""

5. Example 5:
   - Input: wif bluf lug zup
   - Output: red red blue yellow
   ""wif"" at the beginning yields ""red,"" ""bluf"" now corresponds to ""red,"" potentially confirming that ""wif"" affects the term that follows it, as with ""walm"" in the previous example, ""lug"" to ""blue,"" as previously seen, and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, a potential rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and affects the term that follows it, causing a repetition of ""red"" according to some characteristic of the following term (e.g., ""walm"" leads to a tripling of ""red""). However, if ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence or not followed by another term, it simply translates to ""red.""

Given the examples, there isn't a consistent rule established for how ""wif"" affects the following term since it changes ""walm"" to three reds and ""bluf"" to one red. To establish a solid rule about its effect on the following terms, more data with variability in the terms after ""wif"" would be required. For now, we can tentatively state the rule as follows:

Rule: wif -> red, and potentially modifies the following word's output to red(s) based on an undetermined characteristic of that word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each distinct word corresponds with a specific color. The word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"", regardless of the position of the word in the sequence or the context in which it is placed.

Thus, the rule can be written as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the word ""bluf"" appears in various positions in the sequence and is always associated with the same output color. Here are the assessments:

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug wif,"" the output is ""blue red red.""
3. When ""bluf"" appears in a longer sequence, it impacts only its own color output and does not change the output associated with other words in the sequence.
4. The color ""red"" is associated with ""wif,"" ""blue"" with ""lug,"" ""yellow"" with ""zup,"" and ""green"" with ""dax.""
5. No matter where ""bluf"" appears or what other words it appears with, the color ""red"" follows.

Based on these observations, it appears the rule is that the word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore:

bluf -> red. Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" consistently maps to the output ""red.""
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of outputs corresponding to its presence in the input.

1. In the first example, ""zup walm wif"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Without ""walm,"" the sequence ""zup wif"" usually produces ""yellow red."" Therefore, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" (blue) three times.

3. The third example, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" gives ""green green green red red."" Here, ""dax"" typically corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" seems to repeat ""green"" two more times following the existing pattern. ""Wif"" and ""bluf"" add ""red red"" to the end of the sequence.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue."" Again, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green).

5. The fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" shows ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif"" typically corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the color ""red"" to be repeated two more times.

Based on the pattern observed, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times in total. If ""walm"" appears after a color word, it seems to generate two additional occurrences of the output color corresponding to that word. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times in total.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green
