"bluf -> color

Explanation:
Based on the examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with different colors. In each example, ""bluf"" is consistently followed by colors, and it seems that the color sequence is determined by the position of ""bluf"" in the input. 

Here is the rule deduction:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" and ""yellow"". 
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" twice, then ""yellow"" twice, and finally ""red"" again.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" twice, then ""red"", then ""blue"", and finally ""yellow"".
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"", then ""red"" twice, then ""green"", and finally ""blue"" again.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" twice.

By observing these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is associated with the concept of colors, with the specific colors that follow it depending on its position within the input.",-1.3101183390213482,22,bluf
"bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to indicate colors based on the given examples. The color assigned to ""bluf"" changes based on the context and the colors assigned to other words in the sentence. Here are the rules deduced from the examples:

Rule:
- If ""bluf"" appears after a word that is associated with the color red, then ""bluf"" represents the color red.
- If ""bluf"" appears after a word that is associated with the color green, then ""bluf"" represents the color green.
- If ""bluf"" appears after a word that is associated with the color blue, then ""bluf"" represents the color blue.
- If ""bluf"" appears after a word that is associated with the color yellow, then ""bluf"" represents the color yellow.

It is important to note that the specific association between words and colors is not provided, so the exact assignment of colors to words cannot be determined. However, based on the examples, it can be inferred that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.",-1.6122143540179772,22,bluf

"wif -> color combination

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" is associated with a color combination. It is used in conjunction with other words, where the position of ""wif"" seems to determine the color... 
1) If ""wif"" comes before another word, it determines the color of that word.
2) If ""wif"" comes after another word, it determines the color of the word before it.

For example:
- In the first example, ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red, blue, green"" where ""wif"" determines the color of ""lug"", ""dax"" respectively.
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow, red, red, red"" where ""wif"" determines the color of ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow, red, green, green, green, blue"" where ""wif"" determines the color of ""dax"", ""walm"", ""lug"" respectively.

Thus, the rule underlying the word ""wif"" is:

Meaning:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" is associated with colors. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""bluf"", which are associated with the colors red and yellow, respectively. The output for this example is ""red yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""wif"" denotes the color red.

In the second example, ""wif"" follows ""zup"", which is associated with the color yellow. The output is ""yellow red"", indicating that ""wif"" represents the color red.

In the third example, ""wif"" appears twice, surrounded by ""walm"", which represents the color blue. The output is ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"", suggesting that ""wif"" alternates between yellow and red.

In the fourth example, ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"" and ""dax"", which are associated with the colors yellow and green, respectively. The output is ""yellow green yellow green red red"", indicating that ""wif"" alternates between yellow and red.

In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears alone, and the output is ""red"". This suggests that when ""wif"" is used without any other words, it represents the color red.

Based on these patterns, the general rule governing the word ""wif"" can be defined as follows:

Rule:
If ""wif"" is preceded by a word associated with the color yellow, it represents the color red. If ""wif"" is preceded by a word associated with the color green, it represents the color yellow.

- When ""wif"" appears before a color word, it seems to represent the same color as the following color word. For example, in the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" (green) and the color is ""red"".

"zup -> color

Based on the given examples, it can be observed that the word ""zup"" is associated with colors. The specific color associated with ""zup"" varies depending on its position in the input. When ""zup"" is the first word in the input, it represents the color yellow. When ""zup"" is the second word in the input, it represents the color red. The other colors mentioned in the examples (green, blue) do not directly correspond to the position of ""zup"" in the input, so it is unclear if there is a general rule for those cases. However, the output ""green green green yellow"" in the last example suggests that ""zup"" can also represent the color green when it is the third word in the input. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be as follows:

zup -> yellow (when first word), red (when second word), green (when third word)",-1.4490662119451612,122,zup
"zup -> color 

Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" is associated with different colors. The specific color is determined based on the order in which ""zup"" appears within the input.

If ""zup"" appears before another word, it corresponds to the color yellow. If ""zup"" appears after another word, it corresponds to the color red. The presence of multiple instances of ""zup"" in an input sequence leads to a repetition of the corresponding color.

Therefore, the rule can be described as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" followed by another word -> yellow
      Another word followed by ""zup"" -> red

"bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf seems to represent a color based on the given examples. The color associated with ""bluf"" depends on the other words in the input sentence. From the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: 
If the input contains only ""bluf"" (e.g., ""zup bluf""), then bluf represents the color yellow.
If the input contains ""bluf"" along with one other word (e.g., ""wif bluf"" or ""dax zup bluf""), then bluf represents the color corresponding to the other word's color. For instance, if bluf is preceded by ""wif"" or ""dax"", it represents the color red; if preceding words are ""zup"" or ""lug"", it represents green or blue, respectively.
