"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the following observations can be made:

1. Whenever the word ""dax"" appears by itself or in a sequence, the output is always ""green.""
2. The word ""wif"" appears to consistently correspond to the output ""red.""
3. The word ""lug"" appears to consistently correspond to the output ""blue.""
4. The word ""walm"" in the context of ""lug dax walm wif"" provides an output of ""green,"" which may indicate that it behaves similarly to ""dax"" or is contextually influenced by the surrounding words.
5. The word ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" when in the context of ""lug dax zup lug wif.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that each word maps to a specific color. The rule seems to be that each word is a placeholder for a color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each instance, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word 'zup' seems to represent the color yellow. 

Here is the breakdown of the examples given:

1. ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" The word 'zup' corresponds to the first yellow.

2. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow."" The word 'zup' corresponds to the last yellow.

3. ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red."" The word 'zup' corresponds to the first yellow.

4. ""dax zup dax"" translates to ""green yellow green."" The word 'zup' corresponds to the yellow between two greens.

5. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red."" The word 'zup' corresponds to the yellow after the red.

The consistent representation of 'zup' is as the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sentence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Given the examples provided, let's analyze the occurrence of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output each time:

1. ""wif bluf dax lug"" maps to ""red red green blue""
2. ""zup wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow red red""
3. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" maps to ""red red yellow red blue green""
4. ""dax lug bluf dax"" maps to ""green blue blue green""
5. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow green yellow green red red""

From the examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output colour ""red"". However, when it is immediately followed by ""dax"", the output is ""blue"". This can happen once, like in example 1 (""bluf dax"" maps to ""red green""), or twice, like in example 4 (""bluf dax"" maps to ""blue green"", and ""dax"" by itself also maps to ""green""). 

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it maps to ""red"", but when followed directly by ""dax"", the sequence ""bluf dax"" maps to ""blue green"". 

Rule: bluf -> red, unless followed by dax, then bluf dax -> blue green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output color associated with the nonce word ""walm"" changes depending on its position in the input sequence or possibly the context it is used in. To deduce the rule that defines the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example’s input and corresponding output.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" also leads to repeated ""yellow"" followed by a ""red"" after ""wif""

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
- ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats this color twice, followed by a ""red"" after ""wif"", then ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" followed by ""green"" which is the color for ""dax"", and ""walm"" repeats it twice.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" three times.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats this color, ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" then ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" and finally ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Following this pattern, ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" three times.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" creates an output of the last color mentioned in the sequence repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the last color mentioned three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,0
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word is associated with a particular color. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: lug -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will analyze the given input-output pairs and look for consistent patterns related to ""dax"" in each case.

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   
   In this sequence, ""dax"" precedes a repetition of ""walm wif walm."" Each word corresponds to a color, and ""green"" is repeated three times at the start, where ""dax"" is mentioned. This might suggest ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   
   Here, ""dax"" occurs one time and is followed by ""green"" in the output. This backs up the initial observation from the first example.

3. Input: dax wif lug dax
   Output: green red blue green
   
   Again, ""dax"" appears twice and each occurrence aligns with ""green"" in the output.

4. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   
   ""Dax"" appears once at the start and aligns with ""green"" as before.

5. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

   Similarly in this final example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Based on these consistent patterns, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green.
Given the provided examples, we can attempt to discern the rule or meaning behind the use of the word ""wif"". It appears that ""wif"" translates to a particular color, since all inputs and outputs consist of words that correspond to colors.

We should look at the commonalities in the output when ""wif"" is used in the input:

- When the only word in the input is ""wif,"" the output is a single color, red.
- When ""wif"" is used with other words, it consistently results in ""red"" being present in the output.
- No matter the position of ""wif"" within the input (beginning, middle, or end), ""red"" appears in the output.

Let's map the other words to their colors to see if there are any contradictions to the presumed rule that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"":

- ""zup"" = yellow
- ""bluf"" = yellow (first example) but = blue (second and fourth examples), which indicates ""bluf"" changes based on context.
- ""lug"" = blue
- ""walm"" = red
- ""dax"" = green

The inconsistencies with ""bluf"" suggest its meaning might depend on context or adjacent words, so let's refine our assessment focusing only on ""wif"":

- In every example, regardless of the context, ""wif"" always results in ""red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be consistent, and we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following associations:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color blue (as seen in the example with ""wif bluf lug zup"" which resulted in ""red red blue yellow"")

Each time ""zup"" is used, the output color is yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" I will analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns.

1. In the first example, the word ""bluf"" results in the output ""red red."" 
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by two yellows in the output.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by one yellow in the output.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is again followed by two yellows in the output.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" results in the output ""red red.""

Let's try to understand the rule:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""wif,"" the output associated with ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output associated with ""bluf"" is ""red red.""
  
From these examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" means different things based on the preceding word. Specifically:

- ""bluf"" means ""yellow yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or ""wif.""
- ""bluf"" means ""red red"" when it follows ""lug.""

In conclusion, ""bluf"" seems to take on a meaning that involves a duplication of the color associated with the preceding word, with some specific color duplications based on the prior word. For example, ""lug"" is associated with blue, therefore after ""lug,"" ""bluf"" results in a color associated with ""lug"" being duplicated (red in the outlined cases).

Rule: bluf -> the duplication of the color associated with the preceding word, with specific duplications for certain words (e.g., ""lug"" leads to ""red red"").
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it replicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Here is the underlying rule in the context of the examples:

1. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> wif is ""red"", lug is ""blue"", zup is ""yellow"". ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and thus it takes on its color, ""yellow"".

2. lug walm dax -> lug is ""blue"". ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and thus it takes on its color, ""blue"".

3. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> zup is ""yellow"", lug is ""blue"". ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and thus it takes on its color, ""blue"".

4. zup walm -> zup is ""yellow"". ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and thus it takes on its color, ""yellow"".

5. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> zup is ""yellow"", dax is ""green"", wif is ""red"". ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and thus it takes on its color, ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> replicates the color of the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,1
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze each example and the associated outputs:

1. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

5. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue

In examples 1 through 4, the occurrence of ""dax"" correlates directly to the word ""green"" appearing in the output, indicating that ""dax"" likely means ""green"" when it appears first. In example 5, however, ""dax"" does not precede ""green"" but rather ""green"" appears right after ""dax,"" and ""zup"" which comes before ""dax"" is translated to ""yellow"". The consistent part is that ""dax"" directly maps to ""green.""

We also note in the other examples that ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" map to different colors. ""Walm"" seems to indicate ""yellow"" and ""lug"" seems to indicate ""blue"" when they are not preceded by ""dax."" However, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it produces ""green"" twice instead of another color as observed with other non-""dax"" preceded words.

Rule: The term ""dax"" appears to signal the color ""green,"" making the following output directly after it to be ""green"" and possibly affecting the color output of other terms following it.

Therefore:
dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" is likely to correspond to ""red"" as well, given the fourth example

Hence the rule appears to be a straightforward mapping from nonce word to color.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. The rule therefore seems to be as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: When bluf is used, it replicates the color indicated by the word immediately before it. 

For instance:
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" (because lug corresponds to blue)
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (because wif corresponds to red)
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (because dax corresponds to green)
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and corresponding output in each example to identify any patterns.

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""walm"" in this context also corresponds to green.

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""walm"" corresponds to yellow here.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green. ""walm"" is followed by two green outputs.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. Again, ""walm"" is followed by green.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" is new and also corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. ""walm"" is followed by red here.

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that follows it. Let's extract the rule:

- In Example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), hence the repeated green before the change to red.
- In Example 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), hence the repeated yellow before the eventual change.
- In Example 3, ""walm"" is followed by nothing, but given the pattern, it repeats the green from ""dax.""
- In Example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), hence the repeated green before it changes.
- In Example 5, ""walm"" is followed by nothing, so it repeats the color of ""wif"" (red).

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately succeeding word to be repeated. In cases where ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it repeats the color of the last word mentioned before itself.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the following word (or the last word before it if it is at the end).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,2
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" across all provided examples.
Based on the given examples, each nonce word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- Every instance of ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- Every instance of ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""
- Every instance of ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
- ""bluf"" follows the pattern with ""dax,"" since in the third example, ""bluf wif"" leads to ""green red,"" but there isn't enough information to assign a specific color to ""bluf"" alone, as it is not used in isolation.

The rule, therefore, appears to be that each nonce word translates to a specific color when used in an input. According to this pattern, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, ""zup"" appears to be a rule that changes the output color sequence. To determine the specific rule, let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   When ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red
   Again, ""lug"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""blue,"" while ""bluf"" and ""wif"" translate to ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively. The presence of ""zup"" doesn't seem to affect ""bluf"" or ""wif.""

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" after ""zup"" is ""blue."" The sequence after ""zup"" repeats ""walm"" making it ""yellow"" for each ""walm.""

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" but ""walm"" after ""lug walm zup lug"" doesn't repeat like it does in example 3.

5. Input: lug dax zup
   Output: blue green yellow
   ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" at the end adds ""yellow."" 

""Zup"" seems to insert the color ""yellow"" before the color that is mentioned immediately after it, and when ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" it causes the output of ""yellow"" to repeat for each ""walm"" that follows consecutively. When ""zup"" is at the end, it appends ""yellow"" to the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> inserts ""yellow"" before the next color or at the end if there are no following colors; if ""walm"" follows consecutively, it repeats ""yellow"" for each ""walm.""
bluf -> repeats the color mentioned just before it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is used after another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated. For example, ""lug dax bluf"" outputs ""blue green green"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is green.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can compare the input strings and their corresponding outputs to identify patterns associated with the use of ""walm."" Let's analyze the examples against the outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" However, after ""walm"" is introduced, ""wif"" still translates to ""red,"" but now it is proceeded by two extra ""blue"" tokens before it.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is followed by two additional ""blue"" tokens, likely corresponding to ""walm.""

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: We have ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow."" When ""walm"" is present, each time we see an additional occurrence of the color that precedes it, followed by the base color. So ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" and ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" 

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Analysis: We observe the repetition pattern associated with ""walm"" again, where the color prior to it appears three times in succession.

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   Analysis: Yet again, ""walm"" is followed by a triplet of the color word just before it and then continues with the base colors of the following words.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color word before it two additional times. 

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax bluf
    ",Output: red green green,red green green,True,3
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule governing the word ""dax."" Let's examine each input and its corresponding output to identify any patterns:

1. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
2. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
3. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green
4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

By examining the inputs and outputs, we can identify the following:
- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"", as seen in the inputs and respective outputs where ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- The output for ""walm"" is not entirely clear from a single instance. However, considering the consistency of the other words, and that in the final example ""walm"" appears three times and is followed by ""yellow"" each time, it would suggest that ""walm"" may output to ""yellow,"" although additional context or examples would be needed to confirm this.

Considering the above deductions, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output across all examples provided.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow."" Therefore:

zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow. Rule: Every instance of ""zup"" is replaced with ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" has the rule of repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the pattern:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green"": ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue"": ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the sequences and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   Analysis: 
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,""
   - ""dax"" to ""green,"" and
   - ""wif"" to ""red.""
   
2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Analysis: The presence of ""wif"" and ""lug"" before ""walm"" seems to result in the color associated with ""lug"" being repeated.

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   Analysis: Here, the color repeated is the one associated with ""dax.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Analysis: The pattern is the same as the one before; ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated.

Based on the patterns above, ""walm"" seems to cause the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, each input word translates to a specific color in the output. We can see that whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position:

1. ""dax wif lug"" -> ""green red blue""
2. ""lug wif lug wif lug"" -> ""blue red blue red blue""
3. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
4. ""zup lug zup dax"" -> ""yellow blue yellow green""
5. ""zup lug zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue""

From these examples, it can be concluded that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Analyzing the examples given where each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to its own output, we can infer the following:

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green
- Here, both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green"".

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- The ""dax"" at the end corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- The first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- The ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

It seems that every instance of ""dax"" leads to the output ""green"". Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, I will try to deduce the meaning or rule for ""wif"" by observing its usage and the corresponding outputs.

Here's a breakdown:

1. Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red.""

2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" again to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green."" The term ""wif"" aligns with ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
   ""walm"" repeatedly matches ""blue"" (from previous examples, but outputs ""red"" here), ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""wif"" appears at the beginning and aligns with ""red.""

4. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""walm"" with ""blue"" (though it outputs ""red"" when following ""wif""), ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue.""

5. Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

From the examples, we can see the following:

- Whenever the input has ""wif,"" the corresponding output is ""red.""
- The word ""wif"" seems to change the output color of some words that follow it when compared to their standard output color in isolation or when ""wif"" doesn't precede them.

To deduce a rule for ""wif"":

- ""wif"" itself directly corresponds to the color ""red.""
- When ""wif"" precedes another color word, it changes its corresponding output to ""red."" This is clear with the word ""walm,"" which usually translates to ""blue"" but shifts to ""red"" when it directly follows ""wif.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow."" This implies ""wif"" does not change the output of every word that follows it.

Given these observations, the rule for ""wif"" can potentially be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and may change the following color word to ""red"" unless the word typically corresponds to ""yellow.""

However, without more examples, especially ones that show ""wif"" preceding a variety of color words, this rule might not accurately predict every scenario. It is based on the limited data provided.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From the provided examples, we can determine the color associated with the word ""bluf."" Let's look at each instance of ""bluf"" and the color it corresponds to in the output:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow
4. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
5. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow

In each case, the color that follows ""bluf"" in the output is identical to the color that precedes it. This consistency across different examples suggests that ""bluf"" causes the next term (color) to replicate the previous term (color). It does not seem to have a color of its own; instead, it repeats the preceding color. Based on this observation, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> Causes the next term to repeat the color of the previous term.
Analyzing the given examples, it's possible to deduce a pattern for the word ""walm"" as it relates to the output colors. Let's look at the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
   ""dax"" correlates to green, ""wif"" correlates to red, and following ""walm,"" the color red is repeated multiple times.
   
2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   
   Here ""zup"" correlates to yellow. After the first ""walm,"" the preceding color (yellow) is repeated twice before changing to red once ""wif"" is encountered. Then, following the second ""walm,"" red is repeated twice.
   
3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   
   ""bluf"" correlates to green, and ""lug"" correlates to blue. After ""walm,"" red is repeated three times before meeting a new color word ""lug.""
   
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
   Following ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated twice, which is the color associated with the preceding word ""lug.""

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   
   After ""walm,"" green is repeated twice more which is the color associated with the preceding word ""dax."" This also shows that the repetition effect of ""walm"" ceases when a new color word is encountered.

The consistent rule that emerges is that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it (if that word has a color associated with it) multiple times until a new color word is encountered. Based on the given examples, it's not completely clear how many times the color should be repeated, but it seems to be depending on the presence of other color words.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word multiple times until a new color word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow,green yellow green yellow,True,5
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the examples provided.
dax -> green

Rule: In the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the rule or meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the examples provided and see if there are any consistent patterns correlating the presence of ""bluf"" to the output:

1. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""
2. ""wif bluf dax lug"" results in ""red red green blue.""
3. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" results in ""blue red red blue red.""
4. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" results in ""red green red red yellow red.""
5. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue red blue green green.""

In most cases, it seems that ""bluf"" leads to a repeated color in the output. Specifically, it repeats the color immediately preceding ""bluf"":

Example 1: The color preceding ""bluf"" is ""green,"" and the output is ""green green.""
Example 2: The color preceding ""bluf"" is ""red,"" and the output has ""red red.""
Example 3: The color preceding ""bluf"" is ""red,"" and the output has ""red red.""
Example 5: The color preceding ""bluf"" is ""green,"" and the output has ""green green.""

However, Example 4 does not fully fit this pattern because ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" but there is no ""yellow"" before ""bluf."" Thus, ""bluf"" may not influence the color after it but instead repeats the color immediately before it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze each example and look for patterns.

- In examples 1 and 3 (""lug walm"" and ""lug walm zup""), ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times. This suggests that when ""lug"" is present, ""walm"" might mean ""blue"" repeated as many times as there are words following ""lug.""

- In example 4 (""zup walm""), ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times, which could imply that ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it and repeats it the same number of times as there are words in the input.

- In example 2 (""lug dax walm""), ""walm"" follows ""lug dax,"" and the output is ""blue green green green."" This could mean ""walm"" is taking the colors associated with ""lug"" and ""dax"" (blue and green, respectively) and adding to the repetition by one.

- In example 5 (""lug dax walm wif""), ""walm"" follows ""lug dax"" again, and the output includes one new color ""red"" which is likely from ""wif."" The pattern of repeating the colors associated with the preceding words continues, with an additional repetition of ""green"" for ""dax.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:
""walm"" repeats the sequence of colors associated with the preceding words. It starts by repeating the color of the first word before it, then continues with the next, adding an extra repetition for each subsequent word. If ""walm"" stands alone (after one word), it repeats that color three times.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:
Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with each word immediately before ""walm"" in the sequence, beginning with three repetitions for the first word and adding one additional repetition for each word present before ""walm,"" except for the word directly before ""walm,"" which sets the color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,6
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Each example shows that no matter the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence, the output is always ""green"" when the term ""dax"" is present. Meanwhile, other words like ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" seem to correspond to different colors (""red,"" ""green,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively), and their positions do not appear to influence their output.

As ""dax"" is a nonce word (a made-up word without a previously defined meaning), we are determining its meaning strictly based on its context within the examples. The consistent output of ""green"" whenever ""dax"" appears indicates a rule that the presence of ""dax"" leads directly to the output of ""green.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce from these examples is as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" and ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to determine the pattern of how input words correspond to output colors. Observing each example:

1. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to 'green,' and when ""zup"" follows, we get 'yellow.'

2. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

""dax"" again corresponds to 'green,' ""walm"" also corresponds to 'green,' and ""wif"" gives us 'red.' After all these, ""zup"" adds a 'yellow.'

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

""zup"" is the first word and corresponds to 'yellow,' and ""bluf"" seems to also correspond to 'yellow.'

4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

Here ""zup"" is followed by 'yellow,' ""wif"" by 'red,' and ""bluf"" again by 'red.'

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

""zup"" starts with 'yellow,' ""dax"" is 'green,' ""walm"" is 'green,' ""lug"" appears for the first time, and it is 'blue,' and finally, ""wif"" is 'red.'

Based on these examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow.' So the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Therefore:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" acts as a rule to repeat the color that immediately precedes it. Here is the breakdown:

1. lug walm wif lug bluf
- lug -> blue
- walm -> (ignored in output)
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word ""lug"", which is blue
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

2. lug wif bluf
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word ""wif"", which is red
Output: blue red red

3. lug bluf zup lug
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word ""lug"", which is blue
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
Output: blue blue yellow blue

4. wif bluf dax
- wif -> red
- bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word ""wif"", which is red
- dax -> green
Output: red red green

5. wif bluf lug zup
- wif -> red
- bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word ""wif"", which is red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
Output: red red blue yellow

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relation between the input words and the colors in the output. We will look for patterns of when ""walm"" appears and the colors that follow it.

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the following colors are red.

- wif walm -> red red red
- zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
- lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the following color is also red, except for the one case where ""wif"" follows ""zup walm"" and it is yellow.

- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red

3. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the following color is green.

- dax walm -> green green green
- zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
- lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

4. ""walm"" consistently results in the same color either repeating three times (in the case when it's the second word) or makes the following color be red when it does not repeat the previous color. This would suggest that ""walm"" acts as a sort of repeater or intensifier for the previous word's associated color, or as a reset to red if it is incompatible with this rule.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the same color for the word preceding it three times. If the word that precedes ""walm"" is incompatible with repeating three times, it defaults to red.

walm -> causes the previous color to repeat three times or defaults to red if the repeat rule does not apply.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,7
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each instance where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. **Input:** dax
   **Output:** green

2. **Input:** zup wif dax wif bluf
   **Output:** yellow red green red red

3. **Input:** dax
   **Output:** green

4. **Input:** wif dax wif lug wif
   **Output:** red green red blue red

5. **Input:** zup lug zup wif dax
   **Output:** yellow blue yellow red green

In all five examples, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. This consistency across different inputs supports the conclusion that:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the last mentioned color
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red""

When we look at the pattern in which the word ""wif"" appears and the output that follows, we notice:

- In the first example, after ""wif"" follows ""dax"", and ""red"" precedes ""green"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is directly followed by ""walm"", and the output is ""red"" followed by another ""red"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and is followed by ""red"" in both instances.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" followed by ""dax"", and the output sequence is ""red"" followed by ""red"" and ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and then another ""wif"" followed by ""dax"", with the output being ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""green"".

It appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" every time it is used. There is no context-dependent rule that alters the meaning of ""wif"" in the examples provided; it consistently equates to ""red"" regardless of what follows.

Hence, the meaning is:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that comes before it.

Examples to support this rule:
1. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"" - ""bluf"" repeated the color associated with ""dax"".
2. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""red red yellow yellow red"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"" and then repeats the color of ""zup"". The last ""wif"" stands alone without a following ""bluf"", so its color is not repeated.
3. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"".
4. ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"", and ""dax"" stands alone without a following ""bluf"", so its color is not repeated.
5. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, which in this case is ""lug"".

Therefore, bluf -> repeating the color of the preceding word.
From the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

3. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

4. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Analyzing the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes just before it:

- In example 1, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" also produces ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" following which ""walm"" leads to ""red.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and then ""walm"" produces ""green.""
- In example 4, ""lug"" is represented by ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" results in additional ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" also translates to ""red.""

Based on this observation, the rule governing ""walm"" can be expressed as:

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""dax"":

- When ""dax"" is mentioned alone, the output is ""green"".
- Each occurrence of ""dax"" in a sequence corresponds to a ""green"" in the output sequence.

Other words like ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" seem to produce outputs independent of the presence of ""dax,"" since in the third example, ""walm"" and ""wif"" both produce ""green,"" while ""bluf"" produces ""red."" Meanwhile, in the fifth example, ""wif"" yields ""red,"" and ""bluf"" yields ""yellow."" However, ""zup"" consistently yields ""yellow"" in both the first and fifth examples.

Without additional context or examples for the other words, it is difficult to further deduce their specific meanings or rules. However, for ""dax,"" the rule appears consistent:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red"". There is no context given where ""wif"" translates to or is influenced by any other words or positions in a sequence. Thus, we can induce a simple and direct rule for the meaning of ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Each unique nonce word corresponds to a unique color: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""yellow"" equal to the number of letters in ""walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Bluf"" seems to be a repetition of ""red,"" but as it only appears once, the rule for ""bluf"" is not as clear as the others. The color for ""zup"" remains consistent as ""yellow"" in each instance regardless of position or surrounding words.

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in each provided example. We will examine the relationship between the input and output sequences.

Let's analyze each input-output pair and find the placement of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output color:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the outputs ""green"" and ""blue"".

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue"".

3. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red"".

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"".

5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green"".

At first glance, it seems that ""bluf"" could be directly mapped to a specific color, but the output colors corresponding to ""bluf"" are different across examples. One observation, however, is that in every sequence where ""bluf"" appears, the color that corresponds to it matches the color that immediately precedes it in the output sequence.

From this observation, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the item that immediately precedes it in the output sequence. 

So:

bluf -> the color that precedes it in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the input and output sequences. Observing the patterns, we see that every time ""walm"" is mentioned, a sequence of the same color repeats in the output, with the number of repetitions apparently linked to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Here ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" Again, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" The first ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times, and the second occurrence of ""walm"" also follows ""lug,"" hence ""blue"" is again repeated three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

From these observations, we can discern a pattern: ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the preceding word to be outputted multiple times. Additionally, the number of times the color is repeated seems consistent at three, regardless of which word precedes ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding itself to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- Each other word seems to correlate with a specific color: ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that each nonce word is associated with a specific color in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples where the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"", the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red. 

Meaning that ""wif"" represents the color red in each instance provided.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we must look for patterns in the given examples. 

From the first example:
Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" seems to also correspond to ""blue."" Following this pattern, ""zup"" must correspond to ""yellow.""

From the second example:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Since ""walm"" was ""blue"" in the first example but ""yellow"" in this second example, it's possible that when ""zup"" appears before ""walm,"" it changes the color associated with ""walm."" Otherwise, ""zup"" itself means ""yellow,"" which aligns with the first example.

From the third example:
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Here, ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red."" ""Zup"" appears twice, once after ""walm"" and once after ""lug,"" resulting in ""yellow"" each time.

From the fourth example:
Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
In this input, ""zup"" is preceded by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow,"" not influenced by ""bluf"" which corresponds to ""red,"" maintaining the consistency of ""zup"" meaning ""yellow.""

From the final example:
Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
Consistent with the previous patterns, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

By examining all examples, the rule is clear:
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes ""bluf"" in the sequence. If no color word precedes it, ""bluf"" takes the meaning ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns and relationships in the given examples.

In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" is followed by three yellow outputs.

In the second example, ""zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" alone is followed by three yellows again.

In the third example, ""lug walm zup,"" ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""lug,"" which produces blue outputs, but ""walm"" itself is followed by one yellow, which deviates from the three-yellows pattern we initially saw.

In the fourth example, ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again, and this time ""walm"" is followed by three blue outputs and no yellow, which is entirely different from the patterns we saw before.

In the fifth example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows the sequence ""zup lug zup"" and is followed by three yellows, which is again a different pattern.

Upon observing these examples, it is challenging to find a single consistent meaning for ""walm"" since its output colors depend on the context of the preceding word(s). However, there is one consistency: the color following ""walm"" is always the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" we see yellow as the output, just like ""zup"" on its own. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it is followed by blue outputs, the same color associated with ""lug.""

Hence, ""walm"" appears to take on the color of the preceding word in the sequence. However, this rule does not explain why in some cases ""walm"" is followed by a triplet of the same color, while in other cases it's a single color. There might not be enough context to fully understand this aspect of the pattern.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" causes the output color to match the output color of the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" as it relates to the outputs given.

In every example where ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is either ""blue"" or includes ""blue"" multiple times. This consistency across examples suggests that ""lug"" correlates directly to the color blue. However, when ""lug"" is combined with ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times. This repetition suggests that ""walm"" may signify some repetition or emphasis of the color associated with ""lug,"" which we've established as blue, although we do not have enough information to establish a rule for ""walm.""

Here's the rule based on the consistent pattern seen in the examples:

Rule: lug -> blue

So, wherever ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color blue in the output.
From the examples provided, we can infer the meaning of ""dax"" by comparing the inputs and the associated outputs:

1. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"".

2. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Here, ""dax"" directly corresponds to ""green"".

3. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

4. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" again.

5. Input: lug dax lug wif
   Output: blue green blue red
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

In every instance, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"". Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, there is a consistent pattern where ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" This pattern holds true regardless of where ""wif"" appears in the sequence. Here is how ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in each example:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red.""

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green
- ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red.""

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow
- ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""wif"" follows ""zup bluf"" and is followed by ""walm,"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red.""

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- ""wif"" is surrounded by ""lug"" but still corresponds to ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates to the color that precedes it. More specifically, ""bluf"" results in the repeated color word that appeared just before it in the input sequence. The only exception appears to be ""wif bluf"", which results in ""red red"", even though we would expect ""red blue"" if the rule were to repeat the preceding color.

However, because ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in all other contexts, and given that the output is always a repetition of a color, we can reasonably assume that the discrepancy might be a mistake or exception. We should follow the more consistent interpretation where ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color to determine the rule accurately.

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color word that came immediately before it in the input sequence, resulting in that color being said twice in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we should examine the consistent pattern across the given examples with their respective outputs.

Input: zup wif walm  
Output: yellow red red red

The output for ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and given the three reds subsequent to ""wif walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" repeated the color of the word before it.

Input: lug walm wif lug  
Output: blue blue blue red blue

The output for ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. Between the two ""lug"" words, we have ""walm wif,"" which corresponds to blue blue followed by red. It reinforces the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

Input: dax walm wif bluf  
Output: green green green red red

The output for ""dax"" is green and ""wif"" is red. After repeating the color for ""dax walm,"" ""wif"" changes the color to red.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif  
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Following the rule deduced above, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" after ""lug"" becomes blue, ""zup"" changes the color to yellow, and ""wif"" follows as red.

Input: dax walm  
Output: green green green

Here, following ""dax"" with green, ""walm"" repeats green twice, which aligns with the established pattern.

So, based on the pattern across the examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to correlate with repetition. Specifically:

Rule: walm -> meaning: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word directly before it thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of context.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule for what ""dax"" represents by isolating its occurrences and observing the Output associated with it. 

**Example 1**: ""dax"" occurs between ""wif"" and ""bluf"". The output for the position of ""dax"" is green.

**Example 2**: ""dax"" occurs on its own. The output for ""dax"" is green.

**Example 3**: ""dax"" occurs after ""walm"" and before ""zup"". The output for ""dax"" is green.

**Example 4**: ""dax"" occurs at the beginning followed by ""lug"". The output for ""dax"" is green.

**Example 5**: ""dax"" occurs between ""wif"" and ""walm"". The output for ""dax"" is green.

In each occurrence, no matter what the position or the words around it, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" 

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" always translates to the color green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", I'll examine the patterns in the input and output pairs you've given.

Here's what we have:

- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
- ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
- ""zup wif lug"" -> ""yellow red blue""
- ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

The color that appears consistently whenever ""wif"" is present is ""red."" The word ""bluf"" also seems to be consistently translated to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" 

When ""wif"" is paired with ""bluf"", we always see ""red red"" as the output, and when ""wif"" is paired with ""lug,"" we get ""red blue."" 

It also appears that when ""wif"" is not present, a different color is the first color outputted (In the first three examples, ""zup"" gives ""yellow"" and ""dax"" gives ""green""). However, when ""wif"" stands alone with either ""lug"" or ""bluf,"" the first color stated is always ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" might be associated with the color ""red,"" specifically as the first color mentioned in the output.

Based on this, we could deduce:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" as the first color in an output sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context in which it is used.
Based on the examples provided where the word ""bluf"" is present, I can deduce the following pattern regarding the output:

1. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" being the only word associated with ""blue.""
2. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" again with ""bluf"" being associated with a color, which in this case is ""green.""
3. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red,"" with ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red.""
4. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" once more with ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red.""
5. ""wif bluf"" again translates to ""red red,"" where ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

From these examples, ""bluf"" consistently maps to a color output. However, the color associated with ""bluf"" appears to depend on the context or the preceding word(s). In the first example, ""bluf"" is blue, in the second and third examples, ""bluf"" is green when preceded by ""dax,"" and in the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" is red when preceded by ""wif.""

Therefore, we can establish a rule based on context:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output, and the specific color is influenced by the preceding word(s) in the input.

If we were to summarize the meaning based on these examples alone, with the specific relationship to the preceding word remaining unclear but acknowledging that ""bluf"" represents a color, the meaning could be deduced as:

bluf -> color
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

By comparing the inputs with their outputs, we can try to determine the pattern for ""walm"" and other words:

- The word ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""

Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output shows a repetition of the color that maps to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Now let's apply this rule to ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output shows ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" might represent a repetition of the last color mentioned, which is three times ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and therefore ""walm"" leads to three times ""green.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" again, which leads to three times ""green"" after ""green"" once for ""dax,"" meaning ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of the last mentioned color.
- In example 4, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" which results in ""red red red.""
- In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Given the consistent pattern that ""walm"" results in a thrice repetition of the last color stated, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: Walm -> Causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,12
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug translates to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> red

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output colors repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf."" To elaborate, let's review the examples:

1. dax bluf => green green
   ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" so after ""bluf,"" we get ""green"" repeated.

2. lug bluf zup => blue blue yellow
   ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" we get ""blue"" repeated. ""zup"" at the end leads to ""yellow.""

3. zup dax bluf => yellow green green
   ""dax,"" which is right before ""bluf,"" leads to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" we get ""green"" repeated. ""zup"" at the beginning leads to ""yellow.""

4. wif bluf => red red
   ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" so after ""bluf,"" we get ""red"" repeated.

5. zup lug bluf => yellow blue blue
   ""lug,"" which is right before ""bluf,"" leads to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" we get ""blue"" repeated. ""zup"" at the beginning leads to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: If a color word precedes ""bluf,"" the output will contain that color repeated twice following the sequence of the previous words.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" generates repeated output of the color word that precedes it. To determine this rule, let's break down each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" is followed by a ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated thrice.


2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""zup"" precedes the ""walm"" and is associated with ""yellow"", so ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated thrice, since the immediate color word before ""walm"" is “zup” (yellow).

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Analysis: Here again, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated thrice.

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: With ""lug"" before ""walm"", ""blue"" is outputted thrice.

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: As before, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Based on the analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

Using this rule, ""walm"" generates a sequence of three of whichever color word comes right before it. Hence, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" makes it appear thrice. Similarly, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif walm
    ",Output: blue red red red,blue red red red,True,13
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is included in the output at the exact position where ""lug"" would correlate. Here are the instances of ""lug"" with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
3. Input: wif dax lug -> Output: red green blue
4. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
5. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue

From the examples, it is consistently seen that ""lug"" does not affect the appearance or position of other colors in the output, implying that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".

lug -> meaning: When ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in every given example. Regardless of its position in the input or the other words around it, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.
The task is to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" based on the given inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red

3. Input: dax lug wif lug
   Output: green blue red blue

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

By comparing the inputs with their outputs, we can observe the following:

- Everywhere the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- ""wif"" does not depend on its position in the input to determine its output.
  
Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"", regardless of context in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Given the examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. There is no apparent context dependency on other words; ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" despite the words around it, which correlate with other colors.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the appearance of ""bluf"" in the input correlates with the duplication of the color word that directly follows it in the output. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the next color word in the sequence to repeat.

Now, let's formalize this rule with respect to each input and output example, to verify the rule's consistency:

1. ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" - This is consistent because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated.

2. ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"" - Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of ""blue.""

3. ""wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green green"" - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Bluf"" causes ""green"" to be repeated as it follows ""dax.""

4. ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow"" - ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" makes ""yellow"" repeat since it follows ""zup.""

5. ""wif dax zup bluf"" outputs ""red green yellow yellow"" - ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""Bluf"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" that comes directly after ""zup.""

Thus, the induction suggests:

bluf -> Causes the immediate subsequent color word to be repeated in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can see that the presence of ""walm"" in the input leads to a sequence of one specific color being repeated three times, followed by the outputs of other words in the sequence. Here's what we can deduce from each example:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to blue once, but when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it leads to blue being outputted three times.

2. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" likely corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" being present leads to that color being outputted three times.

3. ""zup walm dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" which confirms that ""walm"" following ""zup"" leads to three yellows, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and reinforces that ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

4. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" again showing the pattern of ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" leading to three blues.

5. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" In this sequence, we see that when ""walm"" follows after ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), it results in three reds before continuing with the output corresponding to ""lug"" again, which is blue.

The consistent pattern here is that the word ""walm"" makes the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word appear three times in succession before continuing with the rest of the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word that corresponds to a color, it causes that color to be outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning is ""blue"".

Rule: lug corresponds to the color blue, regardless of the context in which it appears.
To determine the meaning or pattern associated with the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine each input/output pair and look for occurrences and positions of ""dax"" and how they correlate with the output.

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green
- In this example, ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- In this case, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for both words is ""green.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup,"" and the output for ""dax"" is once again ""green.""

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""

In every example, irrespective of its position or the words around it, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in which it appears and the output it produces:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red

2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

3. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green

4. Input: lug zup dax wif
   Output: blue yellow green red

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

Observations:

- ""wif"" by itself produces ""red.""
- ""wif"" does not appear to change its output based on the preceding or following words, as it always produces ""red"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.
- The other words (""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm"") correlate with different colors (""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue"" respectively).

Rule:
wif -> red
To ascertain the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the position of ""zup"" in the input strings and its potential relationship to the colors in the output strings.

Input: wif lug zup
Output: red blue yellow
- ""wif"" correlates with red, ""lug"" correlates with blue, and ""zup"" at the end correlates with yellow.

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""lug"" correlates with blue, ""wif"" correlates with red, ""walm"" with blue, and ""zup"" in the middle correlates with yellow. Notice following ""zup,"" the colors repeat once for each word before ""zup"" (in the order they appeared). 

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" correlates with blue, ""walm"" has repeated blue from the previous case, and ""zup"" correlates with yellow again. The repetition rule does not apply because there are no words following ""zup.""

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
- ""zup"" at the beginning correlates with yellow, ""lug"" with blue, and ""bluf"" with blue, ""wif"" with red. Since ""zup"" is at the beginning, there's no preceding context for it to affect.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" correlates to green, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and ""bluf"" (even though not previously correlated) outputs yellow. No repetition rule is evident since there is no word following ""zup.""

From these inputs and outputs, we can deduce that:

- ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow.
- When ""zup"" is followed by other words, there seems to be a repetition rule where the colors that appeared before ""zup"" are repeated once in the same order for each following word.

Rule: ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow. If there are words after ""zup,"" repeat the sequence of colors that appeared before ""zup"" once for each following word.
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the output color being the same as the immediately preceding word's output color.

To illustrate this:

- ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"" (The color before ""bluf"" is green, so ""bluf"" is also green.)
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (The color before ""bluf"" is green, so ""bluf"" is also green.)
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red"" (The color before ""bluf"" is blue, so ""bluf"" is also blue.)
- ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green"" (The color before ""bluf"" is red, so ""bluf"" is also red.)
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (The color before ""bluf"" is red, so ""bluf"" is also red.)

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color output of the word immediately before it.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" corresponds to a rule that affects the color associated with the next word following ""walm."" To deduce the rule, we can look at the change in the pattern when ""walm"" is introduced:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   Here, ""wif"" is normally red but becomes green after ""walm.""

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Here, ""wif"" is again normally red but becomes yellow after ""walm.""

3. Input: dax walm wif 
   Output: green green green red
   The presence of ""walm"" before ""wif"" causes ""wif"" to be green instead of red.

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   ""Dax"" is normally green but after ""walm,"" it becomes yellow.

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Here, both ""dax"" and ""wif"" change colors after ""walm.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the following word to take the color that is normally associated with the word ""zup."" The color normally associated with ""zup"" is yellow, and when ""walm"" is present before another word, that word takes on the yellow color output instead of its usual color.

Rule: walm -> causes the next word to be associated with the color yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue regardless of the position in the input sequence or the presence of other nonce words.
Analyzing the examples given, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that precede or follow it. This can be determined by noting that every input containing ""dax"" has an output with ""green"" at the position corresponding to where ""dax"" is in the input.

Here are the observations taken from each input and output:

   - ""dax"" is the third word and corresponds to the third color ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.
From the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the word ""red."" Here is the breakdown of the examples:

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
Analysis: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""; ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
Analysis: ""lug"" translates to ""blue""; ""walm"" might be related to ""blue"" as well due to adjacency; ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red
Analysis: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""; ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow""; ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Input: zup lug wif
Output: yellow blue red
Analysis: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""; ""lug"" translates to ""blue""; ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow
Analysis: ""dax"" translates to ""green""; ""wif"" translates to ""red""; ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""; ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look at the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding output. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. Input: zup walm 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif 
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
3. Input: wif walm zup 
   Output: red red red yellow
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm 
   Output: red red green green green
5. Input: dax lug walm 
   Output: green blue blue blue

From the above patterns, we can try to extract the rule for ""walm.""

Example 1 provides the simplest scenario. ""Zup"" seems to trigger ""yellow,"" which might indicate that ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow."" However, without further context, this is not enough.

Example 2 introduces ""lug"" and ""wif"" before and after ""walm"" along with a ""zup"" at the end. Each occurrence of ""lug"" outputs a ""blue,"" and the final ""wif"" gives a ""red."" Curiously, ""walm"" here is followed by ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup."" So here, it seems that ""walm"" does not necessarily mean ""yellow.""

Example 3 has ""wif"" before ""walm"" and ""zup"" after. Both the ""wif"" and ""zup"" outputs follow the same pattern of colors as established in the previous examples, ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The appearance of ""walm"" has led to multiple ""red"" outputs before it switches to the ""yellow"" prompt by ""zup.""

Combining the insights from examples 4 and 5 with the earlier examples may imply that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word just before it until a different color word is mentioned or until the sequence ends. In example 4, ""dax"" means ""green,"" and we see ""green"" repeated after ""walm."" In example 5, ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is repeated after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word just prior to it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True,16
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Other words in the sequence correspond to different colors: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

- In the first example, ""zup wif zup,"" the output is ""yellow red yellow."" The word ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red,"" whereas ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the output starts with ""red,"" which corresponds to the initial ""wif,"" and the sequence of other words translates to their respective colors.
- When ""wif"" is the only word in the input, as in the third example, the output is simply ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax,"" the output is ""red green,"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Considering the consistency across all examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color each time it appears. In each instance where ""zup"" is used, it is followed by a color in the output. The color that corresponds to ""zup"" is consistent across all examples.

The following are the inputs and outputs for ""zup"":

- Input: zup lug zup dax -> Output: yellow blue yellow green
- Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
- Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
- Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
- Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green

In every case, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, we can deduce the meaning as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears, it repeats the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before it. For example, when ""zup"" (which corresponds to the color ""yellow"") is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" means to repeat the preceding color. Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". When these words precede ""bluf"", the color associated with them is repeated in the output.
Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. To demonstrate the rule:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" indicates that ""blue"" should be repeated three times.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""walm"" indicates that ""green"" should be repeated three times, the word directly preceding ""walm.""
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" indicates that ""yellow"" should be repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" (repeated example) -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": This confirms the consistency of ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeating it three times.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"": Here we see ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" repeating ""yellow"" three times. The last ""lug"" is another ""blue,"" consistent with its associated color.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly preceding it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,17
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". The other words in the inputs (""zup"", ""dax"", ""wif"") translate to other colors following a consistent pattern.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can make the following observations:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is always ""green.""
2. The word ""dax"" does not seem to alter based on its position within the input sequence.
3. Other words in the inputs correspond to different colors in the outputs, but ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""wif"" is always translated to ""red.""
Based on the input and output pairs provided, there seems to be a direct correspondence between the nonce word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input maps to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
2. ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> ""red red green blue""
3. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
5. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

Looking at these examples, we can see the word ""bluf"" directly translates to a color. To isolate the exact color corresponding to ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the output:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last color mentioned, which is ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to the last color mentioned, which is ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to the last color mentioned just before it, which is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is at the end, but following the pattern from previous examples might indicate that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" since ""wif"" precedes it twice.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" following the pattern right after ""lug"" and before another ""lug.""

From these observations, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes its meaning from the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.

Therefore, ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning but instead, its meaning changes depending on the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the word before it in the sequence.
From the examples provided, the rule seems to involve repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" as many times as there are syllables in the nonce word ""walm."" Since ""walm"" is a single-syllable word, its color repetition rule is to repeat the preceding color once more than the number of times that the preceding color word appears.

Let's look at the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". ""Dax"" translates to green, and ""walm"" means we repeat ""green"" one extra time, totaling three greens.
2. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" translates to blue, so ""walm"" makes us repeat blue three times.
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow."" ""Wif"" translates to red, so ""walm"" makes us repeat red three times.
4. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red."" Again, ""dax"" is green, so ""walm"" repeats green three times.
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Wif"" is red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the word immediately before it three times, as ""walm"" has one syllable and the repeat count is one plus the number of times the preceding color word appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax lug
    ",Output: red yellow green blue,red yellow green blue,True,18
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
dax -> meaning. Meaning can be ""green.""

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" When ""dax"" is present in the input, the output always includes ""green."" If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output starts with ""red green."" If ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" each occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to ""red."" The presence of ""lug"" before ""dax"" results in ""blue green."" The standalone word ""dax"" when it is the sole input results in the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Thus:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" should be in the corresponding output at the same position relative to other colors.
Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

2. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue

3. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue

4. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

Looking at these, it appears:

- Each input word corresponds to a color in the output.
- The word that precedes ""bluf"" in the input determines the color that ""bluf"" refers to in the output.

Checking the examples:

- In example 1, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the corresponding output colors are ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.
- Example 2 has ""lug"" before ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" which supports this rule.
- The pattern continues with examples 3, 4, and 5, where ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" resulting in ""blue blue,"" and ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" resulting in ""green green.""

Based on the examples, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word before it in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can try to induce the rule that defines what ""walm"" means by analyzing the patterns and differences in the input and their corresponding output. Here's what we have:

1. Input: lug walm — Output: blue blue blue
2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif — Output: red red green green red red red blue red
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm — Output: yellow yellow red red red
4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup — Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
5. Input: zup walm wif — Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Looking at these examples, specifically at where ""walm"" appears and what it produces in the output, we can attempt to formulate a rule.

In examples 1 and 2, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and when ""walm"" follows ""lug"", we see repeated ""blue"" in the output. In example 2, ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output also features ""blue,"" but it appears only once rather than repeated.

In example 3, ""walm"" is at the end after ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and the output has two additional ""red"" after the expected ""red"" from ""wif.""

Example 4 shows ""walm"" between ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow), with the output being ""blue blue blue"" before finishing with ""yellow."" The repeated color, in this case, is ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""

Example 5 positions ""walm"" after ""zup"" (yellow), and the result is two extra ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on the patterns above, ""walm"" seems to cause the last color stated before it to be repeated two additional times. Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned before it two more times in the output. If ""walm"" appears at the end, it continues the pattern of the last translated word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the last mentioned color two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,19
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
2. Other words in the sequence, such as ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif,"" correspond to other colors, but their meanings are not requested in this instance.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the presented examples, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each example that includes the word ""dax"" yields ""green"" in the associated position in the output. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> green. Rule: When ""dax"" is present in the input, the output is ""green"" at the corresponding position.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the examples provided and the respective outputs.

1. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - We see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The new word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Following the pattern from the previous example, ""wif"" is linked to ""red"" again. Then ""walm,"" which was ""blue"" earlier, is now ""red.""

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" is ""blue"" again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - Following previous patterns, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" but ""bluf"" is a new word that corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

From these examples, it seems like ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is produced in the corresponding output. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color that is mentioned just before it. When ""bluf"" follows a color word, the output is that color repeated. Here's the pattern based on the inputs and outputs given:

- In the first example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"" in the output. There are two instances of ""wif"" following ""bluf"", and the outputs for those are ""green red"".
- In the second example, there's only ""zup"" before ""bluf"", which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. The output is ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" took on the color of the previous word.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"", suggesting that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word right before it, which in this case is ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue"", once again showing that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word right before it, which is ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that directly precedes it. If ""bluf"" is the second word in the sequence, it repeats the color of the first word.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""walm.""

Let's examine each case:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Here, ""walm"" appears to result in the repetition of the preceding color (""red"" in this case) three times.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Similar to the previous examples, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   This is identical to the second example where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.

Rule:
If we consider the word preceding ""walm"" to determine its effect, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug bluf wif
    ",Output: green blue blue red,green blue blue red,True,20
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. 

Additional information based on the given examples: the output for other words can be inferred as well. Following the pattern in the examples:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""walm"" corresponds to green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red

Each word is consistently linked to the same color in the outputs provided.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to induce a rule for the meaning of ""dax."" We need to identify a pattern between the occurrences of ""dax"" in the inputs and the occurrences of a specific color in the corresponding outputs.

Let's examine the examples with regards to the presence of ""dax"" and the corresponding color output:

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif **dax**
   Output: red yellow yellow red **green**

2. Input: **dax** wif
   Output: **green** red

3. Input: lug walm **dax** wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue **blue** green red blue red

4. Input: **dax** lug walm **dax** wif bluf **dax**
   Output: **green** blue blue **blue** green red red **green**

5. Input: **dax**
   Output: **green**

In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, we see ""green"" in the corresponding position in the output, except for one case in example three where ""dax"" corresponds to ""blue."" However, that blue seems to be related to the preceding word ""walm,"" which consistently translates to ""blue"" across instances. The occurrence of ""blue"" instead of ""green"" after ""dax"" in the third example appears to be an exception due to the immediate preceding word ""walm"" and not due to the rule underlying ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for the nonce word ""dax"" is as follows:

**Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""**

So, the meaning is:
dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word has a corresponding color in English:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.red.red"" or ""red"" repeated three times
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" (which is derived from the fourth input, assuming ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" as ""dax"" does, given the output is ""green green red blue yellow"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"")

When the word ""wif"" is used in conjunction with other words, it translates to ""red"" as seen in the outputs:

- ""lug zup wif"" -> ""blue yellow red""
- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
- ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" -> ""green green red blue yellow""
- ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Given the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce a pattern for the meaning or rule of the nonce word 'zup'. Let's examine each input and output:

- ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax zup wif zup"" -> ""green yellow red yellow""
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""

From the above examples, it seems that the word 'zup' always corresponds to the word 'yellow' in the output, no matter its position or what other words are present in the input. The existence of other words like 'dax,' 'bluf,' 'wif,' 'lug,' and 'walm' corresponds to 'green,' 'yellow,' 'red,' and 'blue,' respectively, but 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'.

Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'
Based on the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color indicated by the word that comes immediately before it. The pattern indicates that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the previous word. 

Here are the color associations for the given words:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Using this pattern, let's check the provided examples:

1. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"".)

2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"".)

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"".)

4. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"".)

5. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"".)

Thus, we can conclude:

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color associated with the preceding word.
Analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to establish a pattern for the word ""walm"" by looking at the input sequences and their corresponding output sequences.

Example 1:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Example 2:
Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Example 3:
Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Example 4:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Example 5:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

By examining the pattern in which 'walm' appears and the colors that correspond to it and its surrounding words, the following observations can be made:

- When 'walm' is present, the color that precedes 'walm' repeats for each occurrence of 'walm'. For instance, in Example 1, 'wif' is associated with the color 'red', and after 'walm' we see 'red' repeated three times.

- In Example 3, 'lug' is associated with 'blue', and 'walm' leads to 'blue' being repeated twice.

- Example 5 further reinforces this pattern, showing that 'dax' (green) is repeated twice after 'walm'. There is no color that follows 'walm' here, suggesting that 'walm' does not need another color-word to determine its effect.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word for each 'walm' present.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" There is no variation in the output color regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. It does not seem to modify the output of words around it, and its presence consistently maps to the same output. So, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""wif"":

1. When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is always ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" appears alongside other nonce words, it generates an output following a certain pattern.

Here is how ""wif"" behaves in the given contexts:

- In ""wif dax,"" the presence of ""dax"" after ""wif"" results in an output of ""green"" following the ""red,"" which is the output for ""wif."" The rule here may be that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

- In ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" we can deduce the following: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" does not change the output for ""wif,"" which is ""red."" In this sequence, when ""wif"" appears for the second time, it again translates to ""red.""

- In ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" we observe ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" once more, meaning the first ""wif dax"" pair gives us ""red green"" as before. The presence of another ""wif"" right after seems to retain the ""red"" output, and ""bluf"" appears to do the same since after both instances, ""wif"" still translates to ""red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the last ""wif"" is ""red.""

Given these observations, we can form the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the output. It seems to maintain this meaning regardless of position or repetition. Other words like ""dax"" after ""wif"" result in their own colors, but do not change the color associated with ""wif.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it is used. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"". Thus, we can infer the meaning of ""zup"" as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" results in the output of a color that matches the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Thus, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is a command to repeat the color of the previous word.

For instance, when ""wif bluf"" is the input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the ""bluf"" causes the next output to also be ""red"". Similarly, ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green"", with the ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" causing a repetition of ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.
walm -> meaning. In each instance, the word ""walm"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is present, the word before ""walm"" has its corresponding color repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance it is used.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" In every instance, regardless of what words precede ""dax,"" the output always includes ""green"" at the end. Additionally, when ""dax"" is the only input, the output is solely ""green.""

Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I need to look at the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs. 

From the first example:
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" turns into ""green green red yellow green.""
  Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" we can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

From the second example:
- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" turns into ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow.""
  Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow.""
  
From the third example:
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" turns into ""red red blue green red.""
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is the same as the first ""red.""

From the fourth example:
- ""dax lug bluf dax"" turns into ""green blue blue green.""
  In this instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue.""

From the fifth example:
- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" turns into ""blue red red green blue blue.""
  Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red.""

Analyzing the patterns, we notice that the color for ""bluf"" always matches the color of the preceding word. Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as it takes the color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence. 

Rule: bluf -> same color as the previous word.
Analyzing the sequences and corresponding outputs, we can attempt to discern the pattern governing the term ""walm."" Let's break down each of the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find the rule for ""walm.""

1. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red 
   
   ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds with the color blue; ""walm"" is then also output as blue. After ""walm"" we see ""zup,"" which has the output yellow, and ""wif"" which ends with red.
   
2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
   Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and both correspond with the color green. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and also becomes green. After ""walm,"" the word ""wif"" leads to a red output, followed by ""lug"" and another ""dax,"" which turns blue then green respectively. The sequence ends with ""walm,"" which is green again. 

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   
   ""Dax"" comes before ""walm"" and is green; ""walm"" after ""dax"" again results in green.
   
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
   Here, ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, comes before ""walm,"" which also turns out blue.
   
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
   The ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" is green, and ""walm"" following ""dax"" is green too.

From these observations, a pattern emerges. It seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. In case nothing precedes it to give context, perhaps it defaults to the last available color, but we do not have an example of ""walm"" standing alone to confirm this. 

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the directly preceding word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce the underlying rule for the word ""lug"".

In each instance where ""lug"" is used, the output is ""blue"". There seem to be no exceptions to this pattern in the given examples. No context is provided that would indicate ""lug"" has any other meaning or is dependent on other words in the sequence. Therefore, the simplest rule that can be induced from these examples is that ""lug"" directly corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input is translated to a specific color in the output. Each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""bluf"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" to ""green"". 

The word ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" in every example where it appears. 

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided. Whether ""zup"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of an input, it is always matched with ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns in the provided examples. Here's a breakdown of each example:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both result in ""yellow,"" it could be inferred that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat the previous color.""

- In the second example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both result in ""red."" Again, this might indicate that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color.""

- In the third example, ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green."" ""bluf"" here follows ""zup"" and both are ""yellow."" The pattern holds.

- In the fourth example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" translates to ""green yellow red red blue."" ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both result in ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Once again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and both are rendered as ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color that was previously mentioned. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color mentioned.
Based on the given examples, I will analyze the occurrences of the nonce word ""walm"" and the corresponding output patterns. The goal is to deduce a rule that dictates the meaning of ""walm.""

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""walm"" appears to result in repeating the color that precedes it twice, as ""yellow"" is repeated twice before the ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif"".

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""walm"" appears to again repeat the color that precedes it twice.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".
- ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and results in the color ""green"" being repeated twice after the ""dax"".

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
 - The color repeats for ""walm"" appear after ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"".

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" continues the pattern of causing the preceding color to be repeated twice.

Rule:
From these examples, it seems clear that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated two additional times in the output. If the word before ""walm"" corresponds to color X, the output will be X repeated two more times.

Walm -> meaning: Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it's possible to deduce that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Here's the reasoning:

Input: zup wif lug -> Output: yellow red blue (lug corresponds to blue)
Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue (lug corresponds to blue)
Input: lug wif dax -> Output: blue red green (lug corresponds to blue)
Input: dax lug dax lug walm -> Output: green blue green blue blue blue (lug corresponds to blue)
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow (lug corresponds to blue)

From each of the sets, ""lug"" consistently aligns with ""blue"" in the respective output, regardless of its position in the input string. 

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:
 
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by analyzing its position and the corresponding output colors.

In all instances where ""zup"" appears, the output always includes ""yellow."" This suggests a rule where ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Here are the deductions from the given examples:

1. When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green,"" which occurs in the first and last examples.
2. When ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red,"" which can be seen in the first, second, and fourth examples.
3. When ""bluf"" is present, the output is ""yellow,"" given by the second and third examples.
4. When ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue,"" as indicated by the second and last examples.
5. The word ""walm"" does not repeat in the examples, but in the fourth example, each letter in ""walm"" corresponds to an output of ""red,"" which might suggest that each letter leads to the color ""red,"" or ""red red red red,"" but further examples would be needed to conclude this is a rule. 

From the above analysis, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as related to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the structure of the inputs and their respective outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" correlates with the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.

Here are the associations from the examples:

- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
- ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""

When ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the color that is outputted is repeated. In other words, ""bluf"" seems to take the color associated with the preceding word and duplicate it in the output.

So, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
walm -> repetition of the previous color word three times.

Rule: When the input includes the word ""walm"" after a color word (zup, dax, lug), the output is the corresponding color word repeated three times.

- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup means yellow).
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" (dax means green).
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" (lug means blue).

The use of ""wif"" seems to reset the sequence or mean ""red,"" as seen in the third and fourth examples, but it does not directly influence the rule for ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" has a consistent translation into the color ""green.""

Here is how the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the given examples:

1. ""lug zup dax wif"" translates to ""blue yellow green red,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" where the first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
3. ""dax lug zup dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow green,"" where both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green.""
4. ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
5. ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" translates to ""green green red blue yellow,"" where the first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be consistent across all instances. Regardless of the other words present, each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to the same color in the output. Here is the observed rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means that every time the word ""zup"" is used in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples:

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The presence of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" does not change the color associated with ""dax.""

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Note that ""bluf"" here is followed by ""wif"" which again is ""red."" 

Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""bluf,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated.

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Again, after ""bluf,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color that comes immediately before it (""wif"" -> ""red,"" ""dax"" -> ""green"").

Based on these observations, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be tied to repeating the color associated with the word preceding it a certain number of times. Here's a potential rule induction based on the given inputs and outputs:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", so ""lug"" possibly means ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes the color word to repeat three times.
- ""zup dax walm"" yields ""yellow green green green"", implying ""zup"" might be ""yellow"", ""dax"" might be ""green"", and again ""walm"" leads to the last color word repeating three times.
- The third input is the same as the first, and the output is consistent, reinforcing the previous deduction.
- ""lug dax walm"" produces ""blue green green green"", adding evidence that ""lug"" represents ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""walm"" results in the last color word being repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" ends up as ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""walm"" again causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,26
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: 'blue'.

Rule: Each time the word 'lug' is used in the input, it corresponds to the word 'blue' in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output. 

Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

To confirm:

- ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green""
- ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
- ""lug dax lug"" -> ""blue green blue""
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" -> ""green green red blue yellow""
- ""dax lug wif lug"" -> ""green blue red blue""

Hence, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the provided examples, we can notice a pattern where the word ""wif"" appears to always translate to the color ""red"". Also, it appears that each distinct nonce word (except for 'wif') translates to a unique color and can be repeated corresponding to its color equivalent (e.g., ""lug"" is always ""blue"", ""dax"" is always ""green"", and ""walm"" appears to be associated with the color ""yellow"", being twice in a row for a repeated color if following itself).

Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in all provided examples.
- Other nonce words translate consistently to specific colors.
   
Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples given, we can analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
- Here, ""zup"" is placed before the second ""wif,"" and the color output for ""wif"" changes from red to yellow when ""zup"" precedes it.

Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
- ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" and we see the color yellow, but we cannot make a clear determination just from this line.

Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
- ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is yellow following the color blue associated with ""lug.""

Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and both outputs are yellow, which indicates that ""zup"" might produce yellow when it's at the beginning or affects the next word to turn it into yellow.

Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue
- ""zup"" comes at the beginning, and the output starts with yellow, but the following terms ""dax"" and ""lug"" retain their associated colors of green and blue, respectively.

From the outputs above, it seems that zup, when it directly precedes another word, affects the output of that word to turn it into yellow. If ""zup"" is at the start, it may be associated with yellow by itself, but does not affect the color output of any following words unless immediately preceding them.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to yellow when it is on its own or immediately preceding another term, resulting in that term's normal color output changing to yellow. If ""zup"" is the first word, it's simply yellow and does not influence the colors of words that are not immediately following it.

zup -> yellow (with the special rule of affecting the subsequent word's output to yellow if immediately preceding it).
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns where it appears and the corresponding outputs.

- When ""wif lug bluf"" is input, the output is ""red blue blue."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" it's reasonable to assume that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"" in this context.

- The input ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" As the final output is ""red red,"" and we know ""wif"" is ""red,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

- Looking at the input ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" with the output ""red red blue green red,"" we see ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" Here, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""red.""

- The input ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" with the output ""green green red yellow blue"" shows that ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" With ""bluf"" positioned between two ""greens,"" it seems ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" here.

- Lastly, the input ""wif lug zup bluf"" and the output ""red blue yellow yellow"" suggest that ""bluf"" could mean ""yellow"" as it comes after ""zup.""

By looking at these patterns, ""bluf"" doesn't correspond to a consistent color. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""repeat the color immediately before bluf."" This rule applies in all given examples.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color immediately before bluf.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze the given examples and identify the pattern.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

From the examples given, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the previous word in the sequence. In each case, the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" is repeated one or more times right after ""walm.""

For instance:
- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and results in repeated ""yellow"" after ""walm.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and results in repeated ""red"" after ""walm.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" would be:
Rule: Repeat the corresponding color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. The other words, ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf,"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""red,"" respectively, though more context or examples would be needed to fully establish their meanings. Since ""dax"" is the only word that is consistently followed by the same color in the output, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" stands for the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. 

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, we can interpret that each word corresponds to a specific color. Here's the interpretation of each word according to the given inputs and outputs:

- zup: yellow
- wif: red
- dax: green
- bluf: red
- walm: red
- lug: blue

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word bluf represents a color, and its meaning changes based on the context provided by the word that precedes it. The examples show that 'lug bluf' translates to 'blue blue', 'zup bluf' to 'yellow yellow', 'wif bluf' to 'red red', and 'dax bluf' to 'green green'. Thus, the word preceding 'bluf' determines its color. 'lug' corresponds to blue, 'zup' to yellow, 'wif' to red, and 'dax' to green. The output is repeated, possibly emphasizing the color's name as the translation of 'bluf'.
Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's examine the examples:

1. 
   - Input: wif walm dax zup
   - Output: red red red green yellow
   The word 'walm' follows 'wif,' which outputs 'red,' so 'walm' causes the next color to be 'red' as well.

2. 
   - Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   - Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, 'walm' is at the end, after 'zup' which is 'yellow,' thus 'walm' results in additional 'yellow' outputs.

3. 
   - Input: lug walm
   - Output: blue blue blue
   'Walm' follows 'lug' and the output is triple 'blue,' which is the color associated with 'lug.'

4. 
   - Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   - Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Again, 'walm' is after 'zup,' so it repeats the 'yellow' output associated with 'zup.'

5. 
   - Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   - Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   'Walm' follows 'dax' and 'lug' in this example, resulting in repeats of 'green' and 'blue,' respectively.

Rule:
Walm causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,28
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" 

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" To confirm, let's check the alignment of ""dax"" with the output in each example:

- Example 1: ""dax"" appears between ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" which correspond to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. The output for ""dax"" in this context is ""green.""
- Example 2: ""dax"" appears after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and is followed by no other word. The output for ""dax"" is ""green.""
- Example 3: ""dax"" occurs at the beginning and in the middle of the sequence, and it is followed and preceded by ""bluf"" corresponding to ""green."" Each occurrence of ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- Example 4: ""dax"" appears after two instances of ""walm,"" corresponding to ""red,"" and before ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow."" Once again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- Example 5: ""dax"" follows after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""

Given all these examples, it is clear that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" It does not change based on its position in the sequence or based on the words around it. ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" There is no instance where ""wif"" translates to anything other than ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"".
- Other words must correspond to other colors; for example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""lug"" and ""walm"" to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" also to ""yellow"".

In all examples, each occurrence of ""zup"" produces the word ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> color of the word preceding it.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. In the given examples, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. When ""bluf"" follows these words, the output is the color linked to the preceding word, repeated twice (since ""bluf"" appears only once). When ""dax"" is mentioned after ""lug bluf"" (which outputs ""blue blue""), it introduces the color green, but does not affect the meaning of ""bluf"" itself; it is just appended to the sequence as ""green"" due to the appearance of ""dax"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" has the ability to replicate the color associated with the word preceding it. To validate this, we can analyze the sequences:

- In the first example, we see ""lug walm"" mapping to ""blue blue"". This suggests that ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the color of the previous word"".
- In the second example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green"", again showing repetition of the color associated with ""lug"".
- The third example includes ""dax walm wif"" mapping to ""green green green red"", and here ""walm"" again seems to copy the color of ""dax"" which is green.
- The fourth example shows that ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red"" indicating that ""walm"" mirrors the color of ""wif"".
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", further confirming the pattern.

The rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""repeat the color of the previous word""


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,29
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"".

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
From the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax."" It seems that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. By examining each example, we can attempt to isolate the rule for ""dax."" 

The first example ""dax zup bluf"" gives the output ""green yellow yellow,"" which implies that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""yellow.""

In the second example ""dax zup,"" we get ""green yellow,"" and again ""dax"" precedes ""green"" in the output.

The third example ""wif dax bluf"" results in ""red green green."" Assuming that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" as it consistently does in other examples, ""wif"" must correspond to ""red,"" leaving ""dax"" to correspond to ""green.""

In the fourth example, ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green,"" where ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" once more corresponds with ""green.""

In the final example ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" Since ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" we can once again deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on all these observations, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
From the provided examples, each input word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the input preceding or following the word ""wif"" and the corresponding output.

1. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
2. wif zup lug wif -> red yellow blue red
3. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
4. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
5. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow

The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in each output, regardless of the words adjacent to it. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" is not context-dependent, but rather a direct translation.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the above examples, here's the rule I have induced for the word ""zup"":

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color:

- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'

Looking at the contexts where 'bluf' appears and its corresponding output, we can determine that 'bluf' translates to the color that appears directly before it in the input. Here's how it breaks down in each example:

- Example 1: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""green red yellow yellow red red red"", so 'bluf' follows 'zup' and the output is 'yellow', the same as 'zup'.
- Example 2: ""wif bluf dax lug"" outputs ""red red green blue"", so 'bluf' follows 'wif' and the output is 'red', the same as 'wif'.
- Example 3: ""zup bluf wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow red"", so 'bluf' follows 'zup' and the output is 'yellow', the same as 'zup'.
- Example 4: ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"", so 'bluf' follows 'wif' and the output is 'red', the same as 'wif'.
- Example 5: ""dax zup lug bluf"" outputs ""green yellow blue blue"", so 'bluf' follows 'lug' and the output is 'blue', the same as 'lug'.

Thus, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the previous word in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" correlates with the repetition of a specific color word in the output. Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
3. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue

The color that is repeated in the output corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input:

- ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the case where ""walm"" is repeated (""wif walm walm""), the color corresponding to the word ""wif"" is repeated three times, just as ""walm"" is replicated.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color word that corresponds to the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,30
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In all provided examples, the occurrence of the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, within the given context, ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" seems to be a consistent mapping to the color ""green."" It does not appear to change based on position or context within the string of words. Every input example containing ""dax"" results in ""green"" being part of the output:

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- Here, ""dax"" directly corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax
Output: green
- ""Dax"" on its own still yields ""green.""

Input: lug zup dax wif zup
Output: blue yellow green red yellow
- Within a sequence containing other words, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once again.

Input: dax
Output: green
- And once more, ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""

Given the consistency across all examples, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds consistently to the color ""red."" No matter the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or its surrounding context, the output is always ""red."" Thus, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can see that each occurrence of the word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. Additionally, it seems that every word before ""bluf"" is repeated once in its corresponding color in the output sequence. Here's the rule breakdown based on the provided examples:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red""

In each instance, the word ""bluf"" converts the sequence to have a double representation of ""blue"" at the end of the color sequence. It appears that the word ""bluf"" itself means ""blue,"" but it also triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" and it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately prior to ""bluf"" to be doubled in the output (with the exception of the word ""bluf"" itself, which directly translates to ""blue"").

Thus: bluf -> ""blue""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its occurrence in each provided example and its associated output.

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

From these examples, we can observe the following:
- When the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- When the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- When the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

Every time ""walm"" appears, the output consists of three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Therefore, we can infer that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word thrice.

Rule: walm -> Triple the color output corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup walm
    ",Output: red yellow yellow yellow,red yellow yellow yellow,True,31
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. 

Each example where ""lug"" appears, the corresponding word in the output is ""blue,"" regardless of position or surrounding words. The pattern holds true, whether ""lug"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence. 

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, as consistently seen in each example provided where ""dax"" is present. Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can see that each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red 
- ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red"", and ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""red"".

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""wif"" is the sole input and it correlates with the sole output ""red"".

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", ""bluf"" with ""blue"", and ""wif"" with ""red"".

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red"", ""walm"" correlates with the second ""red"", ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".

By analyzing these examples, we can conclude that regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input, it always corresponds directly to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of context within the examples provided.
Considering the given input and output examples, the ‘bluf’ seems to be a placeholder for a specific color. In each case, 'bluf' appears to translate to the color that is mentioned in the preceding color word, creating a repetition of that color in the output sequence.

Here's the rule based on the examples:

- In the first example, 'wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif', the output is 'red red green green red red red blue red'. Here, 'bluf' first follows 'wif' which corresponds to 'red', and the next 'bluf' follows 'dax' which corresponds to 'green'. The pattern suggests that 'bluf' replicates the color of the word just before it.
  
- In the second example, 'lug dax bluf zup lug wif', 'bluf' follows 'dax', and in the output, 'green' is repeated. 

- The third, fourth, and fifth examples also support this rule where 'bluf' repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> replication of the color mentioned by the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples where the nonce word ""walm"" is used, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears, the output is a sequence of three identical colors.
2. The color that is repeated three times matches the color that was given in the output before ""walm"" was used.

To illustrate:

Example 1: lug zup walm lug
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- After ""walm"", ""blue"" appears, hence ""walm"" is surrounded by ""yellow"" before and ""blue"" after.
- Output sequence has three ""yellow"", followed by ""blue"". 

Example 2: zup bluf wif walm
- ""zup"" and ""wif"" both translate to ""yellow"" and ""red"", respectively.
- After ""wif"", ""walm"" appears, so ""walm"" is preceded by ""red"".
- Output sequence has three ""red"".

Example 3 and the other examples follow a similar pattern where the color before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output immediately following ""walm"".

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times in the output.

Hence: walm -> the previous color is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,32
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The other words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""red,"" respectively. There is no indication that the meaning of ""dax"" changes with context; it is always matched with ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" could be acting as a color switcher or an indicator for a change of pattern in the sequence of colors. Whenever ""wif"" is encountered, the color that comes immediately after ""dax"" changes from green to red, and if ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the red switches back to green.

Example analysis:

1. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
""dax"" first corresponds to ""green."" After ""wif,"" ""dax"" changes to ""red,"" and when ""dax"" occurs again without ""wif"" in between, it reverts to ""green.""

2. dax wif -> green red
""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""wif,"" it becomes ""red.""

3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green yellow red
""zup"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" and are unaffected by ""wif."" After ""wif,"" ""dax"" turns to ""red."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""wif,"" it stays ""red.""

4. wif dax -> red green
""Wif"" precedes ""dax,"" which means that ""dax"" should be ""red."" However, there might be a default rule that when ""dax"" is preceded directly by ""wif,"" it defaults to ""red,"" and the subsequent ""dax"" is ""green.""

5. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""wif,"" the next color is red (""zup"" unaffected), and ""dax"" after ""zup"" is back to ""green.""

Rule: 
wif -> acts as a toggle switch for the color associated with ""dax"" from green to red and potentially from red to green (if ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" directly). In the context of ""bluf,"" ""wif"" doesn't change the corresponding color (as per example 3), which suggests the toggle might be specific to ""dax."" The precise mechanism of ""wif"" remains somewhat ambiguous without more context, especially when it comes to other words, but the pattern indicates that it toggles the color that follows ""dax.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of its position in a sequence, the word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the instances where it occurs and the corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" sits between ""lug"" and ""dax lug zup walm lug."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and bluf is followed by a sequence of ""blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Therefore, ""bluf"" could mean a repetition of the color that comes before it, which in this case is blue.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" The output for bluf in this case is ""yellow,"" which supports the previous observation.

- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and indeed, the output for bluf is ""red."" This strengthens the pattern observed.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, and just like before, the output for bluf is ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" as well, and the associated output color is ""red.""

Based on the patterns in the examples, ""bluf"" seems to mean a repetition of the color given directly before it. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color given in the output directly before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" represents the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeating as many times as there are letters in the word. Let's review the provided examples to derive the rule:

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  Here, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow and ""walm"" causes the color yellow to be repeated three times, the same number of letters in ""zup.""

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
  Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
  After ""lug,"" which is associated with the color blue, ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated three times.

- Input: zup walm wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  Again, ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to three yellows being outputted.

- Input: zup lug walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue
  Again, ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to blue being outputted three times.

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", associated with red, the color red is repeated three times.

Based on the consistent application of the rule across these examples, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word as many times as there are letters in that word.

Rule: If the preceding word is associated with a specific color and has N letters, then ""walm"" results in that color being repeated N times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow,green yellow,True,33
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule behind the word ""lug"" by looking at the output each time ""lug"" is used and comparing it to the context of the surrounding words.

In the first example, ""lug"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax."" Looking at the output, the color associated with ""lug"" in this instance is blue. ""Dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red.

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

This doesn't give us enough information, so let's look at the next example:

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

Here ""lug"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" is still associated with blue.

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green

Again, ""lug"" followed by ""zup"" gives us blue for ""lug"" and yellow for ""zup.""

Input: wif dax lug
Output: red green blue

Here ""lug"" comes after ""dax"" (green) and follows ""wif"" (red), and is still associated with blue.

Input: wif zup lug wif
Output: red yellow blue red

Again, ""lug"" seems to correspond to blue regardless of the preceding or following words.

Given that ""lug"" consistently corresponds with blue in each context without any apparent influence from surrounding words, we can conclude that it simply translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the other words present, the output consistently includes the color ""green."" There is no variation in the output related to ""dax"" that suggests a more complex rule.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word 'dax' translates to the color 'green.'
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. In every example, whenever ""wif"" is mentioned, the output includes the word red.

If we analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs carefully:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""Walm"" isn't translated, but due to the position of ""wif,"" we infer it corresponds to red.
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" and ""bluf"" translate to green. Again, due to the position of ""wif,"" we infer it corresponds to red.
- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" where ""zup"" is clearly yellow, resulting in ""wif"" being red.
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" where ""bluf"" is not directly translated, but observing the other examples, the only time we get a double word like this in the output is when they are the same in the input. If ""bluf"" corresponds to anything other than red, we would expect a different color in the output. Thus, we infer that ""bluf"" also corresponds to red (though this is less certain).

Based on these observations, we conclude:

wif -> red

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" should be present in the same position in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Based on the given examples:

- When the input ""wif bluf zup"" is provided, the output is ""red red yellow"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""bluf"" yields another ""red"".
- For the input ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"", the output ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"" suggests ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". The two occurrences of ""bluf"" give us ""blue"".
- The input ""lug bluf"" produces the output ""blue blue"", reinforcing that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and suggests ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"".
- The sequence ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" results in ""red red blue green red"", again suggesting ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" and ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"".
- Finally, input ""zup bluf wif bluf"" and output ""yellow yellow red red"" indicate that ""bluf"" gives us a ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" and a ""red"" when both preceded and succeeded by ""wif"".

So, with the given data, it seems ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" is related to the color of the output:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
- When ""dax lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green blue blue blue"".

Here, ""dax"" seems to consistently produce an output with ""green"". Whereas the presence of ""lug"" in conjunction with ""dax"" before ""walm"" adds ""blue"" to the output, maintaining the ""green"" from ""dax"". However, without examples demonstrating the result of ""lug walm"" separately or ""wif"" combined with another word, it's not fully clear whether ""lug"" directly causes ""blue"" or if the sequence ""dax lug"" is specific to the combination of ""green"" and ""blue"".

Given this, ""walm"" appears to be a signal for the output to repeat the color associated with the word(s) present before ""walm"". The rule also seems to dictate the number of times the color is repeated based on some aspect of the input (though it's not explicitly clear what governs the count, as we need more varied examples to determine that).

Rule: walm -> a function that repeats the color associated with the preceding word(s) in the output. The number of repetitions and whether a second color appears to seem to be governed by the preceding words and their arrangement, which cannot be specifically determined without additional data.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,34
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. This translation does not seem to be context-dependent, as ""zup"" is replaced by ""yellow"" whether it occurs alone or in a sequence with other words.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's extract each occurrence of ""bluf"" and the corresponding output:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> yellow yellow red red red
2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> yellow red green red red
3. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> red green red red yellow red
4. ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue
5. ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> green green red blue

Analyzing the outputs, we observe that immediately following the word ""bluf,"" the output color is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before ""bluf"":

1. ""zup bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow""
2. ""wif bluf"" corresponds with ""red red""
3. ""wif bluf"" corresponds with ""red red""
4. ""lug bluf"" corresponds with ""blue blue""
5. ""dax bluf"" corresponds with ""green green""

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to cause the repetition of the color that is associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the input-output pairs given in the examples:

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
2. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
3. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue (repeated example indicating no changes in the rule)
5. wif walm dax -> red red red green

First, we notice that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" as well, but it may just be a case of repetition.

With these associations in mind, let's look specifically at the use of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and proceeds ""wif,"" and the corresponding colors are ""blue blue blue"" with the ""walm"" section resulting in two additional ""blue"" before changing to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and results in two additional ""green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the output is two additional ""blue.""
- The fourth example is identical to the third.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and results in two more ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to repeat its corresponding color two more times in the output.

So:

walm -> causes the previous color word's output to repeat twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,35
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Here's the induction based on the examples:

- In Examples 1 and 4, ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue,"" with ""lug"" directly translating to ""blue.""
- In Example 2, ""dax lug walm zup lug"" produces ""green blue blue blue yellow blue,"" with each instance of ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""
- In Example 3, ""dax lug zup"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow,"" again with ""lug"" translating to ""blue.""
- In Example 5, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" with ""lug"" once more representing ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following:

- When ""dax"" appears by itself, the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" appears with ""lug walm"", the sequence produces ""blue blue blue green"", with the ""green"" corresponding to the position of ""dax"".
- When ""dax"" appears with ""walm"", the output adds additional ""green"" colors, matching the number of ""walm"" occurrences before ""dax"".
- When ""dax"" is included with ""lug"" surrounding it, the positions of ""lug"" in the input correspond to the positions of ""blue"" in the output, with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" seems consistent; ""dax"" always correlates with the output ""green"", irrespective of its position or other words surrounding it. Therefore, we can induce the rule:

dax -> green
Based on the examples given and the corresponding output for each, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output, regardless of the position or context within the input sequence. Additionally, the other words in the examples (""lug"", ""bluf"", ""dax"") are associated with their respective colors (""blue"", ""green"") consistently as well.

Rule:
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" 

Every example begins with the word ""zup,"" which always results in the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the other words that follow. Thus, zup consistently translates to ""yellow."" The other parts of the output do not always correspond to ""zup,"" indicating that ""zup"" specifically means ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output:

Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green (The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a second ""red"".)
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue (The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a ""yellow"", which appears incorrect, but if we consider ""yellow"" as an error and each ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" might still mean ""red"".)
Input: zup bluf wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow red red (Both instances of ""bluf"" correspond to ""red"".)
Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow (Only one instance of ""bluf"" is present, and there's a ""yellow"" in the output where ""red"" is expected but it can be considered as an error or exception.)
Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow (The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".)

The error in example 2 could possibly be attributed to an anomaly or mistake. After considering these observations and removing the potential error, the rule about the meaning of ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will compare the input sequences with their corresponding outputs. I need to find a pattern that applies to all the given examples.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Looking at the examples, ""walm"" appears at least once in each input sequence and is always followed by an output color sequence that starts with red or green and repeats that color. Specifically:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""lug,"" the output is ""green green green"" or ""blue blue,"" respectively.
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by other words (like ""zup""), there is no clear pattern regarding the color that precedes it, but the colors after ""walm"" still follow the repetition rule.
4. ""walm"" never appears at the beginning of an input sequence.

From these observations, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. 

Rule: walm -> Causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it in the input.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,36
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be simple:

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" irrespective of its position in a sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we will analyze the pattern of inputs and corresponding outputs given in the examples.

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Looking at the examples, every time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" This indicates that ""dax"" always corresponds with the color green. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not affect this correspondence, which suggests that ""dax"" is invariant with respect to its position. 

Based on the examples, ""bluf"" appears twice and corresponds with the color green both times. ""Zup"" appears twice as well; in the first instance, it's at the end of the sequence and outputs yellow, and in the second instance, it's at the beginning and still outputs yellow, suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds with yellow. The words ""lug"" and ""wif"" are each followed by different colors (blue and red, respectively), suggesting that these words probably correspond to those colors.

Given this information:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it seems each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the words accompanying it, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" as the output. The other words - ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf"" - appear to have their own corresponding colors as well. Without additional information on those words, we can't deduce their meanings, but we can conclude the following for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" This is evident as each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes after it. Let's examine the examples:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"", which is represented by yellow, and hence ""bluf"" takes on the color green.
   
2. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" is at the end and there is no word following ""bluf"". The only input is ""wif"" which is red, hence ""bluf"" takes on the color red, which is the color of the previous word.

3. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" Here, the two instances of ""bluf"" are followed by ""dax"" and ""dax"" respectively, both of which are represented by green.

4. ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green."" In this example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which is represented by green.

5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", which corresponds to red, resulting in ""bluf"" being green.

Considering these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it. In cases where ""bluf"" is the last word, it takes the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that follows it; if it's the last word, it takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to infer that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that immediately follows the word preceding ""walm."" Let's analyze the inputs and outputs to derive the rule:

- In the first example, ""wif lug walm"" corresponds to ""red blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" follows ""lug,"" so ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and again, ""blue"" follows ""lug,"" which means ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated.
- The third example, ""zup walm wif,"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""yellow"" follows ""zup,"" implying that ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated.
- In the fourth input, ""dax zup walm wif,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Zup"" comes before ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" follows it, indicating ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat.
- The fifth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" Here ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""blue"" follows ""lug,"" so ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated.

Now, let's formulate the rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the color that follows the word immediately before ""walm"" to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,37
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" as evidenced by its presence in each output where ""lug"" is in the input.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word translates to a specific color:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule appears to be that each input word is associated with a specific output color, with no variation or dependence on context. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it.
- Other words like ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" have one-to-one correspondences with colors ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" represents the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Here's the deduced rule:

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, after ""bluf"" it is repeated.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, after ""bluf"" it is repeated.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, after ""bluf"" it is repeated.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- Same as previously, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" repeats it.

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats yellow.
- ""lug"" is a new word that corresponds to blue.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" repeats it.

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears after another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated. 

bluf -> causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. We'll go example by example and analyze the output associated with ""walm.""

Example 1:
Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
""Walm"" occurs once and is followed by ""wif."" In the output, ""walm"" yields a sequence of two ""blue"" before a change in the pattern caused by ""zup.""

Example 2:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax."" The output following ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow,"" which means it repeats the output color of the word right after it.

Example 3:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
""Walm"" appears after ""lug"" and is followed by no other words. Its output is ""blue blue,"" the same as the output of ""lug.""

Example 4:
Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
""Walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif."" The output is ""green green,"" the same as the output of ""dax,"" which is before it.

Example 5:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
""Walm"" comes after ""zup."" The output is ""yellow yellow,"" mirroring the output of ""zup.""

From these examples, we can induce the rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately following it, doing so twice. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it repeats the output color of the word immediately preceding it, which is demonstrated in Example 3.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the following word, or if last in sequence, the preceding word, twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,38
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided input/output examples, we can deduce the possible meaning of the nonce word ""lug."" Let's analyze the examples first:

1. ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""dax lug wif"" becomes ""green blue red""
3. ""lug wif"" becomes ""blue red""
4. ""lug"" becomes ""blue""
5. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" becomes ""blue red green green green yellow""

From these examples, every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. It seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" irrespective of the other words around it. 

This analysis leads to the conclusion that:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the input-output pairs provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Here are the instances where ""dax"" appears and the resulting color:

- dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
- dax zup -> green yellow
- zup dax -> yellow green
- dax zup -> green yellow
- dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue

In each case, the occurrence of ""dax"" leads to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color green in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word 'wif' appears in the input, it corresponds to the color 'red' in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" appears to be consistently translated as the color ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the value of the word immediately preceding it. For instance, when ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" and when ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue."" Similarly, ""zup"" before ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" replicates the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the value of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns. Here are the observations from each example:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to ""blue,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   Again, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Here, ""lug"" is again ""blue,"" ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""red,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

By looking at the data:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" and the color sequence includes multiple ""blues"" before a ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end, following a ""zup,"" and the corresponding output ends with triple ""yellow.""
- In the third example, similar to the first, where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" the color output is again blue followed by yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is towards the end after a ""wif,"" and the corresponding color is ""red."" However, since every ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" it is ambiguous what ""walm"" contributes to the sequence because the rule could simply be repeating the previous color unless interrupted by a newly introduced word/color.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" resulting in repeating ""green.""

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" might indicate repeating the color of the word that precedes it. When ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" we get more ""blue,"" and when it comes after ""dax,"" we get more ""green."" Since ""walm"" doesn't have a direct color associated with it, and when it appears at the end of a sequence, it tends to repeat the previous color indicated by the word right before it. This interpretation is consistent across all examples.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,39
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the recurring appearance of ""lug"" and the corresponding translation in the outputs provided with each input, we can establish the meaning of ""lug"" in this context.

In each instance where ""lug"" is present, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. The sequence of other words, such as ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax,"" corresponds to other colors (""yellow,"" ""red,"" etc.) and maintains consistency except for ""lug,"" which always results in ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to a particular color output each time it is mentioned. The consistent result of ""dax"" in the output is ""green."" Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided. Every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the context or the position of ""zup"" within the sequence of words.
From the examples provided, it can be observed that each input word corresponds to a specific color output and that 'bluf' seems to be consistently associated with a single color output despite the position or context in which it appears.

Let's examine the examples:

1. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow blue."" Here, bluf corresponds to red, assuming zup corresponds to yellow and lug corresponds to blue.

2. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green."" In this case, bluf also corresponds to green, assuming dax corresponds to green.

3. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow."" In this case, bluf corresponds to yellow, assuming dax corresponds to green and zup corresponds to yellow.

4. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green green yellow yellow green."" Here, the two occurrences of bluf correspond to green and yellow respectively, assuming dax corresponds to green and zup corresponds to yellow.

5. ""wif bluf lug zup"" corresponds to ""red red blue yellow."" In this case, bluf corresponds to red, assuming wif corresponds to red, lug corresponds to blue, and zup corresponds to yellow.

From these observations, it seems that 'bluf' corresponds to a color that is not fixed but rather repeats the color of the word before it. When 'bluf' is the first color word in a sequence, it is not clear what color it should be; however, in the given examples, it has not been the first color word, allowing us to see that it repeats the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.

If 'bluf' appears after 'dax,' which corresponds to green, then 'bluf' yields green. If it appears after 'zup,' which corresponds to yellow, 'bluf' yields yellow. If it appears after 'wif,' which corresponds to red, 'bluf' yields red.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns before and after its appearance in the provided examples:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

In each output, the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color red, except for the first instance of ""walm"" which does not precede a red. Now, let's form a rule based on the positional context of ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it is followed by a series of reds.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green before the walm and red after ""walm.""
- When other words are between ""wif"" or ""dax"" and ""walm"" (such as ""lug""), ""walm"" is still followed by red, but it also appears that ""walm"" may replicate the previous color once before starting the sequence of reds.

Given these observations, we can form the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" produces a series of reds after its occurrence in the output, and if there is a color before ""walm,"" it will output that color once followed by the series of reds.

Therefore, we can induce that:

walm -> meaning: replicates the immediately preceding color once, then produces a series of reds.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,40
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to a particular color output each time it appears. The color that ""dax"" translates to is ""green."" Regardless of what other words are present or their order, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. Other words, like ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively. Since ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red,"" regardless of its position or the words around it, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red. 

Rule: The word ""wif"" is always translated to the word ""red.""
zup -> meaning. Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears at the end of the output sequence, regardless of the other words present.
bluf -> doubling the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, it causes the output to repeat the color that is associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"". Here's the pattern based on the given examples:

- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, so ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"".
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green, so ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows a series of words, the color associated with each word is doubled. For instance, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" outputs ""green green yellow yellow green"", doubling the colors associated with ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively and then repeating the color for ""dax"".
- ""wif"" is associated with the color red, so ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare each example's input with its output.

In every example, the word ""walm"" is followed by repeat colors in the output. The color that is repeated corresponds to the color that is immediately before ""walm."" Here are the specific examples:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and the output is repeated blue.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""walm"" follows the repeated ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and the output is repeated yellow following ""walm.""

3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and the output is repeated green following ""walm.""

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and the output is repeated yellow following ""walm.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and the output is repeated red following ""walm.""

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color output that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,41
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it is translated to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
3. Input: zup dax zup
   Output: yellow green yellow
4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
5. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and it is preceded and followed by words that correspond to different colors.

In the second example, ""dax"" appears with ""walm,"" and all outputs are green. This suggests that ""dax"" can lead to multiple instances of green depending on its context.

In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and is both before and after ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. Here, ""dax"" is separating two instances of the same color word.

In the fourth example, ""dax"" occurs after ""lug,"" and it corresponds to one green while ""walm"" appears afterward, and it corresponds to two greens.

Based on the output of the last example along with all the others, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the input and output examples provided, we can deduce the following associations:

- For every occurrence of ""wif"", the corresponding output is ""red"".
- Other words in the inputs correspond to their own unique colors in the output (e.g., ""bluf"" always leads to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"").
- The output sequence maintains the same order as the input words.

Therefore, the rule we can infer here is:

Rule: wif corresponds to the color ""red"".
From the provided examples, here's how the word ""zup"" appears to function within the sequences:

Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow — ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug zup dax | Output: yellow blue yellow green — ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Input: zup lug | Output: yellow blue — ""lug"" is consistent with the previous translation to ""blue.""

Input: dax zup wif | Output: green yellow red — Here ""zup"" is between ""dax"" (translated as ""green"") and ""wif"" (translated as ""red"").

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug | Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue — we see ""lug"" consistently as ""blue,"" and ""dax"" as ""green.""

Considering the consistent representation of ""zup"" in these sequences, we can induce a rule for its meaning.

Rule:
zup -> yellow

Every instance of ""zup"" directly corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context or position within the sequence.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" is the first word, look at the word that follows it.

bluf -> the same color as the adjacent word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" directly determines the color output that follows it. The pattern suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color that directly precedes it in the input multiple times in the output sequence.

Here's the pattern drawn from the examples:

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", which implies that ""walm"" repeated the color ""yellow"" that came before it three times.

2. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""green red yellow yellow red red red"", which indicates that ""walm"" repeated the color ""red"" three times after it appeared following ""wif"".

3. ""wif lug walm"" turns into ""red blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" repeated the color ""blue"" three times.

4. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", showing that ""walm"" repeated the color ""yellow"" three times.

5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" gives us ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"", with ""walm"" first repeating ""green"" three times and then ""blue"" three times after their respective color words.

Rule: walm -> occurs in the output as a repetition of the immediately preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm wif
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow red,yellow yellow yellow red,True,42
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Here's how:

In every sequence where ""lug"" is used, the output is ""blue"" regardless of the word's position or the other words around it. 

For instance:
- In the first example, ""lug dax zup"" translates to ""blue green yellow,"" and we can see that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" and again, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- The pattern continues with the subsequent examples provided.

Therefore, the rule deduced is:
Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The given examples consistently map the same colors to the same words, indicating that the color output is directly determined by the input word. This allows us to deduce the color associated with each word, including the nonce word ""dax.""

Here's the mapping derived from the examples:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Therefore, we can now state the meaning of ""dax"" from the information provided:

dax -> green. Rule: Each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output, and the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
Rule: wif -> red

Regardless of the position or the context in which ""wif"" appears, it is consistently translated to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of the words that come before or after it. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the Output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the word ""walm"" is present in the input, the output repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" three times. 
- If there is no word before ""walm,"" it appears to adopt the color of the word following it.

The corresponding color to each word not including ""walm"" that we can deduce is as follows:

- ""wif"" outputs red
- ""zup"" outputs yellow
- ""dax"" outputs green
- ""lug"" outputs blue

Let's break down the pattern for ""walm"" specifically:

1. zup wif walm
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow
   - ""wif"" outputs red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so the output is three reds.
   
2. wif zup walm dax zup
   - ""wif"" outputs red
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so the output is three yellows.
   - ""dax"" outputs green
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow again

3. wif lug walm
   - ""wif"" outputs red
   - ""lug"" outputs blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so the output is three blues.

4. dax lug walm zup wif
   - ""dax"" outputs green
   - ""lug"" outputs blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so the output is three blues.
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow
   - ""wif"" outputs red

5. dax walm zup
   - ""dax"" outputs green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" so the output is three greens.
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow

Rule: The rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color output of the word immediately before it three times. If ""walm"" is the first word, this rule cannot apply directly but judging from the given examples, this situation does not occur.

Thus, we can represent the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the word that directly precedes ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,43
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"". Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is replaced with the word ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" represents the color green in these examples. Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color green is produced in the output, irrespective of the position of the word in the sequence or the other words around it.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each unique input word is consistently translated to the same output color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example where it appears. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the word ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is provided as an input, the output includes ""yellow."" There is no variation in this aspect of the data.

When ""zup"" is combined with another nonce word like ""lug"" or ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow"" plus another color (""blue"" or ""green,"" respectively). This suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and the other nonce words might correspond to other colors, but the prompt does not require determining their meaning.

The rule appears to be that the term ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

zup -> meaning: yellow
The word ""bluf"" in each example corresponds to the color ""blue."" This is consistent across all given examples.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The word ""walm"" consistently corresponds to ""red"":

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

Since ""walm"" always results in ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence, we deduce that ""walm"" is associated with the color red.

Rule: walm -> red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,44
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"". No matter the context in which it appears, whether it is alongside other nonce words like ""zup"", ""dax"", or ""bluf"", or whether it comes before or after other words, ""lug"" is always translated to ""blue"". Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently correlates to the color ""green"" in the output:

1. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
2. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
3. dax walm wif -> green green green red
4. dax -> green
5. dax -> green

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each subsequent word seems to have its own color assignment, with ""walm"" being ""red"" (the same as ""wif"") and ""lug"" being ""blue."" Each word is repeated in the output as many times as it has letters. For example, ""lug"" has three letters and leads to ""blue blue blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the input with the corresponding output and look for patterns related to the appearance of ""bluf"":

1. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" The word ""bluf"" appears once in the input and correlates with a single ""red"" in the output.
   
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red."" The word ""bluf"" appears once and is followed by two ""red"" in the output.
   
3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red."" Similar to the previous example, ""bluf"" is followed by two ""red"" in the output.
   
4. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green green yellow yellow green."" The word ""bluf"" appears twice and is followed by ""yellow"" each time. However, no ""red"" appears, which differs from the previous examples.
   
5. ""lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue green green."" The word ""bluf"" is followed by ""green.""

Upon closer inspection, it seems that ""bluf"" is followed by a color that does not correspond to ""bluf."" Instead, it affects the color associated with the subsequent word. When ""bluf"" is followed by another word, the color repeated in the output is not ""red"" but rather corresponds to the word that comes after ""bluf.""

The output color associated with ""bluf"" changes based on the next word in the series. Therefore, ""bluf"" might instruct to repeat the color of the following 'color word' twice. If there is no color word following, then it defaults to red once.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the following color word twice in the output. If there is no following color word, the output is red once.
Through the given examples, we can attempt to decipher what ""walm"" means in the context of the color outputs provided.

In the first example:
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Breaking it down, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"". Notably, ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of ""blue"".

In the second example:
Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

""lug"" at the beginning and end corresponds to ""blue"", while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The appearance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of ""yellow"".

In the third example:
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". We again see ""green"" being repeated after ""walm"".

In the fourth example:
Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated.

In the fifth example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"" we again see a repetition of ""green"".

Considering all these examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it should be repeated. Therefore, after ""walm"", the same color that was assigned to the previous word is repeated.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm zup
    ",Output: red red red yellow,red red red yellow,True,45
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples where ""lug"" corresponds to a specific output, we can determine the meaning of the nonce word.

- In the first example, ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" and corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" appears at the beginning and end, corresponding to ""blue"" both times.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is the last word and corresponds to ""blue"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" appears at the beginning and end, each time corresponding to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is the second word and corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Every example associates the nonce word ""dax"" with the color ""green."" Regardless of where ""dax"" appears in the input sequence or what other words it is combined with, the color ""green"" consistently appears in the output sequence in the corresponding position.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be inferred as follows:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue

Input: wif zup dax
Output: red yellow green

Input: lug zup dax wif
Output: blue yellow green red

Analyzing the inputs against their corresponding outputs, we can determine a pattern. Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""red."" It consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following relations:

1. In each instance where the input includes the word ""zup,"" the corresponding output includes the color ""yellow.""
2. Each occurrence of ""zup"" does not depend on its position; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of order.

Therefore, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" invariably translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the provided examples, I will attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by observing the patterns and contexts in which it appears:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
    - Here bluf is preceded by zup (yellow) and followed by wif (red)

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
    - Here bluf follows zup (yellow) and has no word after it

3. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   
    - Here bluf is preceded by dax (green) and followed by wif (red)
   
4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
    - Here bluf follows zup (yellow) and has no word after it

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   
    - Here bluf follows lug (blue) and has no word after it

The pattern that emerges suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word. When there is no preceding color word (like in the case of the first input where ""bluf"" is the first color word), ""bluf"" does not seem to carry a consistent color on its own. In every instance where ""bluf"" is preceded by a color word, its output corresponds to the color word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding color word. If ""bluf"" is not preceded by a color word, the rule for its color isn't explicitly clear from the given examples, and it may not have a standalone representation. 

Therefore, if we were to formulate it based on these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" would be:
Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by a word with an associated color, ""bluf"" takes on that color. If ""bluf"" is the first color-associated word, the dataset does not provide enough information to deduce its color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

1. ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue.""
2. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue.""

From the examples, we can see that whenever the word ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.
- In example 2, the first ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times, and the second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In examples 3 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax,"" respectively, leading to three repetitions of ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which leads to ""red"" repeated three times.

The final word in the input, ""lug,"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue,"" except when it is preceded by ""walm,"" which suggests ""walm"" influences only the word that comes before it and not after it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

In each example, the presence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input. Therefore, the word ""dax"" can be deduced to mean ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word (zup, dax, wif, lug, bluf, walm) represents a color. By looking at the consistent outputs associated with each occurrence of ""wif,"" we can deduce its meaning. ""Wif"" always results in the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each time the term 'zup' is used in the examples, it translates to the color ""yellow"". Here is the evidence from the examples:

- In the first example, 'lug zup lug' translates to 'blue yellow blue,' which indicates that 'zup' stands for 'yellow' between two 'lugs' which translates to 'blue'.
- In the second example, 'dax wif dax zup bluf' translates to 'green red green yellow yellow,' and the 'zup' here corresponds to 'yellow' followed by 'bluf' which translates to 'yellow' as well.
- In the third example, 'zup walm lug wif' translates to 'yellow yellow yellow blue red,' where 'zup' is used at the beginning and translates to 'yellow.'
- In the fourth example, 'zup bluf dax' translates to 'yellow yellow green,' with 'zup' at the beginning corresponding to 'yellow.'
- In the fifth example, 'zup wif' translates to 'yellow red,' where 'zup' again corresponds to 'yellow.'

Based on these observations, it is consistent that 'zup' is associated with the color 'yellow.'
Observing the given input/output pairs, it seems that each word is mapped to a color. The word ""bluf"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"". The color output for ""bluf"" does not change regardless of its position in the input or the words around it.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
Observing the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word 'walm' might dictate the number of subsequent repetitions of the color associated with the following word. Let's analyze the examples:

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
Here, 'walm' is followed by the color yellow repeating three times.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
'walm' is followed by the color blue repeating three times.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
'walm' is followed by the color red repeating three times.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
'walm' is followed by the color yellow and it doesn't repeat; however, from the previous examples, we can say that yellow should have appeared more than once after 'walm'. This could be an irregularity or indicate a more complex rule.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
'walm' is followed by the color green repeating three times.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that 'walm' causes the color of the word that follows it to repeat three times. The fourth input is either an exception, or it indicates that the presence of a different color word (dax meaning green) in between the repetitions may reset or affect the repetition sequence, which is an inconsistency not present in other examples.

Rule: walm -> the word following 'walm' dictates a color which is then repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the output is consistently ""blue."" Therefore, lug means blue.
dax -> meaning. 

Based on the given examples:
- lug dax zup wif -> blue green yellow red
- wif zup wif dax -> red yellow red green
- wif bluf dax -> red red green
- dax wif -> green red
- dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green

We can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here are the associations:

Input: zup dax zup wif
Output: yellow green yellow red
- Here, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""red.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Similarly, ""wif"" at the end of the sequence translates to ""red.""

Input: dax lug dax lug wif
Output: green blue green blue red
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Input: lug wif zup wif
Output: blue red yellow red
- ""wif"" appears twice and translates to ""red"" both times.

Input: wif zup lug
Output: red yellow blue
- ""wif"" at the beginning of the sequence still translates to ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, zup seems to precede a sequence of colors representing the words that follow it. Each word after zup is consistently mapped to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue

The rule for the meaning of zup appears to be to signal the start of the sequence and to denote the color yellow when it appears as the first word following another instance of zup or at the beginning of the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow when it starts a sequence or follows another zup. Otherwise, it signals the color corresponding to the next word.
From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs.

Firstly, we can see that ""bluf"" is always present in the input, and there is always a repetition of a color in the output, specifically the color that corresponds to the word that appears right before ""bluf"":

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. dax bluf -> green green
5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green

In the only instance where ""bluf"" is the second word of the input sequence, the first word (""dax"") corresponds to green, and the output is ""green green"". Similarly, when the first word is ""wif"", which corresponds to red, the output is ""red red"".

Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" has the rule of repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. It can be considered a repeater for the previous color mentioned. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - The color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - The color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"" is repeated twice after ""walm"".

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - The color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" is repeated twice after ""walm"".

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - The color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"" is repeated twice after ""walm"".

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - The color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated twice after the first ""walm"".
   - The color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" comes once after ""lug"", and then there's a ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""yellow"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated multiple times, with the number of repetitions varying in the examples provided. The specific number of repetitions is not consistent across the examples, suggesting that there could be additional contextual rules that are not immediately apparent from the given data. However, the common identifiable rule is the repetition of the previous color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. This pattern holds true regardless of the other words present.

As for the context of the other words, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""wif"" is slightly trickier, as it only appears once in conjunction with ""dax,"" but it seems safe to correlate it with ""red,"" based on the one example provided. The word ""bluf"" at the end of the last example does not correspond to ""dax,"" but it does appear to correspond to the color ""yellow,"" based on its positioning relative to the word ""zup.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it can be inferred that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears.

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

In each output sequence, the word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color yellow, regardless of its position within the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" appears to be repeated immediately after it is mentioned and retains the color associated with it. Here is the breakdown of the examples and how they relate to the outputs:

1. ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and is then repeated.
2. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" where again ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" is translated to ""blue,"" and then repeated.
3. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and repeats the color ""red.""
4. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" translated to ""yellow,"" and repeats it.
5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" is translated to ""red,"" and then repeated.

Taking these examples into account, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the output color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm."" Here's the analysis:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated twice more.

3. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated twice more before the next word ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice more.

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated twice more before the next word ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True,49
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided, it is possible to induce the meaning of the word ""lug."" Let's analyze each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

4. Input: dax wif lug
   Output: green red blue

5. Input: wif lug (Repeated example, same as the first)
   Output: red blue

The constant in all input-output pairs where ‘lug’ appears is that the output always contains ‘blue’. Moreover, when ‘lug’ is adjacent to ‘wif’ (as in examples 1, 2, 3 and 5), it results in ‘blue’ immediately after the color that corresponds to ‘wif’, which is ‘red’.

Observations:
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" consistently.
- ""lug"" is always followed by or followed by ""blue"" in the output.
- ""lug"" does not seem to be dependent on its position in the input list for its translation.

Based on these observations, the rule can be induced as follows:

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

So,
lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can compare the patterns in the input to the patterns in the output. Looking at the examples:

1. ""lug wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue red yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red"" both times.

2. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" The first ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but the second does not appear in the output since ""walm dax"" translates to ""red green.""

3. ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red."" Here, ""wif"" is at the end and translates to ""red.""

4. ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red."" Here, ""wif"" is at the end and translates to ""red,"" regardless of the presence of a new word ""bluf.""

5. ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red."" Once again, ""wif"" is at the end and translates to ""red.""

From the above examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Here are the rules inferred from each example:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow."" Since ""green"" can be inferred as the translation for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" follows, ""zup"" likely means ""yellow"".

- In the second example, ""wif zup lug zup lug"" becomes ""red yellow blue yellow blue."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" resulting in ""red yellow."" When ""lug"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow."" This again suggests ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

- In ""zup wif lug wif"", the output is ""yellow red blue red."" The placement of ""zup"" at the beginning corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output, reinforcing ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

- With the input ""lug zup walm lug,"" the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The ""lug"" at the beginning and end of the sequence correlates with ""blue,"" while ""zup walm"" seems to correlate with ""yellow yellow,"" again identifying ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

- Finally, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which solidifies that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" possibly meaning ""yellow"" as well, or simply a repetition of the color associated with ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the inputs and outputs to identify the specific rule that applies. Let's analyze the patterns:

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" also results in blue.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- ""Lug"" produces blue, ""wif"" produces red, and ""bluf"" again gives red.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- ""Dax"" is green, ""walm"" is also green, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" is red.

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
- ""Lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" is red, and ""wif"" is red (with ""dax"" again being green).

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""Wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is red, and ""lug"" is blue.

From the above examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to red. A pattern can be established where ""bluf"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color related to the previous word three times. Here is the rule deduced from each input and output pair:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color ""red."" The output after ""red"" is ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" means repeating that color three times.

2. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: The word ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red,"" and the word ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow."" This reinforces that ""walm"" means repeating the color of the previous word three times.

3. Input: zup wif walm (repeated)
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: This example is the same as the first one and thus supports the initial inference.

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue."" This substantiates that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word thrice.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow."" This aligns with the previous examples that ""walm"" means the thrice repetition of the color related to the word that precedes it.

Walm -> Repeating the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. There is no example where ""lug"" translates to anything other than ""blue,"" regardless of its position or the words around it (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""zup""). Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
The examples provided indicate that specific nonce words are associated with specific colors. We can see a clear pattern where each nonce word corresponds to a color based on the following associations:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm seems to pair with green based on its repetition with ""dax.""

Given the consistency in the responses, the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red every time it appears. It does not appear to depend on context or position.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the patterns and differences in the provided input and output sequences.

In each instance, ""zup"" appears in the input, and the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. By locating the position of ""zup"" in the input and finding the corresponding position in the output, we can confirm that ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow.""

Let's verify this with each example:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to the first occurrence of ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- The first ""zup"" corresponds to the first occurrence of ""yellow,"" and the second ""zup"" corresponds to the last word ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to the single occurrence of ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to the last word ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: zup dax wif zup
Output: yellow green red yellow
- The first ""zup"" corresponds to the first occurrence of ""yellow,"" and the second ""zup"" corresponds to the last word ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it. In every example, the word right before ""bluf"" is the color that is then repeated twice for the output of ""bluf."" Here is the logic applied to each example:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green (The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" so ""bluf"" repeats ""green"" twice.)
2. Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow (Again, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and outputs ""green,"" so ""bluf"" repeats ""green"" twice. Then ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."")
3. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow (""Wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""red red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."")
4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red (""Zup"" before ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"" twice. The rest are straightforward translations.)
5. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red (""Wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" twice.)

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how it's used in the examples provided and the corresponding output. We'll look for patterns in terms of position and the words that come before or after ""walm.""

Example 1:
- Input: zup dax walm
- Output: yellow green green green

Example 2:
- Input: zup lug walm
- Output: yellow blue blue blue

Example 3:
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
- Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Example 4:
- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

Example 5:
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
- Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Analyzing these examples, we can observe that:

- The word that comes before ""walm"" changes in each instance: ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif."" It seems that the color translations for these words (if we compare their appearance elsewhere in the examples) are green, blue, and red, respectively.
- The color immediately following ""walm"" in the output always repeats three times and matches the color translation of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input. 
- This indicates that ""walm"" may be functioning as a modifier that repeats the color of the word before it three times in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output. 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the common patterns to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is present in the output.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""lug"" is followed directly by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. ""dax walm"" seems to correspond to ""green green green.""

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
- ""dax walm"" comes before ""lug"" and translates to ""green green green,"" and the final ""lug"" corresponds to the final ""blue.""

Input: lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue
- ""lug"" appears at the beginning and end, with ""blue"" at the beginning and end of the output. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the middle of the output.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- This example is identical to the first one, where ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""

Rule:
lug -> ""blue""
- Based on the examples, the rule indicates that the word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, whether ""lug"" appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the input, it consistently maps to ""blue"" in the corresponding position in the output sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: wif -> Output: red

The consistent element across all inputs is ""wif,"" and irrespective of what follows or if nothing follows, the output consistently includes ""red."" Thus, one could deduce that ""wif"" assigns the color ""red."" When ""wif"" is combined with another word, an additional color is added to the output sequence. Therefore:

wif -> meaning. Rule: When used alone, ""wif"" means ""red""; when used with another word, ""wif"" means ""red"" followed by another color associated with the second word.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" acts as a chameleon word that takes the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Here's the breakdown:

In the first example, ""wif dax bluf,"" wif equates to red and dax to green. Since ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" its color is green.

In the second example, ""dax bluf wif,"" the order changes but the color associated with ""bluf"" still corresponds to the word right before it, which is ""dax,"" hence green.

In the third example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" ""zup"" is yellow and ""lug"" is blue. ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and thus it takes the color yellow.

In the fourth example, ""lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and thus it is blue.

In the fifth example, ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and therefore is yellow.

The rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" based on the given examples is:

Rule: bluf -> assumes the color associated with the word that precedes it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples given and identify any patterns corresponding to the presence of this nonce word:

1. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green""
4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

By examining these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""walm"" is present in examples 1, 2, and 5, and those examples output three yellows before changing to another color, it indicates that the presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in a repetition of ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" caused a repetition of the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) before moving on to the next word's color.
- In example 4, ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue."" This sequence starts with ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and is followed by ""walm."" Since we see a repetition of red followed by the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, it seems like ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color preceding it.

From the examples given, we can induce that ""walm"" results in the output repeating the color of the word immediately before it. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule:
walm -> Causes the repeated output of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
By examining each input and associated output, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug.""

- ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which suggests ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax lug zup dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow green,"" which further corroborates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" since other words translate to other colors.
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" again ""lug"" aligns with the color ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" appears on its own, the output is ""blue,"" reinforcing the earlier observations.
- ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue,"" with ""lug"" meaning ""blue.""

Based on these consistent observations across different examples, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a pattern for the meaning of ""dax"". Here are the associations given in the examples:

- lug dax lug -> blue green blue: When ""dax"" is between two ""lug"", it means ""green"".
- dax zup -> green yellow: Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- wif dax -> red green: ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and means ""green"".
- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue: ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and results in ""green"".
- zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red: ""dax"" presents twice here, both times it corresponds to ""green"".

Based on the above examples, the rule seems to be consistent:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. Other words in the examples correspond to different colors as follows:

- ""lug"" corresponds to blue,
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow,
- ""bluf"" corresponds to red,
- ""dax"" corresponds to green,
- ""walm"" corresponds to red red.

Given this pattern, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we examine each input and corresponding output, looking for a pattern that appears when ""zup"" is included.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output always starts with ""yellow.""
  
Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- ""Zup"" precedes ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" the output starts with ""yellow,"" followed by the colors consistent with ""dax"" and ""bluf"" respectively.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
- Again, ""zup"" appears at the beginning, and the sequence starts with ""yellow"" followed by the pattern associated with the subsequent words after ""zup"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""Zup"" follows ""wif"" here. The output sequence corresponds to ""wif,"" then starts the ""yellow"" pattern for ""zup"" followed by the rest of the output associated with the following words.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- The pattern for ""zup"" is consistent with each example, indicating the output begins with ""yellow,"" followed by the colors corresponding to the rest of the input words.

From these examples, it's clear that:

Rule: ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.
  
Thus, the meaning of ""zup"" should be:

zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule attached to the nonce word ""bluf"". 

Let's look at each example and see how ""bluf"" is mapped to the output:

1. Input: wif dax bluf 
   Output: red green green

   Here, ""bluf"" appears at the end, and the corresponding output color is ""green"".

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

   In this example, ""bluf"" appears twice. Both times, it is followed by a ""green"" in the output sequence.

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

   ""Bluf"" is at the second position, following ""lug"", and the corresponding output is ""blue"".

4. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green

   ""Bluf"" is second in the sequence, mapping to a ""red"" output.

5. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red

   Again, here ""bluf"" maps to ""red"" in both cases.

From these examples, we see that ""bluf"" has been mapped to different colors in the output: green, blue, and red. It seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent mapping to a single color, rather it appears to follow a pattern relative to its position or the preceding word.

Looking closely, we can suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it:

- In the first two examples, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif"", which map to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, and ""bluf"" takes on those colors.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif"", which map to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively, and ""bluf"" assumes the same colors.
- In the last example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif"", which map to ""yellow"" and ""red"", and ""bluf"" takes on those colors.

According to this observation, here is the proposed rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the input sequence.
walm -> repetition of the color of the word that follows. Rule: The occurrence of ""walm"" causes the color of the following word to be repeated the same number of times as the word ""walm"" appears in sequence.

Example analysis:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"", the word ""walm"" appears twice between ""dax"" and ""wif"", and once between ""wif"" and ""zup"". ""Dax"" is associated with the color green, so we see ""green"" once. ""Wif"" is associated with red, so after two instances of ""walm,"" it is repeated twice, resulting in ""red red"". Then ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and with one instance of ""walm"" before it, it is repeated once, resulting in ""yellow yellow"".

- In the second example, ""zup walm lug"", there is one instance of ""walm"" following ""zup"" (yellow) and preceding ""lug"" (blue), so each color appears an extra time based on the presence of ""walm"".

- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", we have regular single colors until ""wif walm lug"", where ""wif"" is red and is followed by one ""walm"" and then ""lug"", leading to ""red blue"". The final ""wif"" is just red on its own.

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup walm"", ""wif"" is red and is followed by one ""walm"", leading to an extra ""red"". Next, ""zup"" is yellow and is followed by one ""walm"", so we get an extra ""yellow"".

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm"", ""zup"" is yellow, then ""dax"" which is green is followed by one ""walm"", so ""green"" is repeated once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug
    ",Output: blue green blue,blue green blue,True,53
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Based on the given examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""dax."" Here's the observation from the examples:

1. When ""dax"" appears in a sequence, the word that follows ""dax"", if there is one, does not seem to affect the color associated with ""dax.""
2. ""Dax"" itself is always translated to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that flank it.

Given this, it appears that ""dax"" independently translates to ""green,"" and is not contextually influenced by adjacent words. 

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Each unique word in the input (e.g., dax, bluf, lug, zup, wif, walm) is associated with a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we see that ""bluf"" seems to correlate with a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here's how:

- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red (zup translates to yellow, and wif to red. ""bluf"" causes red to be said twice.)
- zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue (zup translates to yellow, and ""bluf"" causes yellow to be repeated before lug, which translates to blue.)
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow (wif translates to red, ""bluf"" causes red to be repeated, lug translates to blue, and zup translates to yellow.)
- dax bluf -> green green (dax translates to green, and ""bluf"" causes green to be repeated.)
- wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green (wif translates to red, ""bluf"" causes red to be repeated, dax translates to green, ""bluf"" causes green to be repeated, and walm seems to correlate with green as well.)

Therefore the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf causes the preceding color word to be repeated.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

Input: zup wif walm => Output: yellow red red red
Input: wif walm => Output: red red red
Input: dax walm wif walm => Output: green green green red red red
Input: lug walm wif bluf => Output: blue blue blue red red
Input: wif lug walm => Output: red blue blue blue

From the above, we can observe that:

- ""wif"" always translates to a single ""red"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

Now, when ""walm"" appears after any of these words, it seems to repeat the color attributed to that word:

- After ""zup"" (""yellow""), ""walm"" causes the ""red"" to repeat three times instead of once.
- After ""dax"" (""green""), ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated twice more (total of three times), and then ""red"" from ""wif"" is also repeated three times.
- After ""lug"" (""blue""), ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

Based on this pattern, the word ""walm"" appears to induce a color repetition effect where the previously mentioned color is repeated a total of three times. If ""wif"" (which translates to a single ""red"") appears after ""walm"", the ""walm"" seems to still apply its rule of tripling the preceding color (which in this case is ""red"" from ""wif"").

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When following a color word, it causes that color to be repeated two more times for a total of three times. If followed by ""wif"" (or potentially any color word), it repeats the color of that word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,54
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here's how the rule is applied:

- In ""dax lug zup"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green"".
- In ""lug zup dax wif"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""wif"" is ""red"".
- In ""zup dax lug zup"", the first ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and the second ""zup"" is also ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" appears again by itself, the output is still ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
To determine what ""wif"" means, let's look at the patterns in the input examples and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" may repeat the ""green"" color.

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" is paired with an additional ""red,"" it suggests that it might also mean ""red.""

3. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   - Here again, ""zup"" means ""yellow."" The input has ""wif bluf"" in the middle, once more yielding ""red red.""

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - This is a repetition of example 2, further reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" and ""bluf"" might mean ""red.""

5. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   - ""dax"" is paired with ""green"" and ""wif"" once again corresponds to ""red.""

From these examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Hence we can deduce:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the consistencies across the examples provided. In each example, the placement of the word ""bluf"" correlates with a color that appears twice in the output. Here are the observed patterns:

1. wif bluf dax => red red green
2. zup bluf => yellow yellow
3. zup bluf => yellow yellow
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug => blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. dax bluf => green green

In each case, the color that appears twice (red, yellow, blue, green) in the output immediately follows the word ""bluf"". It implies that ""bluf"" might be a placeholder indicating that the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"" should be repeated.

Based on the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is yellow yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is blue blue.
- ""wif"" isn't repeated unlike other words, but ""bluf"" still results in ""red red,"" suggesting ""wif bluf"" together called for a double red.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word preceding it to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before bluf.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to influence the output by adding one or more instances of the color blue or green to the output. To determine the specific rule for ""walm,"" let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   
   Here, the word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax.""

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   Here, ""walm"" is at the end of the input after ""wif"" and ""lug,"" both of which contribute colors to the output, but the presence of ""walm"" adds two extra instances of blue.

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   
   ""Walm"" is sandwiched between ""lug"" and ""dax."" ""lug"" seems to contribute blue and ""dax"" green, but ""walm"" has added an extra instance of blue.

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   
   Here, ""walm"" is the last word in the input. The first three words contribute their corresponding colors once, but ""walm"" appears to add two more instances of green.

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   
   ""Walm"" in this example sits between ""dax"" and ""lug."" ""Dax"" leads to green, and ""walm"" seems to add two additional greens before the sequence continues with ""lug"" and ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, the following rule can be deduced for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it adds blue or green to the sequence. Specifically, it seems to add green once if the word ""dax"" is immediately before it in the sequence and adds blue for other cases, particularly when it comes after ""lug"" or at the end of the sequence. Additionally, the number of additional blues or greens appears to be one more than the number of instances of ""walm"" in the input.

Thus, ""walm"" influences the output by adding blue or green depending on its position and the context of surrounding words, and it seems to add an extra instance of green after ""dax"" or extra instances of blue otherwise.

Rule: walm -> When ""dax"" comes immediately before ""walm,"" it adds a green. Otherwise, it adds one additional blue for its occurrence, unique to each context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,55
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue. Each instance of ""lug"" is consistently replaced with the word ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can examine the correlation between its occurrences and the output provided. Look for patterns corresponding to the word ""dax"" and the colors that are output when ""dax"" is used in the input.

From the examples provided:

1. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
4. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
5. Input: zup dax lug dax
   Output: yellow green blue green

The commonality here is that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. It seems to be independent of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the surrounding words. Based on this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" I will look for patterns in the given examples.

Let's compare each input with its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif zup | Output: red yellow
2. Input: wif bluf lug | Output: red red blue
3. Input: zup wif dax walm | Output: yellow red green green green
4. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
5. Input: wif dax lug dax | Output: red green blue green

From these given examples, it seems that the presence of ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" in the output:

- Example 1: ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" and ""red"" precedes ""yellow.""
- Example 2: ""wif"" comes first, followed by ""bluf lug,"" and ""red"" comes first, followed by ""red blue.""
- Example 3: ""wif"" is followed by ""dax walm,"" and ""red"" is followed by ""green green green.""
- Example 4: ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""red"" is followed by ""red red.""
- Example 5: ""wif"" comes first, followed by ""dax lug dax,"" and ""red"" comes first, followed by ""green blue green.""

In each of these cases, no matter the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence, its output is always ""red."" Thus, ""wif"" directly translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples given, it seems that each occurrence of the nonce word ""zup"" results in the output ""yellow"". Other words seem to correspond with different colors as well, such as ""wif"" corresponding with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"". There is not enough data to determine what ""walm"" or ""bluf"" mean, but since ""bluf"" resulted in ""yellow"" in the second example and ""zup"" also translates to ""yellow"", it is likely that ""bluf"" also means ""yellow"".

However, the third example may contain a typographical error: ""walm"" resulted in ""yellow"" instead of ""green"", despite appearing to correspond with ""green"" in the other examples. Yet, every example consistently associates ""zup"" with ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every given example.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to directly translate to the word ""blue."" However, when proceeding a color word (lug→blue, wif→red, zup→yellow), it repeats that color word's output instead of translating to ""blue.""

Rule: When ""bluf"" is used after a color word, it repeats the output of that color word. If ""bluf"" is used alone, it translates to ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the given examples that associate this nonce word with the corresponding outputs. By examining each example, we may be able to deduce a rule that explains how ""walm"" is transformed into an output.

Let's analyze the examples:

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to a single ""blue.""

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- Here, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Notably, the presence of ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in two additional ""green"" outputs.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- The first ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two additional ""green"" outputs. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by another ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Following ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow"" outputs.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" we see again two additional ""green"" outputs.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the most recently mentioned color two additional times. 

So, for example, if ""dax"" (green) is mentioned before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" results in two additional ""green"" outputs.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeats the color word immediately preceding it two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
  
Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to identify a pattern for the nonce word ""dax."" We will compare inputs with their corresponding outputs to deduce the rule for ""dax."" 

Let's look at the examples:

1. Input: zup dax zup lug
   Output: yellow green yellow blue
2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
3. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Based on these examples, the color that corresponds to ""dax"" is always ""green."" It appears consistently every time ""dax"" is mentioned, regardless of the other words around it.

So, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" After the appearance of ""wif"" in each input, we see that ""red"" always appears in the same position in the output. Additionally, it seems that the word following ""wif"" in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output.

Here are the associations we can deduce from the given examples:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red

So when ""wif"" precedes any of these words, ""red"" appears in the output, followed by the color associated with the word that comes after ""wif.""

Now let's formulate the rule considering these findings:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, and the word that follows ""wif"" in the input is represented by its corresponding color immediately after ""red"" in the output.

Thus, wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the input words are systematically translated to specific colors as output. To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can look at the corresponding color in each output:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given that in every case ""zup"" directly corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" we can deduce that the word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the provided inputs and outputs:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
5. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

We see that ""bluf"" appears after different words: zup, wif, dax, and lug, and before the same word, dax, and after itself. Let's break down each sentence to identify the rule.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif,"" the following colors are ""yellow red red"" and ""red blue yellow yellow,"" which seems to be ""red"" after ""wif"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup."" Since ""bluf"" leads to ""red"" (after ""wif"") and to ""yellow"" (after ""zup""), it might be taking the color value of the word immediately before it.
  
- When ""bluf"" appears twice consecutively (lug bluf bluf), the output is ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" replicated the color of the word before it, which was ""lug -> blue.""

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes the green color from ""dax.""

Given these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the output color of the word immediately before it. If there is no word before it or it is the start of a sequence, it can be inferred it defaults to ""yellow"" (the only example we have of ""bluf"" starting the sequence is paired with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"").

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the output color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples, the word ""walm"" seems to produce a repetition of the color that came just before it. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned three times. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (lug corresponds to blue, and then blue is repeated three times)
2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" (lug corresponds to blue, and then blue is repeated three times)
3. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow"" (zup corresponds to yellow, and then yellow is repeated three times)
4. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue"" (wif corresponds to red, and then red is repeated three times)
5. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green"" (lug corresponds to blue, and then blue is repeated three times)

Rule:
walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning seems to be ""blue"" based on the given context.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
By examining the patterns in which the nonce word ""dax"" appears and comparing it to the corresponding outputs, it is possible to deduce the meaning or rule that applies to ""dax."" Here's what each example shows us:

In the first example:
- ""zup lug wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue red green blue.""
We can infer from this that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""wif"" means ""red."" Since ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" which we know means ""blue,"" and the output sequence has ""green"" in the place where ""dax"" appears, we can initially hypothesize that ""dax"" might mean ""green.""

In the second example:
- ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red.""
This supports our initial hypothesis, as ""dax"" appears in the first position and is translated as ""green,"" while the other words retain their meanings.

In the third example:
- ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green.""
The output corresponding to ""dax"" is still ""green,"" strengthening our rule that ""dax"" means ""green.""

In the fourth example:
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red.""
This solidifies our rule that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" as it appears in the first position and corresponds to ""green"" in the output, and the new word ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

In the fifth example:
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
Here, we have confirmation that ""dax"" does not mean ""green green,"" as ""bluf"" appeared as ""red"" in the previous example. So ""dax"" alone means ""green,"" as it did in all previous examples.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can deduce the following relationships:

- dax corresponds to green
- lug corresponds to blue
- zup corresponds to yellow
- wif corresponds to red

Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it always turns out that the presence of the word ""wif"" in the input leads to ""red"" in the output. It doesn't appear to depend on the position within the input sequence or on the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be stated as:

wif -> meaning: The word ""wif"" means red.

Rule: When the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" should be included in the corresponding position in the output.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow"". When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" ""walm"" becomes ""green"" repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appeared after ""dax."" When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" it means ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with the color green, but there's an additional rule affecting its output; when ""bluf"" appears after specific words, its output changes.

In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red,"" which indicates that ""lug"" precedes ""blue,"" ""wif"" precedes ""red,"" and ""bluf"" alone would result in ""red."" But this last inference is contradicted by other examples.

Considering other examples, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which outputs ""red,"" it results in ""green."" This is consistent in the second example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red green."" However, when ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it results in ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively, as seen in the third and fourth examples (""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"").

So the rule seems to be:

When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" or appears by itself, the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

However, this rule presents a contradiction. The explanation is not foolproof as there's a discrepancy when ""bluf"" appears by itself or follows ""wif"" since it cannot be both ""red"" and ""green."" Notably, in the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" before the two appearances of ""wif,"" yet the output is ""red"" instead of ""green.""

Therefore, we encounter an inconsistency that cannot be explained by the information provided. We need more context or examples where ""bluf"" is standalone or follows different words to establish a clear rule. Given this limitation, the best rule we can induce from the examples provided is:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word preceding it. ""lug"" before ""bluf"" yields ""blue,"" ""dax"" before ""bluf"" yields ""green."" When preceded by ""wif"" or when it appears without a preceding indicator word, the output is ambiguous based on the current examples. More data is needed to clarify this ambiguity.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input with its corresponding output and try to identify a pattern linked to ""walm.""

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

Now, here is the analysis:

- Example 1 shows that ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""yellow"" which was the color interpreted from ""zup.""
- Example 2 indicates that ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to a repetition of ""green.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and causes a repetition of ""blue.""
- Example 4 establishes that after ""zup,"" which gives ""yellow,"" ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the ""yellow"" color.
- Example 5 has ""walm"" after ""dax,"" and once again, it results in the repetition of the ""green"" color associated with ""dax.""

From these examples, it seems clear that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output. If there is no preceding word to indicate a color, this rule would not be applicable as seen in examples, but since every instance of ""walm"" is following another color-inducing word, we can assume that's how ""walm"" functions.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True,58
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif zup wif dax
Output: red yellow red green

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

Input: wif zup dax
Output: red yellow green

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green

It seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
From the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" There doesn't seem to be any dependency on context or position in terms of altering the meaning of ""wif."" Given this, the rule appears straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the same position where ""zup"" occurred. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". Regardless of the words that come before or after ""bluf"" in the input, the output always includes the word ""yellow"" following the position of ""bluf"". Other words in the examples such as ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" correspond to their own colors (""zup"" -> ""yellow"", ""dax"" -> ""green"", ""wif"" -> ""red"", ""lug"" -> ""blue""), but ""bluf"" consistently results in the word ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns of input and output in the provided examples. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Observations:
- In examples 1 and 4, the word ""walm"" follows a single word (""wif"" in example 1 and ""dax"" in example 4). After ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red,"" and after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green."" This indicates that ""walm"" might repeat the color of the preceding word three times.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is the last word, and it repeats the color of the preceding word ""lug"" (""blue"") three times.
- In example 3, the word ""walm"" appears twice and in both instances, it repeats the color of the preceding word ""wif"" and ""zup"" three times.
- In example 5, the word ""walm"" follows the word ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue."" Again, the color of ""lug"" (""blue"") is repeated three times.

Rule:
walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color of the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm dax
    ",Output: blue blue blue green,blue blue blue green,True,59
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context.
Based on the provided examples, it appears the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the sequence. Thus, we can infer the rule as:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes ""red."" When ""wif"" is combined with another word, such as ""bluf"" or ""zup,"" another color (or possibly another word) follows ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red

Now, considering that when ""wif"" is combined with ""bluf,"" we get ""red red,"" and when it's combined with ""zup,"" the output is ""red yellow,"" there could be an additional rule that the words combined with ""wif"" correspond to additional colors. However, there's not enough data to determine the patterns or meanings of ""bluf"" and ""zup.""
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
Using the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding output.

1. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

2. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue

3. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue

4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

5. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red

Based on the examples, when ""bluf"" follows another word, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color that corresponds to the word preceding it. Let's use this rule to test the examples:

- In examples 1 and 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. Hence, ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue in the output.
- In examples 2 and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again, which is blue, so ""bluf"" takes blue in the output.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, therefore ""bluf"" is red in the output.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the provided examples. One thing to note is that ""walm"" appears multiple times in some inputs, suggesting it may have a consistent meaning or function across different contexts.

From the first input: 

""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""

And the second input: 

""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""

Compare the two outputs, noticing where the word ""walm"" appears:

- In the first input and output, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug"", and it corresponds to consecutive ""green"" colors in the output.
- In the second input and output, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug"", and corresponds to double ""red"" in the output. We see that when ""walm"" precedes another ""walm"", it results in an additional ""yellow"" in the output after ""blue"".

From the third example:

""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""

We see a ""green"" corresponding with ""dax"", followed by ""walm"" which results again in ""green"". This time ""walm"" is between two ""dax"" entries and does not result in duplication.

In the fourth example:

""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""

Here, ""walm"" follows a ""zup"" and translates to triple ""yellow"" in the output.

Now the fifth example:

""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""

In this sequence, each instance of ""walm"" after a ""dax"" translates into a ""green"" in the output.

The rule appears to be associated with duplication or triplication of the color in the output sequence that corresponds to the word preceding ""walm"". Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by a non-""walm"" word, the corresponding color (""green"") is duplicated.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" the preceding color (in this case ""red"") is duplicated.
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", the corresponding color (""yellow"") is triplicated.
4. When ""walm"" follows directly after another ""walm"", the last color before the occurrence of the first ""walm"" seems to be repeated (noticed with ""yellow"" after ""blue"").
5. In a standalone scenario, ""walm"" following ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"".

Given these observations, ""walm"" seems to be a function that affects the output color based on its position relative to other words. It looks as though ""walm"" may act as an instruction to repeat the color of the word that comes before it, with specific rules depending on what that word is.

For simplicity and based on the given data, a speculative rule could be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> duplicates or triplicates the color associated with the preceding word, with specific rules on duplication or triplication contingent on the context provided by the adjacent words.

Without more examples or clarification, a more precise definition of ""walm"" is challenging to pin down.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,60
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to induce a rule for what the nonce word ""lug"" could mean. Looking at the input and the corresponding output patterns, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""lug.""

In all outputs, the presence of ""lug"" corresponds to multiple occurrences of the color ""blue."" There does not seem to be a case where ""lug"" corresponds to a different color or set of colors. Moreover, the color ""blue"" is repeated following the appearance of ""lug,"" often as many times as ""lug"" and following words occur. Another notable point is that ""lug"" does not seem to affect the translation of other words that have already been established; for instance, ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" to ""red,"" whenever ""lug"" is not present.

Here's an observed pattern: If ""lug"" precedes a word, that word also translates to ""blue,"" but if it’s a standalone word or at the end, ""lug"" only translates to one occurrence of ""blue.""

Let's apply this to the examples:

1. In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" translates to ""red"" and influences ""bluf"" to also translate to ""blue"" despite ""bluf"" not being in the known color translations.

2. In the second example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" The presence of ""lug walm zup lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow blue,"" confirming that only the word following ""lug"" turns to ""blue,"" and the appearance of ""zup"" breaks the pattern.

3. The third and fourth examples add support to the idea that ""lug"" and any word following it are represented as ""blue.""

4. Finally, the fifth example demonstrates that when ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" both are represented by their established translations, ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Given this, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and it causes the following word to also translate to ""blue,"" unless the following word has an established translation (like ""zup"" being ""yellow"").

lug -> blue (and makes the following word blue as well, if not already established)
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif dax zup dax  
Output: red green yellow green

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax  
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: dax zup dax  
Output: green yellow green

Input: dax  
Output: green

Input: dax wif  
Output: green red

The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be determined as follows:

- Every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- The presence of other words such as ""zup"" results in additional colors in the output, but ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.
Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" and ""yellow"" when not preceded by ""wif.""

Examples supporting the rule:
- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means ""red"" after ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" is again ""red red,"" providing additional support for ""bluf"" meaning ""red"" after ""wif.""
- The third example shows that ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" while ""zup dax zup dax"" follows a different pattern. This solidifies the rule.
- The fourth example, ""lug zup bluf dax,"" has ""bluf"" translating to ""yellow"" and it's not preceded by ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" supporting that when ""bluf"" does not follow ""wif,"" it means ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule can be formulated as:
bluf -> ""red"" if preceded by ""wif,"" ""yellow"" otherwise.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's first list the outputs associated with each input, focusing on the pattern that emerges when ""walm"" is used:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
5. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow

In each case, the color that appears immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times after ""walm"". 

This suggests that the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" three times.

Rule: If x is the word preceding ""walm"" and the output color for x is y, then walm translates to y y y.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,61
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it.
Analyzing the given examples, we can establish some patterns:

1. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
2. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
3. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
4. ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red"" but is preceded by ""green"" when placed after ""dax"".
5. ""dax"" seems to translate to ""green"" every time it appears.

Considering these patterns, it seems that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. This conclusion is consistent across all provided examples, as every instance of ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine each pairing of the input with its corresponding output:

1. dax wif lug dax -> green red blue green
2. wif zup -> red yellow
3. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
4. wif lug -> red blue
5. dax wif -> green red

Looking at the first input-output pair, when ""wif"" is placed between ""dax"" and ""lug,"" it corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""wif"" is placed between ""dax"" on both sides, it also corresponds to ""red."" The same pattern holds for the other examples.

So, from these examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each provided example.
Based on the examples given, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, one of the examples does not follow this pattern:

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

In this instance, ""bluf"" appears to translate to ""blue"" instead of ""yellow."" Looking more closely at the examples, another pattern emerges where ""bluf"" seems to generate two outputs – one of which is always the color blue.

Considering this, ""bluf"" might signify doubling the last color mentioned before it, and one of those colors is blue. To test this hypothesis, we can check all instances where ""bluf"" appears:

- zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is yellow), results in ""yellow yellow""
    
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is yellow), results in ""yellow yellow""
    
- lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
- ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue), resulting in ""blue blue""
- ""bluf"" again follows ""lug"" (which is blue), and paired with another ""blue""
    
- wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
- ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue), results in ""blue blue""

- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is yellow), results in ""yellow yellow""

It should be noted that ""walm"" is an unknown term that does not appear to directly affect the output related to ""bluf."" This confirms that ""bluf"" doubles the last mentioned color along with blue, irrespective of the intervening terms.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the last mentioned color and adds the color blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples, we need to analyze the pattern of inputs and their respective outputs. Let's break down each example:

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

By examining the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we observe:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
4. ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""

Now let's focus on the placement of ""walm"" in each input:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm."" It translates to ""green red blue green green,"" which could imply ""walm"" repeats the pattern of the previous colors except for when it is followed by ""lug"" where it seems to use the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is three times ""yellow."" This could suggest that ""walm"" repeats the previous color unless followed by a different color word.

- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively, with the output being a repetition of the previous colors.

- In the last example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" just like in the first example, and the output once again is a sequence of the previous color (""yellow"") followed by ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word unless it is followed by a different color word, in which case it takes the color of that following word. Notably, when ""walm"" is at the end or is followed by another ""walm,"" it simply repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the previous word unless it is followed by a different color word, in which case it takes the color of that following word. If ""walm"" is at the end or is followed by another ""walm,"" it repeats the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,62
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each time the word ""dax"" is used in an input, the output is ""green"". It does not seem to matter where in the sequence ""dax"" occurs, nor does it seem to depend on the presence of other words. The output ""green"" is consistent whenever ""dax"" is present. 

Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in an input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red.""

wif -> red. Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output, irrespective of its position or repetition in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns that emerge from the provided input-output pairs:

- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"". Here the word ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and the end of the string and it corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""
- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"". Similar to the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is a repetition of the color associated with ""zup.""
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""blue red green green red blue"". The sequence of colors before ""bluf"" is blue red green, and after ""bluf,"" we have green red blue. Notice that ""green"" is the color associated with ""dax,"" which precedes ""bluf,"" and ""red"" with ""wif"" has been repeated before and after ""bluf"".
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red red"". Here, the color for ""zup"" is repeated twice before all subsequent colors follow.
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" becomes ""red red blue yellow"". Again, the color for ""wif"" is repeated immediately after ""bluf,"" and the rest of the colors follow as usual.

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the color associated with the immediately preceding word being repeated in the output before continuing with the regular sequence of colors associated with the remaining words.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated three times. Examining each instance:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" yields ""yellow red red red blue""; ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""yellow"" was repeated three times after ""walm"".
- ""zup lug walm"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue"", where ""blue"" is tripled after ""walm"".
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue""; ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green"", where ""red"" is repeated trice after ""walm"".

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times. Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" could be interpreted as ""repeat the previous color three times.""

walm -> Repeat the previous color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,63
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue. Rule: Whenever 'lug' is present in the input, it corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output.
dax -> meaning. Meaning: green. Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears the rules for generating outputs involve assigning specific colors to specific words. Let's examine each input and the corresponding output to determine what color ""wif"" represents:

1. Input: dax lug wif lug | Output: green blue red blue
2. Input: wif dax wif | Output: red green red
3. Input: dax lug bluf wif | Output: green blue blue red
4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif | Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
5. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red

In every output, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is consistent across all examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Here are the mappings from the input to the output that lead to this conclusion:

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
(zup -> yellow, wif -> red, dax -> green, walm -> green)

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
(wif -> red, bluf -> red, lug -> blue, zup -> yellow)

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow
(dax -> green, bluf -> green, zup -> yellow)

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
(zup -> yellow, wif -> red, walm -> red)

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
(lug -> blue, dax -> green, zup -> yellow, dax -> green, walm -> green, wif -> red)

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in repeating the color associated with the word just before it. The color associations based on the examples appear to be:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Now, applying this rule to the word ""bluf"":

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Here, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""bluf"" repeats this color: red red.

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue
After ""zup"" which is yellow, ""bluf"" repeats yellow. Next, ""wif"" gives red, ""dax"" gives green, and ""lug"" gives blue.

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red
""lug"" is blue, then ""bluf"" repeats the blue, and ""wif"" is red.

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
Here, ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, again ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" repeats the last color which was red, ""zup"" is yellow, and the last ""wif"" is red.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Again, ""wif"" is red, followed by ""bluf"" which repeats this color: red red.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to affect the color word that comes after it. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the subsequent color word to be repeated three times. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example: ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example: ""wif walm dax zup"" gives ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" causing ""red"" to repeat three times.
- In the third example: ""dax walm wif zup"" yields ""green green green red yellow."" ""Walm"" proceeds ""dax,"" so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example: ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times; note that the second ""wif"" at the end of the sentence is not affected by ""walm"" because it is not immediately following it.
- In the fifth example: ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" so ""red"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color named by the following word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next mentioned color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif bluf
    ",Output: blue green red red,blue green red red,True,64
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is consistently translated to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"". This conclusion is based on the consistent output whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that each non-English word maps to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow
- walm -> red

Now, looking at the examples where the word ""wif"" is used:

- ""lug zup dax wif"" maps to ""blue yellow green red"". Since the first three colors match the first three words and ""red"" is the only color left, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" maps to ""red yellow yellow red green"". Here, ""wif"" is used twice and both times it maps to ""red"".
- ""zup wif"" maps to ""yellow red"". Here ""zup"" is ""yellow"", followed by ""wif"", which must be ""red"".
- ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red red"". Since ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""wif"" is used in the sequence before, ""wif"" must again correspond to ""red"".
- ""zup lug wif"" maps to ""yellow blue red"". Here again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Every instance of ""wif"" in the example sentences maps to the word ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Through the examination of the provided examples, we can infer a rule based on the consistency of 'zup' and associated output colors.

In the first example:
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" twice.
- ""zup"" is between two instances of ""dax,"" and the corresponding color is ""yellow"".

In the second example:
- ""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" which leads to ""blue"" followed by ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color is ""yellow"" before ""green"".

The third example shows:
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"".
- ""zup"" directly follows ""wif"" and translates to ""yellow"".

In the fourth example:
- ""zup"" precedes and follows ""dax,"" with both instances of ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"".

In the fifth example:
- ""zup"" again leads to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" consistently, and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"".

Across all examples, ""zup"" is consistently producing the output of ""yellow"" regardless of the words that precede or follow it. Additionally, the colors for the other words (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif"") are consistent with their outputs across different sequences suggesting that ""zup"" has an independent meaning.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to always translate to the color that preceded it. For each instance where ""bluf"" appears, it takes on the color of the word before it. Here is the rule identified from the examples:

Rule: 'bluf' takes on the color of the preceding word.

This is evidenced by the fact that whenever a color word comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is the same color. For instance, given ""lug dax bluf,"" where ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and its output is ""green."" This pattern holds consistently across all provided examples.

Therefore:

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Given the examples, we can infer that ""walm"" signifies repeating the color that immediately precedes it three more times. We'll go through the examples to show how this works:

1. ""zup wif walm"" becomes ""yellow red red red."" ""wif"" is red, and following ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated twice more, for a total of three times.
2. ""lug dax walm wif"" becomes ""blue green green green red."" Here, ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated twice more before the sequence continues with ""wif,"" which is red.
3. ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""zup"" is yellow, and following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice more.
4. ""zup wif dax walm"" becomes ""yellow red green green green."" Here, ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" twice more.
5. ""zup wif walm"" again becomes ""yellow red red red,"" with ""wif"" as red and ""walm"" repeating ""red"" twice more.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,65
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. dax lug wif -> green blue red
2. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
3. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
4. wif lug -> red blue
5. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red

From the examples, consider the following observations:

- In every instance, ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- No other context is influencing this - ""lug"" stands alone and is not part of a larger pattern that affects its meaning.

Based on these observations, the rule governing the definition of ""lug"" is consistent regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

The rule is:
Lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax.""

In every example where ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position as ""dax"" does in the input. It appears that the meaning of ""dax"" does not depend on its position or the context given by the surrounding words. The input ""dax"" on its own consistently results in the output ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" can be written as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each instance of ""wif"" results in the word ""red"" in the output, even when ""wif"" is repeated or surrounded by other nonce words. The word ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" but this pattern is independent of the meaning of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

wif -> red. The meaning of ""wif"" is the color red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine each input and its corresponding output, looking for patterns:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
2. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   
3. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   
4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   
5. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   
Analyzing the inputs and outputs, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" The rest of the words in the input correspond to other colors in the output, so we can infer that every word maps to a color, but for the purpose of this task, we are only concerned with ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" based on its role in the inputs and corresponding outputs.

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif  
Output: red red yellow yellow red  
Observation: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". ""bluf"" occurs between ""wif"" and ""zup"" and vice versa, each time followed by the other's color.

Input: zup wif bluf  
Output: yellow red red  
Observation: After ""zup wif"" (yellow red), ""bluf"" results in another ""red"". 

Input: zup bluf dax  
Output: yellow yellow green  
Observation: ""zup"" = yellow, ""dax"" = green. ""Bluf"" comes between them, and it gets the color of the word preceding it.

Input: lug wif bluf  
Output: blue red red  
Observation: ""lug"" = blue, ""wif"" = red, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is again ""red"".

Input: dax bluf wif lug  
Output: green green red blue  
Observation: ""dax"" is green, followed by ""bluf"" which is also green, then ""wif"" is red and ""lug"" is blue. ""Bluf"" takes the color green, the same as the preceding word ""dax"". 

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Thus the meaning of ""bluf"" could be stated as:

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to take on the color value of the word immediately preceding it. Here is the breakdown of how ""walm"" functions in each given example:

- Input: zup dax lug walm zup | Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
  ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue, therefore ""walm"" is blue.

- Input: lug zup walm lug | Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to the color yellow, therefore ""walm"" is yellow.

- Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
  ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue, therefore ""walm"" is blue.

- Input: dax walm lug | Output: green green green blue
  ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to the color green, therefore ""walm"" is green.

- Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug | Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
  ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue, therefore ""walm"" is blue.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,66
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can compare the inputs with their respective outputs to deduce the meaning of the word ""lug."" Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. Input: zup lug dax
   Output: yellow blue green
   - We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   - ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" and now we see that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well. The position of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.

3. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   - Again, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Here's what we can gather from the examples:

- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue""
- ""dax"" alone results in ""green"", and when ""dax"" is combined with other words it still produces ""green""
- ""bluf"" has only appeared once, and it corresponded to ""green""
- ""walm"" consistently results in ""green""

Now, let's take a closer look at ""dax"":

1. In the first example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"".

2. In the second example, the sequence ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" includes ""dax"", and its corresponding translation is ""green"" situated between ""red"" and ""green"".

3. In the third example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" includes ""dax"", which again corresponds to ""green"" situated in between ""blue"" and ""red"".

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" on its own translates directly to ""green"".

5. In the fifth example, ""lug zup dax walm"" includes ""dax"", which results in ""green"", and it is situated after ""yellow"" and before ""green"".

From these examples, we can ascertain that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Considering the examples provided and the outputs associated with each:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
2. When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"".
3. When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
4. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".

Based on these examples, ""bluf"" consistently produces a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Analyzing the examples provided, it seems that each word translates to a specific color, and ""walm"" is one of the words that translates to a color. Let's break down each example to see the pattern:

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
- From this, it can be inferred that ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""dax"" is ""green"", as established. The repetition of the colors in the output suggests that ""walm"" is ""blue"" because it repeats thrice, in the same way the word ""lug"" does.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". Again, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" because ""blue"" is directly following ""walm"" in the output.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"". The word ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""dax"", and ""blue"" repeats twice right before ""green"", which suggests once again that ""walm"" is ""blue"".

Based on the above analysis, the consistent rule seems to be that ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all examples.

Rule: walm -> blue

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,67
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
dax -> meaning. The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Here is how the rule applies to each example:

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup  
Output: red blue blue red yellow  
Rule: wif -> red, lug -> blue, bluf -> blue, wif -> red, zup -> yellow

Input: wif lug dax  
Output: red blue green  
Rule: wif -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green

Input: wif bluf dax  
Output: red red green  
Rule: wif -> red, bluf -> red, dax -> green

Input: wif zup  
Output: red yellow  
Rule: wif -> red, zup -> yellow

Input: dax zup wif  
Output: green yellow red  
Rule: dax -> green, zup -> yellow, wif -> red

So, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". Each example correlates the inputs with color outputs, and by comparing them, we can figure out what each word translates to in terms of color.

Let's examine the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
2. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
3. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
4. Input: dax lug zup
   Output: green blue yellow
5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Looking at these mappings, we see that each nonce word consistently corresponds to the same color in the output.

For instance:
- Every time ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- Every time ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
- Every time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".

The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" every time it appears in the input.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:
zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's look at the color outputs associated with its occurrences while taking into account the colors associated with other words that appear in the input.

Considering the first example:
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

We see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", both at the start and at the end. ""Wif"" seems to lead to ""red"", and ""dax"" leads to ""green"". In between the first ""zup"" and ""wif"", there's a ""bluf"", and it leads to another ""yellow"". It could be that ""bluf"" means the same as the word immediately preceding it, which is ""zup"" in this case, hence leading to the color ""yellow"".

In the second and third examples, the input is identical:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and both lead to ""yellow"", which is consistent with the initial observation that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Now considering the fourth example:
Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Here, ""bluf"" follows a ""zup"" and both result in ""yellow"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". This example also supports the hypothesis.

The fifth example also provides insight:
Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and both result in ""blue"". This seems to reinforce the pattern that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

bluf -> meaning: The color of the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".

Rule: ""bluf"" results in the same color output as the word that comes before it in the sequence.
Rule: The term ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. In the given examples, ""lug"" always leads to ""blue blue blue"" when followed by ""walm,"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green green green"" when followed by ""walm."" Therefore, if ""lug"" correlates with the color blue, and ""dax"" correlates with the color green, ""walm"" must indicate that the color should be repeated three times.

walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,68
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, the following rule seems to apply:

dax -> green

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. The other words in the input seem to correspond to their own unique color as well in a consistent manner:

wif -> red
bluf -> red
lug -> blue

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a color in the output. ""Dax"" always translates to ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns between the input and the output. Each input example includes the nonce word ""wif,"" and each output has a sequence of colors. 

Let's look at each example and the position of ""wif"":

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm 
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

3. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green

4. Input: lug dax walm wif 
   Output: blue green green green red

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

Observing the outputs, ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color red. No matter its position in the input sentence, when ""wif"" is present, ""red"" is always in the output sequence.

Additionally, there is no instance in which ""wif"" is associated with a color other than red, indicating that the presence of ""wif"" directly determines the color red in the output.

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" directly corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears. It is used consistently in each example before other nonce words which correspond to different colors.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the previous color mentioned. Each time it is used, the previous color is repeated once.

Here are the observations leading to this conclusion:

1. In the first example, ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" repeats ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green,"" where ""bluf"" repeats ""green.""
3. In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" and here ""bluf"" repeats ""red,"" the color immediately preceding it.
4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" with ""bluf"" duplicating ""red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" is translated into ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" repeats ""blue"" that comes just before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it causes the color word directly preceding it to be repeated once.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the input and corresponding output to find patterns. Let's start by comparing the inputs and outputs with appearances of ""walm.""

1. Input: wif walm zup 
   Output: red red red yellow

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

4. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

By comparing these examples, we notice that ""walm"" always translates to ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input string. Other words preceding and following ""walm"" result in different colors, but ""walm"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> meaning. Rule: walm translates to the color ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow red,True,69
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output, regardless of the other words present or their order.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each instance of the word ""wif"" adds one instance of the word ""red"" to the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce:

1. Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
2. The word following ""zup"" has its own color associated with it (e.g., lug -> blue, dax -> green).

By matching each input with its output, we can infer:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, but this might be a coincidence since ""bluf"" isn't present in any other example.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- ""walm"" seems to be ""green"" in the output, repeating as many times as it appears in sequence.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the commonalities in the input and output pairs:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
4. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
5. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

The word ""bluf"" occurs in all inputs, and in each respective output, the sequence ""red red"" consistently appears. Additionally, every single input word aside from ""bluf"" can be paired with a color in the outputs:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Given that ""bluf"" occurs with ""wif"" just prior to the ""red red"" sequence in every instance where ""wif"" appears, it may seem that ""bluf"" simply repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red."" However, in the fourth input, ""bluf"" stands alone and corresponds to ""yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might take on the color of the word that immediately precedes it, except when it's preceded by ""wif,"" where it then results in a repetition of ""red.""

With the exception of the input pair four where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" we see that ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""red red"" in the output. Thus, we observe the special rule when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" but we cannot confirm a general rule for ""bluf"" when it does not immediately follow ""wif"" as there is only one example that shows ""bluf"" following ""zup"" and resulting in a ""yellow"" in the output.

Considering the evidence provided in the examples, we can assert the following with some degree of certainty:

Rule: When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" However, there isn't sufficient data to fully define ""bluf"" when it does not follow ""wif,"" though it might possibly inherit the color of the preceding word.

bluf -> meaning: When preceded by ""wif,"" bluf means ""red."" When following ""zup,"" bluf means ""yellow."" Further data is needed to define ""bluf"" in other contexts.
Through the provided examples, we can deduce the pattern for what ""walm"" means. Let's break down the examples one by one:

- Input: zup wif lug zup walm
  Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
  Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". Following the pattern, ""walm"" seems to result in repeating the color of the word right before it, which in this case is ""yellow"".

- Input: lug walm zup
  Output: blue blue blue yellow
  ""Lug"" is ""blue"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". ""Walm"" in this instance causes a repetition of ""blue"".

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  With ""walm"" following ""zup"", it seems to repeat ""yellow"" three times.

- Input: zup lug walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue
  ""Zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green blue blue blue
  ""Dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,70
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Regardless of its position or the other words presented with it, 'lug' consistently translates to 'blue'.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word within the input corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow (based on the first input, possibly a repetition or confirmation of ""zup"")
- bluf -> red (based on the last input, possibly an alternative to ""wif"" or an emphasis)

Given this, we can deduce that each occurrence of the word ""dax"" results in the word ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word wif translates to the color red, regardless of the context in which it appears.
zup -> meaning. 

Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" 

Rule: ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the color word before it in the output.

Rule: If a nonce word ""bluf"" follows a color word (lug, wif, dax, or zup corresponding to blue, red, green, or yellow respectively), it causes the color to be repeated in the output. If ""bluf"" is the first word, the absence of a preceding color word might default to ""green,"" which is indicated by its repeated use in the first and second examples. However, there are no provided examples with ""bluf"" as the first word, so the default behavior cannot be confirmed.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word 'walm' dictates the color following it should repeat the color that was just mentioned. Here's the pattern observed:

1. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" After 'walm', the color green (which follows 'dax') is repeated twice before switching to a new color term 'zup'.

2. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" After 'walm', the color yellow (which follows 'zup') is repeated twice, with no additional colors specified.

3. ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" After 'walm', the color blue (which follows 'lug') is repeated twice before switching to a new color term 'wif'.

4. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" After 'walm', the color blue (which follows 'lug') is repeated twice before switching to new color terms.

5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue."" After 'walm', the color green (which follows 'dax') is repeated twice before switching to a new color term 'lug'.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color term mentioned twice.

For example, 'lug walm' would lead to the output 'blue blue blue', where 'lug' stands for blue, and 'walm' causes the preceding color 'blue' to repeat twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,71
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- ""lug"" seems to always correspond to the output ""blue"".
- No other context is given that changes this output meaning when ""lug"" is present.

Given this, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""lug"":

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in every example provided, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the input-output pairings, we can induce the following rules for the word ""wif"" and the other words:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""yellow.""

So, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
By analyzing the position of the nonce word ""zup"" in each input and comparing it to the corresponding color in the output, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind ""zup.""

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
5. lug dax zup dax wif -> blue green yellow green red

- In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"". When ""zup"" precedes or follows ""bluf"", the output for ""zup"" is also ""yellow"".
- In example 2, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and their corresponding colors are ""green"" and ""yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" does not simply take the color of the following word.
- In example 4, ""zup"" occurs after ""dax"" and before ""wif""; the corresponding colors for ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" are ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively.
- In example 5, ""zup"" occurs between ""dax"" and ""dax"", and the corresponding colors for ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" are ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively.

Based on this data, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position relative to other words or the colors they correspond with.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" appears to be correlated with a change in color output from the previous word's output. Here's the assessed pattern:

1. The outputs alternate between two colors until the word ""bluf"" appears, after which the color repeats once before alternating again.
2. ""bluf"" seems to cause the color prior to its occurrence to be repeated once more.

Let's analyze each instance:

- In the first input, the sequence goes red, red, (bluf - which seems to maintain the ""red""), green (due to ""bluf""), green, and then continues alternating with red.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output for ""bluf"" is also green before continuing with the next color.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output for ""bluf"" is another yellow.
- In the fourth input, after the pattern of yellow-green repeats with ""zup"" and ""dax"", ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" (red) and the output is red again.
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and thus the output for ""bluf"" is green as well.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the association between the input and the output for each example. By examining where ""walm"" is in the input and how it impacts the output, we can try to deduce its meaning or the rule it follows:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup,"" yielding two reds and then a yellow after ""zup."" ""Walm"" at the end seems to add a sequence of yellows after ""zup.""

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""Walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and we see a ""blue"" before and after ""zalm."" It also comes before ""zup,"" leading to a yellow.

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""Walm"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""zup,"" resulting in greens and then a yellow for ""zup.""

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""Walm"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""dax,"" leading to two additional blues and then a green.

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" here, resulting in additional reds.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" either repeats the previous color or adds additional instances of the previous color in sequence, except when it comes before ""zup"" or ""dax,"" which then transitions to either yellow or green respectively. The exact transitions of color after ""walm"" can vary, but the pattern of repetition or continuation is clear.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the previous color output before it (causing a sequence of that color), except when followed by ""zup"" (which turns to yellow) or by ""dax"" (which turns to green).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup dax
    ",Output: blue yellow green,blue yellow green,True,72
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance it appears.
Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"". 

Evidence:
- In the first and second examples, ""dax lug"" is consistently translated to ""green blue,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""wif dax bluf"" is translated to ""red green green,"" which further supports that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" since ""bluf"" is repeated as ""green"" and aligns with the first part of the translation, ""red,"" corresponding to ""wif.""
- The fourth example, ""dax wif,"" is translated to ""green red,"" which also supports that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" as seen in the third example.
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green."" If ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" it follows that ""dax"" remains consistent as ""green.""
Based on the given examples, we can find a pattern that correlates each input word with its output color. Let's look at the examples provided:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - A single input word corresponds to a single output color.

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - We see the word 'dax' and associate it with green, 'wif' with red, 'walm' with green repeated twice, and 'zup' with yellow.

3. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   - Here 'wif' is again red, 'bluf' is red, 'dax' is green, and 'lug' is blue.

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - 'zup' is yellow and 'wif' is red.

5. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   - 'wif' is red and 'dax' is green.

From the examples given, it is clear that the nonce word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color 'red' in the output. So the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, each instance of a nonce word (zup, dax, lug, walm) corresponds to a color:

- zup corresponds to yellow
- dax corresponds to green
- lug corresponds to blue
- walm corresponds to blue (based on the second example)

The words appear to keep their assigned colors consistently across the examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond with the output ""yellow"" when it is paired with ""zup"". However, in other contexts, ""bluf"" does not directly translate to ""yellow"". For instance, in the third example ""wif bluf dax"", the word ""bluf"" results in ""red"", which is the same output as the word ""wif"".

Here are the observations from the examples:

1. Input: wif dax zup bluf | Output: red green yellow yellow
2. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
3. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax | Output: green blue yellow red red green
5. Input: wif zup bluf | Output: red yellow yellow

It's clear from examples 1, 2, and 5 that when ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"". This rule does not hold in example 3, indicating that there might be additional rules at play. However, since ""wif"" leads to the output ""red"", and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it also leads to ""red"", we might infer that ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word that precedes it if it's not following ""zup"". Indeed, in example 4, ""bluf"" takes on the output ""red"" when it follows ""wif"".

Consolidating the observations, we can arrive at a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" if it directly follows ""zup"", otherwise it mimics the color output of the word directly preceding it.
Given the example inputs and outputs, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the constant presence of the word ""walm"" in the input and the recurrence of a particular color pattern in the output.

In the input-output pairs, it can be observed that whenever the word ""walm"" is present:

1. In ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by another word (""lug""), and we get ""red red red"" for ""walm.""

2. In ""dax walm wif dax,"" the output is ""green green green red green."" After ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" the presence of ""walm"" is followed by a ""green"" as well, which is part of the repetition of ""green"" three times.

3. In ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" Again, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""

4. In ""dax walm wif,"" the output is ""green green green red."" Similar to the previous examples, ""walm"" correlates with the ""green"" being repeated thrice.

5. In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output is ""green yellow green green green."" When ""walm"" follows two instances of ""dax"" and one ""zup,"" it results in two more instances of ""green.""

Based on these observations, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repeating of the color that precedes it thrice. Therefore, whenever you see ""walm,"" it implies that we should repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. Considering the consistency of this pattern across all the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. The other words — ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" — correspond to their own colors as well, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".
Based on the examples given, the word ""wif"" appears to translate to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds directly to ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples provided and look for patterns:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   
   Before ""zup"" there's a red-yellow-green pattern with the word ""walm"" representing red, ""dax"" representing green, and ""wif"" representing red again. After ""zup,"" the pattern is ""red red yellow.""

2. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   
   ""Zup"" comes first followed by the word ""dax,"" which previously we saw corresponded to green. ""Zup"" in this instance corresponds to yellow.

3. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
   
   Here again, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, which appears just once before ""bluf"". The ""bluf"" seems to start a new pattern of ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red
   
   ""Zup"" translates to yellow, followed by the familiar green for ""dax"" and red for ""wif.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   
   ""Zup"" is followed by ""wif"", contributing to the red color, but ""zup"" stands out with yellow. What follows are ""lug"", associated with the blue color, and ""walm"" with red, but previously we knew ""walm"" as representing red.

Based on the analysis:

- Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned, the next color in the output sequence is always yellow.
- There are color patterns associated with other words, but ""zup"" exclusively correlates to one instance of yellow thereafter.

Rule: Zup -> When occurring in a sequence, ""zup"" causes the next item in the sequence to correspond to the color yellow, and thus can be thought of as a modifier indicating the next color regardless of the preceding colors or patterns.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when following ""zup"" and to ""blue"" when following ""lug"" or ""wif."" There is not enough information to determine the meaning when following ""dax"" or ""walm,"" but since ""bluf"" does not change output when following itself, we can likely rule out that its meaning depends on the preceding word being ""bluf.""

Therefore:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif"", ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"" following ""zup""; ""blue"" following ""lug"" or ""wif"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds with repeating the color associated with the word that comes before it. Here is the rule induction:

- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" – thus ""lug"" must be associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"" – so ""zup"" must be associated with the color yellow, with ""walm"" causing a triple repetition.
- ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red"" – ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" with red, and ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat three times (in this case, red because it is immediately before ""walm"").
- The repetition of ""zup wif walm"" provides the same output, further supporting the rule.
- ""dax walm wif"" produces ""green green green red"" – here ""dax"" must be associated with green, ""walm"" causes green to repeat three times, and ""wif"" is associated with red, appearing once after ""walm"".

The consistent pattern is that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to repeat three times. If there is a word after ""walm"", it has its regular color association without repetition. Thus:

Rule: walm -> causes the color word immediately before it to repeat three times. If another color word follows ""walm"", it is represented once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output always includes the color ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every time ""dax"" appears in an input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Each instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the input-output pairs provided, it appears that each unique word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. The relationship is as follows:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Given that every instance of the word ""bluf"" in the input is consistently translated to ""red"" in the output, we can deduce the meaning associated with ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's look at each input and its corresponding output to identify patterns:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug 
   Output: green green green yellow blue

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

3. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

We're looking for associations between the context around ""walm"" and the colors in the output to establish a rule.

Analyzing these examples, we can observe:

- The first color following ""walm"" in the output repeats the color of the word that precedes it.
- The subsequent colors (after the repeated one) are all red, regardless of the words that follow ""walm.""

The rule appears to be:

- When ""walm"" is presented, the first output color is the same as the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""
- After which, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of red(s).

Now apply this rule to confirm if it holds for each example:

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green"" where green is repeated as the color of ""dax"" (before ""walm""), followed by ""yellow blue"" where ""zup"" equals yellow and ""lug"" equals blue.

2. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue,"" where blue is a repetition of the color of ""lug"" (which precedes the first ""walm""), and the sequence of reds follows for ""wif"" and the second ""walm.""

3. ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again with the repetition of ""yellow"" from ""zup"" (before ""walm""), followed by a red for ""wif"".

4. ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" where blue is the color repeated from ""lug"" (before ""walm""), and it's followed by red for ""wif"".

5. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red,"" with the last ""red red red"" sequence following the pattern where ""walm"" leads to repeated reds after the initial color repetition.

The hypothesized rule seems consistent across the examples.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, output the color corresponding to the preceding word, followed by a series of reds.

Therefore: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word, then continue with red(s).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,75
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"". It does not matter where ""lug"" appears in the sequence; its output is always ""blue"". Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Based on the given examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a particular color. The word 'dax' consistently translates to 'green'. Here is how it breaks down:

- Input: dax wif => Output: green red
- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax => Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- Input: wif lug dax => Output: red blue green
- Input: zup dax lug dax => Output: yellow green blue green
- Input: dax bluf => Output: green green

Considering these examples, we can see that regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input sequence, the output is always 'green'.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must analyze the corresponding outputs in relation to the input containing the word ""bluf.""

From the provided examples:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
4. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
5. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red

In each of these examples, the appearance of ""bluf"" results in a double color in the output, with the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" For example:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""bluf,"" we have ""yellow yellow.""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""bluf,"" we have ""red red.""
3. ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""bluf,"" we have ""red red.""

Given this pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a rule that duplicates the color of the word that comes before it. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the color of the preceding word.

Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""walm"" consistently translates to repeated occurrences of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   The ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and is repeated three times.

2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   Similar to the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the color yellow is repeated three times.

3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with the color red, and so red is repeated three times.

4. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" associated with green, resulting in green being repeated three times before the sequence continues to the color associated with ""wif.""

5. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" translating into three yellows, and the second ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" thus repeating the color red three times.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the immediately preceding word should be repeated three times. 

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm dax
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow green,yellow yellow yellow green,True,76
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", let's analyze the outputs associated with its presence and the contexts where it alters the sequence of colors in the outputs.

1. When looking at examples 1, 4, and 5, one pattern that emerges is that ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"" in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" itself could translate directly to ""green"".
   
2. In example 2, ""dax lug"" outputs ""green blue"", and in example 3, ""dax bluf wif"" outputs ""green green red"". The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". ""Dax"" precedes ""green"" both times, reinforcing the direct translation rule.

3. In example 1, ""dax"" occurs after ""wif walm"" which both translate to ""red red"", and it still results in a ""green"" output. So, ""dax"" does not seem to depend on the words immediately before it to translate to ""green"".

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be independent of context—the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided. 

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the correlation between the inputs containing the word ""wif"" and their respective outputs:

1. ""wif zup"" correlates with ""red yellow.""
   This suggests that ""wif"" may correspond to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

2. ""lug wif walm"" correlates with ""blue red red red.""
   Since ""walm"" appears once in the input but is represented three times in the output (""red red red""), we can infer that ""wif"" likely represents the color ""red"" and is not related to the number of times ""red"" is repeated in the output.

3. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" correlates with ""blue red green green green yellow.""
   Given that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" and ""walm"" to ""green"" (repeated since both are present), and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" it again confirms that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" correlates with ""yellow yellow red green red yellow.""
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" yet again suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. ""zup wif"" correlates with ""yellow red.""
   With ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" the output reinforces that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on the above correlations in every input-output pair, we can induce that:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Let's check this against the examples:

1. Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup wif bluf zup -> Output: yellow red red yellow
   - The first ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to another ""red,"" and the second ""zup"" to the second ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" the first ""zup"" to the first ""yellow,"" ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color (""yellow""), ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the repeating ""walm"" continues to repeat ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   - The first ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to another ""red,"" the second ""zup"" to the second ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
   - ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf,"" similar to the previous examples, again corresponds to ""green.""

The consistent rule in each case is that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" This rule applies regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" mimics the color mentioned immediately before it. Here is the breakdown of the examples:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf mimics ""yellow"" from ""zup"")
2. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red (bluf mimics ""green"" from ""dax"")
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf mimics ""yellow"" from ""zup"", same as the first example)
4. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue (bluf mimics ""blue"" from ""lug"")
5. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red (bluf mimics ""red"" from ""wif"")

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the data provided, it seems like the nonce word ""walm"" takes the color value of the previous word listed within each input sequence. Let's verify this by analyzing each given example:

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red
Here, ""lug"" leads to the color ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" takes the color ""blue"" right after it.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
Following ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in the color ""green,"" which is the same color ""dax"" is mapped to.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and takes its color value, which is ""blue.""

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
Consistent with the previous examples, ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
Following this pattern, ""walm"" takes the color value of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Rule: walm -> assumes the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,77
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each instance it appears in the examples provided.
The given examples provide a consistent pattern which allows the determination of what ""dax"" means in each context. Comparing the inputs with the corresponding outputs:

1. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
2. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. lug dax zup wif -> blue green yellow red
5. dax lug -> green blue

In all instances, the presence of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Therefore:

dax -> meaning. Rule: dax means ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the output contains ""yellow"" at the corresponding position. Additionally, the other words seem to consistently correspond to specific colors as well (e.g., ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, ""bluf"" -> blue).

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can observe that each time the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, it corresponds to a color in the output that matches the color mapped to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Here are the observations:

Example 1: ""zup bluf dax lug"" maps to ""yellow yellow green blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Example 2: ""wif bluf dax"" maps to ""red red green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Example 3: ""lug bluf wif"" maps to ""blue blue red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Example 4: ""lug wif lug bluf"" maps to ""blue red blue blue."" ""Bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue.""

Example 5: ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" maps to ""yellow green green yellow green."" ""Bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which maps to ""green.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before bluf.""

So, the rule for bluf is:

bluf -> meaning: repeat the color of the preceding word.
To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the patterns of input and corresponding output:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""

First, let's note that repetitions of ""walm"" result in repetitions of the last color provided before ""walm"". Here are the observations:

- In example 1, ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue,"" and the presence of ""walm"" right after it results in the repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- In examples 2 and 3, which are identical, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"" three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" thus resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times. ""Wif"" comes after ""walm"" and translates to ""red,"" while ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and appears twice at the beginning, followed by ""bluf dax bluf,"" which translates to ""green green red."" The word ""walm"" comes after another ""wif,"" so it should result in ""red"" being repeated. However, only one ""red"" follows, which is puzzling because we might have expected it to follow the same repeating pattern. But then, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is followed by another ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

The pattern is not clear in Example 5, as ""walm"" should have been followed by a repetition of ""red"" but is not, leading to some inconsistency.

Given the evidence, it seems that ""walm"" might indicate the repetition of the color word appearing immediately before it. The number of times the color is repeated might depend on specific rules not provided in the examples.

However, there is an inconsistency in the provided examples regarding the rule about ""walm,"" especially with example 5, which does not follow the repeating pattern established by the other examples. If we overlook example 5 or assume there may be a misprint, and relying solely on the other examples, the most likely rule is: 

Rule: walm causes the previous color word to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the meaning is:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue' in every example provided.
Reviewing the examples provided, I will analyze each instance where the nonce word ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output color to deduce its meaning or the rule behind it.

Example Analysis:

1. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" here, following a ""bluf"" (""blue"") and preceding another ""bluf"".

2. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" here, following ""walm"" (""blue"").

3. ""dax wif zup dax"" -> ""green red yellow green""
   - ""dax"" first corresponds to ""green"" and then to ""green"" again at the end, here following a ""zup"" (""yellow"").

4. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it is at the start.

5. ""zup lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue yellow red green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end, following a ""wif"" (""red"").

From the analysis, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the words that come before or after it.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a unique color. We can see that the presence of ""wif"" in every input leads to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"". The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" across all examples.
2. ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""walm"" when repeated becomes multiple ""yellow"".
3. ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"". ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"".
4. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeated is ""yellow"".
5. ""lug zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""blue yellow green red yellow"". Again, ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""wif"" is ""red"".

Combining these observations, we find that ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word one more time before proceeding with the next color code if there is one. If ""bluf"" occurs at the end of a sequence, the last color is not repeated.

1. In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and when ""bluf"" is used immediately after, we get an extra ""blue"" before proceeding to ""walm"" which corresponds to red. The next word is ""wif"" which again is red.

2. In the second example, ""lug"" again is blue followed by ""bluf"" which adds an extra ""blue."" The sequence ends with ""wif"" which is red, and it's repeated because of ""bluf.""

3. In the third example, ""lug"" is blue and is followed by ""bluf,"" which repeats the blue again. There are no more color words after ""bluf,"" so it ends there.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green and is followed by ""bluf,"" which adds an extra ""green."" Then ""wif"" gives us a red followed by ""zup"" which is yellow, and the last ""wif"" again is red.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" duplicates the yellow, ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, followed by another ""wif"" which is red and ending with ""zup"" as yellow.

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the prior mentioned color word one additional time.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and try to correlate occurrences of ""walm"" with the patterns in the output.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

In both of these examples, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of ""red,"" but the number of reds that follow ""walm"" does not change when we add or remove other words.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Here, adding ""dax"" to the sequence introduces ""green,"" which comes after the sequence of reds. Notably, ""walm"" still corresponds to three reds.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

This example is particularly revealing. ""Dax"" is leading to ""green,"" and ""walm"" also results in green. It appears that ""walm"" may be taking on the color value of the word preceding it.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which has the output color ""blue."" The output for ""walm"" in this instance is three ""blue.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" results in a repetition of three of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. 

Rule: walm -> meaning: ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of the color that represents the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,79
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue
- walm -> blue (since ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"" and ""wif"" is known to be red, thus ""walm"" would be blue to make the repetition)

Each example string is turned into a series of colors by replacing these words with their corresponding color. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in each example.

Thus, we can conclude:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of 'dax', let's look for patterns connected with its presence in the examples provided and the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   It looks like 'dax' is followed by 'green' and 'walm' is also followed by 'green'. 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Again, 'dax' and 'walm' correspond to 'green'. 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'lug' to 'blue', before 'dax' starts another sequence of 'green'.

3. Input: zup bluf dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow green blue
   'dax' is followed by 'green' and 'lug' by 'blue'; other words 'zup' and 'bluf' both correspond to 'yellow'.

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   'lug' is followed by 'blue', 'zup' by 'yellow', and 'dax' followed by 'walm' both by 'green'.

5. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   'dax' correlates with 'green', 'lug' with 'blue', and 'wif' with 'red'.

Looking at the patterns, 'dax' corresponds to 'green' consistently in all examples, regardless of what comes after it. Therefore, we can deduce the rule that 'dax' is an indicator for the color 'green' in these examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Reviewing the examples provided, we can analyze the patterns to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif.""

Input: zup dax wif zup
Output: yellow green red yellow
Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" and we see ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: zup wif lug wif
Output: yellow red blue red
In this instance, ""wif"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" giving us ""red"" after ""yellow"" and before ""blue."" Also, ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red.""

Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue
Here, ""wif"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""lug,"" with ""red"" positioned similarly in the output.

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
""Wif"" precedes ""dax,"" which corresponds with ""red"" preceding ""green.""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
""Wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" matching the pattern where ""red"" is followed by ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" every time it appears. It does not appear to change meaning based on surrounding words or context.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" I will analyze the pattern of outputs relative to the position of ""zup"" and the surrounding words.

1. ""dax bluf zup"" -> green green yellow
2. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> green red yellow yellow red red red
3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> red red blue yellow
4. ""dax zup dax zup"" -> green yellow green yellow
5. ""lug zup wif"" -> blue yellow red

From these examples, we can observe:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" in the first example, but corresponds to ""red"" when not followed by ""zup.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when not preceded by ""zup.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when not followed by ""zup.""

Every time ""zup"" occurs, the word that directly follows gives us the output ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is at the end of the sequence, it is still followed by ""yellow.""

Hence, it seems that ""zup"" causes the next word (or its equivalent output) to be translated as ""yellow,"" regardless of what that next word is. If there is no word following ""zup,"" or it is the last in the sequence, its corresponding output remains ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> the following word's corresponding output is yellow, or if at the end, it outputs yellow itself.
The rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems dependent on the preceding word. Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word preceding it. Let's verify this with the examples given:

1. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red
4. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green
5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output: red red yellow red blue green

In examples 2, 3, and 5, we notice that the word directly before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. In example 4, ""bluf"" takes on the color ""green,"" which is the color associated with the preceding word ""dax."" Example 1 also supports this rule as ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and both output as ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule derived from the given examples is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the preceding word in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in each example.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""blue.""

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and as before, ""dax"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively. After ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with the word right before ""walm.""

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Again, ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively. Here, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and results in the color ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

With ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" directly corresponding to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in the color ""green"" being repeated twice.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

The pattern holds with ""zup"" relating to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and once again, ""green"" is repeated twice, which is the color associated with the word right before ""walm.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated three more times if ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or twice if there are additional words following ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated additional times, three if ""walm"" is the last word, and otherwise two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- Other words like ""dax"", ""wif"", ""walm"", and ""bluf"" are each associated with a unique color—green, red, and blue, respectively.
- The presence of ""lug"" in a sequence does not affect the color associated with other words, as seen in the example ""lug walm wif lug"".

Given this, we can determine the rule for ""lug"":

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"". Additional words after ""dax"" determine the repetition of additional colors. For example, ""lug walm"" after ""dax"" produces a repetition of ""blue"" three times. The specific meaning of ""zup"" and ""lug walm"" in terms of color is not defined within the provided examples beyond their association with yellow and blue, respectively.
Based on the provided examples, each input word seems to correspond to a color in the output. Given that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or surrounding words, we can deduce that ""wif"" means red.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be determined as follows:

zup lug -> yellow blue
zup bluf -> yellow yellow
zup -> yellow
lug zup -> blue yellow

From the first three examples, when ""zup"" is followed by another word, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word following ""zup"" dictates the second color: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" In the instance where ""zup"" stands alone, it still corresponds to ""yellow."" When ""zup"" follows another word, as in the fifth example, it again translates to ""yellow,"" and the preceding word dictates the first color, with ""lug"" being ""blue"" in this case.

Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" results in a repeated color from the preceding word. Each time ""bluf"" appears, the output is the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence:

- In the first example: ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- In the third example: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- In the fourth example: ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
- In the fifth example: ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""

This pattern holds consistently across all examples given. Therefore, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' represents a repetition of the color that is mentioned just before 'bluf'.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before bluf.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns for each word:

- lug seems to correspond to blue.
- wif seems to correspond to red.
- zup seems to correspond to yellow.
- dax seems to correspond to green.

The word walm appears to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it. For example:
- In ""lug walm"", lug corresponds to blue, and then walm also corresponds to blue.
- In ""zup walm"", zup corresponds to yellow, and then walm also corresponds to yellow.

The rule is consistent across all examples. Therefore, we can conclude that:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,81
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the following patterns can be observed for the nonce word ""lug"":

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is always ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input.
- Changing other words in the input (like ""dax"" to ""walm"" or ""zup"" to ""bluf"") changes their respective output colors, but ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""

Therefore, it can be deduced that ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"" irrespective of the context in which it is used.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the sample inputs and their corresponding outputs, it appears that each nonce word has an associated color. Here's the relationship I've inferred:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Every occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the corresponding output position. The colors corresponding to other nonce words are also consistent across the examples.

So the rule can be stated as: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". This is consistent across all examples provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the patterns of input and output, using the provided examples. 

- The first example shows that ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red,"" so it seems that ""zup"" may correlate with the color ""yellow."" 

- The second example ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" might not change the color ""yellow"" that ""zup"" represents.

- In the third example, we see ""lug zup dax zup"" become ""blue yellow green yellow."" Here ""lug"" seems to convert to ""blue,"" ""zup"" remains ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

- The fourth example is a little more complex: ""lug wif dax walm zup"" turns into ""blue red green green green yellow."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to extend the ""green"" before ""zup"" finally appears as ""yellow.""

- The final example maintains the correlation seen so far with ""wif dax zup wif"" becoming ""red green yellow red.""

Considering all examples, the consistent element is that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> meaning. 

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. When ""bluf"" is not preceded by another color word, it defaults to the color blue. 

Rule: 
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is green.
- If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is blue.
- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is yellow.
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is red.
- If ""bluf"" is not preceded by a color word or is the first in the sequence, it defaults to blue.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be a duplicator of sorts for the color word that directly precedes it. Here's the rule induction based on each input and output:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" signifies ""green"" and ""walm"" duplicates it twice to follow, resulting in three greens.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" signifies ""blue"" and ""walm"" duplicates it twice after the original color, leading to three blues.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" so ""wif"" must mean ""red,"" ""bluf"" has no apparent effect, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" duplicates ""green"" twice. 
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug wif walm"" produces ""green blue red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif walm"" duplicates ""red"" twice after the initial red, ""lug"" once again means ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- In the final example, ""lug zup dax walm"" becomes ""blue yellow green green green,"" indicating that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" duplicates ""green"" twice following the original occurrence.

From these analyses, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word that comes immediately before it to be output three times in total.

Rule: walm -> triples the preceding color word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,82
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be the color ""blue."" 

Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here's the breakdown that supports this rule:

- ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" which is the reversed order from above, again showing that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow,"" where ""dax"" is the first word and translates to ""green.""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue,"" where ""dax"" is the second word and translates to ""green"" in the middle of other colors.
- ""dax"" standing alone translates directly to ""green.""

Given these consistent mappings, it is appropriate to conclude the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at each example and observe the patterns:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" in the third position changes the next ""lug"" from blue to red.

2. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - Each occurrence of ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""

3. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - When ""wif"" is alone, it results in ""red.""

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - After ""wif,"" the next word output is repeated and ""walm"" is changed from green to red.

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - The ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""pink."" (This use of ""pink"" could be a typographical error or limitation in the current example set, as the first example indicates ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Adjusting to ""blue"" for consistency.)
   - ""walm"" remains ""blue.""

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" has the rule of changing the following word's color to red, and if ""wif"" stands alone, it results in red. Additionally, when ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" not only the immediate next word but subsequent ""walm"" occurrences also turn red until a different non-""walm"" word appears.

Rule: wif -> Changes the color of the following word to red, regardless of its original color. If ""wif"" stands alone, it is red. When followed by ""walm"", ""wif"" causes all subsequent ""walm"" words to become red until a different word breaks the sequence.
Based on the examples provided and the consistent translation of each instance of ""zup,"" it appears that the word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow every time it is used, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that follow or precede it.

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

This is supported by all given examples, as each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" dictates the repetition of the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it. 

Here is a breakdown of each example:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" therefore ""bluf"" results in repeating the color ""red.""

2. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" results in repeating the color ""green.""

3. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" meaning ""bluf"" results in an additional ""green.""

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" replicates the color ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" resulting in another ""green.""

Rule: 
bluf -> The output is the color corresponding to the word preceding bluf, effectively repeating that color.
Based on the examples provided, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at its corresponding outputs. Here's what we can deduce from the given data:

1. After ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""yellow.""
2. After ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""red.""
3. After ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" the output is ""yellow green green green blue red."" In this case, ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""green.""
4. After ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red."" ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""green.""
5. After ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue green."" Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of a color three times. The color that is repeated correlates to the last color word mentioned before ""walm.""

Here are the specific rules identified:
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

Given this pattern, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" causes the next color word to be outputted three times in a row based on the last color word provided before ""walm.""

So the overall rule for ""walm"" would be: walm -> It replicates the immediately preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,83
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> ""blue""

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green'. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, 'dax' is always associated with the output 'green'. The other words do not seem to affect the output related to 'dax'.

Rule: dax -> green. The word 'dax' means the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, there are other words that seem to determine the number of times ""yellow"" is outputted in relation to other colours (""dax"" for green and ""wif"" for red) and potentially their ordering. Here's how it appears to work:

- ""zup"" on its own results in a single ""yellow"".
- When preceded by ""walm"", the word ""zup"" is outputted in triplicate, as indicated by ""walm zup walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"". 
- The number of occurrences of the preceding color word (e.g., ""dax"" for green or ""wif"" for red), determines the number of times that color word is outputted in triplicate before ""zup"" output starts.

So the general rule we can derive based on these observations is:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". When flanked by ""walm"", output ""yellow"" three times. Other colors represented by words such as ""dax"" (green) or ""wif"" (red) that precede ""zup"" are also outputted as triplets before the yellow sequence. If ""walm"" follows these color words, the triplet pattern is sustained; otherwise, a single occurrence of the color word is produced.

Thus, zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be the following: 

When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is two instances of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Therefore, in the context of this problem:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

So, if ""bluf"" follows these words, the output is the color corresponding to the preceding word, repeated twice.

Hence, the rule is:

bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" twice in the output.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present in the input, output the color associated with the word before ""bluf"" and repeat it once. 
For example:

If the input is ""word1 bluf"", and ""word1"" corresponds to ""Color1"", the output would be ""Color1 Color1"".
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color that follows its mention in the sequence multiple times. To support this deduction, let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup wif walm Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, after ""walm"" red is repeated three times.

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- After ""walm"" the color yellow is repeated three times.

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup Output: blue red green green green yellow
- After ""walm"" the color green is repeated three times.

4. Input: lug zup walm lug Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- After ""walm"" the color yellow is repeated three times.

5. Input: dax lug walm Output: green blue blue blue
- After ""walm"" the color blue is repeated three times.

Walm seems to influence the output such that the color corresponding to the word immediately following ""walm"" is repeated exactly three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,84
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" represents the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

This implies ""dax"" means ""green.""
To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the input and output of each example:

1. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - ""wif"" correlates with the word ""red,"" but there's no context from other words.

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - Here, ""wif"" is sandwiched between ""lug walm"" and ""lug bluf,"" with the corresponding output being ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Considering ""lug"" appears with both ""walm"" and ""bluf"" on either side of ""wif,"" it might suggest that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" still results in ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" which suggests that ""wif"" leads to a sequence of ""red"" colors. If ""walm"" correlates to multiple occurrences of red, ""wif"" alone might simply prompt a red response.

4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   - Like the first case, ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red."" ""dax"" seems to be unrelated to ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - ""wif"" on its own leads to ""red,"" confirming the association of ""wif"" with the color red.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" When ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is always present in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs. Specifically, we should consider the position and repetition of ""zup"" and analyze how it affects the sequence of colors in the output.

Looking at the first example:
Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Considering ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" we can deduce:
- ""zup"" at the start of the sequence translates to ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" following ""lug"" (blue) translates again to ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

In the second example:
Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

Given that ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow"" respectively, we see that:
- ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow"" at the start and after ""lug.""

In the third example:
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Here, ""zup"" comes before ""wif"" (red) and translates to ""yellow.""

In the fourth example:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Here, ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and is followed by another ""yellow.""

Finally, in the fifth example:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

We have ""wif"" (red) followed by ""walm,"" which seems to repeat the preceding color (""red""). After that, we see ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow,"" whether it comes before ""lug"" (blue) or ""walm.""

From these examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" despite the context or other words around it. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the examples provided, each 'Input' and corresponding 'Output' seems to represent a pattern where each nonce word maps to a certain color.

Let's analyze each input and its output sequentially to deduce the rule:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   Here bluf is associated with red.

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Here again, the position where 'bluf' appears corresponds to red.

3. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   Once more, bluf corresponds to red.

4. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   In this case, bluf translates to green which seems inconsistent with previous examples unless wif has an influence on the meaning of the following word.

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   In this case, directly following 'dax', 'bluf' translates to green, which is consistent with the example 4 but not with the examples 1-3.

Let's hypothesize that 'bluf' means red unless it directly follows 'dax', in which case it means green. Now we'll revisit each example to see if this hypothesis holds:

1. In ""wif bluf dax"" bluf is not directly following dax, so it translates to red.
2. In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", bluf does not follow dax, so it translates to red.
3. In ""dax lug wif bluf"", even though dax appears before bluf, they are not consecutive, so bluf still translates to red.
4. In ""wif dax bluf"", bluf directly follows dax, so it translates to green.
5. In ""dax bluf"", bluf directly follows dax, so it translates to green.

Thus, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: Bluf translates to red unless it is directly preceded by the word ""dax"", in which case it translates to green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs to find a pattern.

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Now, let's break down what we can observe:

1. When ""wif"" leads, the output starts with ""red red red"".
2. When ""zup"" leads, the output starts with ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. When ""dax"" leads, the output starts with ""green green green"".
4. After the leading triples, the pattern seems to change, depending on what follows.

With these points in mind, let’s focus on the usage of ""walm"" in the inputs and its corresponding outputs:

- ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in a repetition of ""red"". Hence, it seems like ""walm"" could mean ""repeat"".
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" also results in yellow being repeated.
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" also results in green being repeated.
- ""walm"" when followed by ""lug"" has a consistent presence of ""blue"" in the output.

Given these points, it looks like ""walm"" might be a command for repetition - it causes the color corresponding to the prior word to be repeated multiple times in the output.

So ""walm"" after ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax"" causes the color red, yellow, or green, respectively, to be repeated. In cases where ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" there seems to be an occurrence of ""blue"" that is consistently present whether ""walm"" is preceded by any of the other words.

Based on these findings, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word. If followed by ""lug,"" introduce ""blue"" after the repetition.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word 'wif' corresponds directly to the color 'red'. The translations from the input to output consistently replace 'wif' with 'red'. Other words such as 'bluf', 'lug', 'zup', and 'walm' correspond to 'blue', 'blue', 'yellow', and 'yellow', respectively, but the specific meaning of 'dax' is not illustrated with just one occurrence.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's examine the consistencies in the examples.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- 'zup' and 'bluf' both translate to 'yellow'.

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red
- 'zup' is the second word and translates to 'yellow' again.
- This indicates 'dax' is 'green' and 'wif' is 'red'.

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- Consistent with previous examples, 'zup' is 'yellow', and 'bluf' is 'yellow'. 'dax' is 'green'.

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
- The word 'lug' translates to 'blue', as it is one-for-one with the output.
- 'walm' is followed by doubled output, indicating that 'walm' also translates to 'blue' but results in a doubled output of 'blue yellow'.
- When 'zup' follows 'walm', it results in 'yellow'.

Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
- Again, 'zup' and 'bluf' translate to 'yellow'. 'lug' translates to 'blue'.
- Since 'zup' is at the end and still translates to a single 'yellow', it suggests that 'zup' translates to 'yellow' without influence by position.

Observing these consistent translations, the rule for 'zup' can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

'zup' consistently means 'yellow' irrespective of its position in the input.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" directly translates to ""yellow"" when it is preceded by ""zup,"" to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax,"" and to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug."" When ""bluf"" stands alone, it maintains the color translation corresponding to the word that directly precedes it in prior usage, or possibly the word that most commonly precedes it.

Here are the examples with the corresponding color translations:

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green"". ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and therefore is ""yellow"".

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows it, so ""bluf"" is also ""yellow"".

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" so it is ""yellow"".

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""wif"" is a new word and correlates with ""red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and therefore is ""blue"".

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows it, thus ""bluf"" is ""green"".

Rule: Bluf -> takes on the color of the word that precedes it (yellow when following ""zup,"" blue when following ""lug,"" and green when following ""dax""). If ""bluf"" is standalone, it retains the color associated with its most recent or most common preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples.

- In the first example, the output is ""green blue blue blue"" for an input that includes ""dax lug walm."" We can't directly deduce the meaning of ""walm"" yet, as it is the first example, but we can keep this in mind for comparison with further examples.

- The second input is ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" and the output is ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" There is one occurrence of ""lug"" and ""dax"" before ""walm"" and several of ""zup."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" but since it doesn't appear in other examples, it's hard to deduce a pattern for ""walm"" from this alone.

- In the third example, we have ""zup walm lug,"" which leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" we can deduce that ""walm"" is likely to be responsible for some of the ""yellow"" outcomes. This implies that ""walm"" might have to do with repeating the color associated with the word that appears directly before it.

- The fourth example says ""wif lug dax walm,"" with an output of ""red blue green green green."" We know that ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Following the previous assumption that ""walm"" implies repetition, we see that ""green"" is repeated after ""dax,"" which is consistent with the idea that ""walm"" repeats the previous color.

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" Only ""lug"" and ""walm"" are in the input, and since we know ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" this strengthens the idea that ""walm"" implies repetition since ""blue"" is the color outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word directly before ""walm"" as many times as necessary to reach a total of four colors in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,86
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the repetitive patterns where ""lug"" appears and the corresponding outputs it produces.

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

- Here, the word that precedes ""lug"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

- In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

- ""lug"" follows two different words here: ""zup"" and ""wif"", which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red,"" respectively, yet after both instances of ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

- This example is repeated and continues to show that ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

- In this example, ""lug"" is both the first word and follows ""wif."" The outputs are ""blue blue"" at the start, suggesting that ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue."" ""walm"" and ""wif"" follow the first ""lug"" and correspond to ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively. A second ""lug"" after ""wif"" gives ""blue"" again. ""Bluf"" also results in ""blue.""

From these examples, the common factor for every instance of the word ""lug"" is that the output is always ""blue,"" regardless of its position or the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that specific words are consistently translated to specific colors:

- ""dax"" always translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" always translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" either translates to ""red"" or affects the color of the following word, but there's not enough data to define its rule.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""

However, we do have a consistent rule for the word ""dax"" as it always results in the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule:
dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should examine how it is used in relation to other words in the examples provided and their corresponding outputs.

Let's analyze:

1. ""dax wif lug"" translates to ""green red blue.""
2. ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue.""
3. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green.""
5. ""wif zup lug"" translates to ""red yellow blue.""

Looking at these examples, we can try to identify what each word translates to based on repetition and placement:

- ""dax"" appears in the first, second, third, and fourth examples, and it always translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" appears in the first, second, and third examples, and it always translates to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" appears in the third and fourth examples, and it translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" appears in the third and fourth examples, and when it follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" appears in the fifth example, and it translates to ""yellow.""

Now let's focus on ""wif."" Looking at the placement of ""wif"" and its corresponding output ""red,"" we can see that every time ""wif"" is used, it translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position with respect to the other words.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that irrespective of its context or position in the input, ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
To induce the rule for ""zup,"" we need to analyze the correlation between the input and output in each example. Let's examine each one:

1. Input: ""zup dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow green green green""
   
   Without more context, it is not obvious what each word stands for, but we can say with some certainty that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as it is the only word that appears once in both input and output.

2. Input: ""zup wif lug zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   
   Again, ""zup"" at the beginning of the sequence corresponds to ""yellow"" at the beginning of the output. The second occurrence of ""zup"" is followed by two ""yellow,"" which may suggest that ""zup"" not only corresponds to ""yellow"" but might also repeat the color one additional time in the output or could be affected by the following word ""walm."" 

3. Input: ""lug zup""
   Output: ""blue yellow""
   
   With ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" the one-to-one correspondence remains consistent.

4. Input: ""wif zup bluf""
   Output: ""red yellow yellow""
   
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to the first ""yellow,"" and it seems that ""bluf"" may repeat the previous color (in this case, ""yellow"").

5. Input: ""wif dax zup dax""
   Output: ""red green yellow green""
   
   ""zup"" is between two ""dax"" and corresponds to ""yellow."" It is not repeating a color before or after it, which suggests that the double ""yellow"" in previous examples might be influenced by a specific word, such as ""bluf"" or ""walm.""

From these patterns, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds with ""yellow,"" both when it appears alone and when surrounded by other words. The repetition of colors in the outputs seems to be influenced by other words, rather than ""zup"" itself.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" it's necessary to identify patterns in each input that correlates with the appearance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output. In each case, ""bluf"" is included in the input, while ""red red"" is consistently part of the output. Here are the correlations for each input and output:

- Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
- Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
- Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
- Input: dax bluf wif lug zup -> Output: green green red blue yellow
- Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red

In the third input, ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green,"" and in the fourth, ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" it is ""green green red blue yellow."" The presence of ""wif"" and ""dax"" in these inputs impacts the output colors, particularly the position of ""green."" Despite the different sequences in the inputs, ""bluf"" consistently maps to the double ""red"" in the output.

There is a clear pattern for ""bluf,"" and we can see that other words in the inputs correspond to specific output colors. For example:
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

Therefore, ""wif"" does not seem to induce any color by itself, but it appears directly before ""bluf"" in each input.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> red red

This rule indicates that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red red"" will be part of the corresponding output.
Based on the provided examples, we can notice that the output associated with ""walm"" seems to vary depending on other words present in the input. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

To determine the rule for ""walm,"" let's look for patterns before and after ""walm"" appears:

- In the first input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output after ""lug"" is ""blue,"" which is the same color as before ""walm."" Then ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" and the color changes to ""green."" This is the same pattern for colors both before and after ""dax"" without ""walm.""
- In the second input, the pattern is similar to the first, where ""lug"" precedes and follows ""walm,"" with ""blue"" color outputs. The word ""wif"" causes the output to change to ""red"" after ""walm.""
- In the third input, ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red,"" and after ""dax"" and ""zup,"" the colors are ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The ""walm"" occurs after ""zup,"" and the color stays ""yellow.""
- The fourth input is simply ""zup walm,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that the presence of ""zup"" continues as ""yellow"" after ""walm.""
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" before ""walm"" changes the color to ""red"" and this color persists after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" does not change the color itself. Rather, it causes the repetition or continuation of the color determined by the word that immediately precedes it. If no word precedes it, as in input 4, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting a default color state of ""yellow"" in the absence of a preceding word that would determine color.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately before it; if there is no preceding word, the default output color is yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,87
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color as follows:

dax -> green
lug -> blue
wif -> red
bluf -> green (note that ""bluf"" appears to directly map to ""green"" as well, which could imply a one-to-many mapping where multiple nonce words can represent the same color, or it might be a context-dependent anomaly.)

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific color.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. When ""wif"" is present on its own as an input, the output is ""red."" Additionally, in the presence of another word, the output includes an additional color corresponding to the second word, as seen in the example ""wif lug"" where the output is ""red blue."" However, based only on the supplied examples, the rule for additional words such as ""lug"" cannot be definitively determined, as there is only one instance provided.
zup -> meaning. Based on the examples given, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". 

Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" I'll look for patterns in the examples given where the word ""bluf"" appears and consider the corresponding outputs.

In each output, whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" is part of the output immediately after the previous color is repeated. The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the preceding color to repeat before it adds ""green."" Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - After ""dax,"" we have ""green,"" and then ""bluf"" triggers another ""green.""

2. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
   - After ""lug,"" we have ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which triggers another ""blue."" 

3. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - After ""zup,"" we have ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which triggers another ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - After ""zup,"" we have ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which triggers another ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   - After ""dax,"" we have ""green,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which triggers another ""green.""

Based on the above, the rule is:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by a word, it outputs the color associated with that word again before producing ""green.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be to duplicate the previously mentioned color followed by ""green.""

bluf -> meaning: Duplicate the previous color and then output ""green"".
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the association between the inputs and outputs in different cases.

In every example, the word ""walm"" appears to cause the word that comes right before it to be repeated in the output. Let's look at the examples to see if this pattern holds true:

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Here, ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" repeating ""blue"" an extra time.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Again, ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" and we see ""blue"" repeated an extra time (blue blue blue) in the output.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Once more, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated an extra time.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

The same pattern: ""lug"" before ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

In this case, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""red"" is repeated an extra time.

Based on these examples, we can define a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated once more in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow green,yellow yellow,False,88
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in English. Every time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, ""blue"" appears in the exact same position in the output. The presence and position of ""lug"" are consistent with the presence and position of ""blue"" and independent of the context created by other words around it.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following relationships:

- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue""
- ""walm"" when used alone or as the last word in the sequence, consists of repeated ""blue"" for as many times as it appears. For example, ""walm"" by itself translates to ""blue blue"" and ""dax walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"".
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red""

When looking at ""dax"":

- ""zup lug dax"" becomes ""yellow blue green""
- ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue""
- ""dax lug"" becomes ""green blue""
- ""wif zup dax bluf"" includes an unknown word ""bluf"" at the end. Since the sequence translates to ""red yellow green green"", and we know the meanings of ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""dax"", we may assume ""bluf"" translates to another ""green"". However, we can ignore ""bluf"" for the purpose of deducing the meaning of ""dax"".
- ""zup wif dax walm"" becomes ""yellow red green green green"", confirming that ""walm"" corresponds to multiple ""blue"" and that ""dax"" equates to a single ""green"".

From these examples, we see that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Reviewing the given examples and their respective outputs, we make the following observations:

1. Input ""dax lug bluf wif"" produces the output ""green blue blue red"". The word ""wif"" appears last and corresponds to the output ""red"".
   
2. Input ""dax walm wif dax"" produces the output ""green green green red green"". Here, ""wif"" appears third in sequence and is followed by another instance of ""dax"", with ""red"" again mapping to ""wif"".

3. Input ""zup wif zup"" produces the output ""yellow red yellow"". The word ""wif"" is in the middle and corresponds to ""red"". 

4. Input ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" produces the output ""green green green red blue green green green"". Here ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"", placed between instances of ""green"".

5. Input ""wif zup dax"" produces the output ""red yellow green"". ""wif"" comes first here and maps to ""red"".

In all examples, irrespective of its position, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". Therefore, it is logical to deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: In the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repeating color pattern that is determined by the word that comes immediately before it. Let's examine each example to understand the pattern:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is two yellows.
   
2. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is two reds.

3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is two yellows.
   
4. wif bluf -> red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is two reds.
   
5. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
   ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is two greens.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the meaning of ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word that precedes it, repeated twice.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each instance where it occurs and the corresponding output:

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

- ""zup"" corresponds to a single yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" seems to correspond to an additional red. ""walm"" in this context is paired with three yellows.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

- ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" follows with three reds.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" is directly followed by two reds.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

- This is a repeated input/output confirming the consistency of ""wif"" with red and ""walm"" followed by two reds.

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" is paired with two blues here.

From the examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word it follows before the next color word. For every input of ""walm,"" there is a repetition of the preceding color before moving on to the next color word. However, since we don't have examples of ""walm"" with a different preceding word, we cannot confirm if ""walm"" always triples the previous color, or it just adds two more occurrences. To be conservative, based on the given examples, we can say that:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats the color of that word two additional times before moving to the next color.

Rule: If ""walm"" is preceded by a word that corresponds to a color, output that color twice more before processing the next word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,89
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""lug"":

Input: wif lug wif
Output: red blue red
- Here, the word 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'lug' is followed by 'blue'.

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- In this sequence, the word 'dax' corresponds to 'green’, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue'. Whenever 'lug' appears, 'blue' follows.

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and after 'lug', 'blue' is next, followed by 'bluf' which also corresponds to 'blue' and 'wif' which corresponds to 'red'.

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue'. 'Lug' precedes 'blue' here, which follows the pattern.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and 'bluf' to 'blue'. Before 'bluf', 'lug' appears which is followed by 'blue'.

From the patterns, it is clear that the word ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input. Therefore, it appears that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

Rule:
lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- When ""wif"" is the only word in the input, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""dax,"" the outputs are ""red green.""
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""lug,"" the outputs are ""red blue.""
- The outputs do not seem to depend on the position of ""wif"" within the sequence since ""wif"" always translates to ""red"" whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sequence.

With the given information, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that in every instance in the inputs, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input phrase.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color that comes before it. When ""bluf"" appears after a color word, the output is the color of that word twice. Here's the breakdown:

1. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow (from ""bluf,"" following ""zup"" which means yellow) green (from ""dax"") blue (from ""lug"")
2. dax zup bluf -> green (from ""dax"") yellow (from ""zup"") yellow (from ""bluf,"" following ""zup"" which means yellow)
3. wif lug bluf -> red (from ""wif"") blue (from ""lug"") blue (from ""bluf,"" following ""lug"" which means blue)
4. lug wif bluf -> blue (from ""lug"") red (from ""wif"") red (from ""bluf,"" following ""wif"" which means red)
5. wif bluf -> red (from ""wif"") red (from ""bluf,"" following ""wif"" which means red)

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> the output color is the same as the color word that comes directly before ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" follows the color word representing red, the output is red red; if it follows the color word for blue, the output is blue blue; and so forth.
Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of the color that precedes it. More specifically, ""walm"" causes the next sequence of output colors to be repeated versions of the color directly prior to ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" which means ""walm"" caused ""red"" to be said three times.
- In the second and third examples, ""zup walm"" consistently results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" caused ""yellow"" to be said three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" turns into ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeated the ""blue"" output three times.
- In the fifth example, the pattern changes slightly in that there are two instances of ""walm."" For ""dax walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times. For ""zup walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times. 

The rule we can deduce is that ""walm"" causes the color word that comes directly before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color name three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,90
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" as it consistently maps to a specific output across all examples. To determine the meaning, we can examine each instance where ""lug"" is used and see what output it correlates to.

- In ""zup lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""dax lug wif walm,"" ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue.""
- In ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""lug"" is the first word and the first output color is ""blue.""
- In ""wif dax lug dax,"" ""lug"" is sandwiched between words that lead to other output colors, but the output directly after ""lug"" is ""blue.""

In all cases, ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue,"" regardless of position or surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the provided examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the correspondence between the inputs and outputs for each example given.

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - Here, ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""red blue.""

2. Input: zup lug wif dax lug
   Output: yellow blue red green blue
   - In this example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""red green."" Previously, ""lug"" corresponded to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - ""wif"" appears multiple times here. ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green"" (as seen in the second example). ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" and ""zup wif"" to ""yellow red.""

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif walm"" to ""red red red.""

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   - ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue,"" and ""bluf zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow.""

Although the precise meaning of ""wif"" is not immediately clear from these examples alone, it appears that ""wif"" could operate as a modifier that adds ""red"" to the sequence of colors outputted. More specifically, ""wif"" seems to be followed by one or more ""red,"" and then the color corresponding to the next word.

Considering this pattern, we formulate the following rule:

Rule: wif -> The word ""wif"" modifies the sequence by adding a ""red"" to the output before the color corresponding to the next word in the input sequence.

This rule is consistent with all the given examples.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. When ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the output is ""yellow"", either alone or in sequence with another color associated with a different nonce word.
Observing the patterns in the given input-output pairs, we can infer that ""bluf"" in each example results in the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here's a breakdown:

1. ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red."" The word ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.
2. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" yields ""blue green green red green."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which maps to ""green""), and the output repeats the word for ""green.""
3. ""lug zup bluf dax"" leads to ""blue yellow yellow green."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""zup"" (which maps to ""yellow""), so the output consists of ""yellow"" twice.
4. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" (which results in ""yellow"") and is thus repeated in the output.
5. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Similar to the other examples, ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the preceding color, ""yellow.""

Given this pattern, we can deduce:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the previous color word in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and outputs, focusing on the instances where ""walm"" appears.

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which is blue, and ""zup"" which is yellow.
   
2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup  
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which is green, and ""zup"" which is yellow.
   
3. Input: zup wif dax walm  
   Output: yellow red green green green
   
   Here, ""walm"" is at the end. Notably, ""dax,"" which is green, precedes ""walm.""
   
4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm  
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
   Here, ""walm"" appears twice, and each time it is preceded by ""dax"" which is green. The outputs following ""walm"" are green regardless of the words that come after.
   
5. Input: dax walm zup  
   Output: green green green yellow
   
   Again, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" which is green, and is followed by ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Looking at these examples, the word ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding words. While there is a pattern that ""walm"" often follows ""dax"" which also translates to green, every instance of ""walm"" results in the word ""green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" specifically means ""green.""

Rule: walm -> green

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,91
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" This is consistent across all instances where ""lug"" appears in the input:

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue (lug corresponds to the first blue)

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow (lug corresponds to blue)

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green (lug corresponds to the first blue)

Input: lug
Output: blue (lug is the only word, and the output is blue)

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue (lug corresponds to the first and last blue)

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue
Analyzing the Input/Output pairs provided:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

2. lug dax walm -> blue green green green

3. wif lug dax -> red blue green

4. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red

5. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow

Notice that in every output where the input includes the word ""dax,"" the corresponding output color is green. The word ""dax"" does not seem to be context-dependent, as its output color is always green regardless of its position or the neighboring words.

Rule: When the input features the word ""dax,"" the output includes the color green at the respective position of the word ""dax.""

dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color red. Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. The context does not indicate that ""wif"" changes meaning based on position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in each example, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in correspondence between the inputs and outputs. Let's see how bluf is represented across the different inputs and outputs:

- Input: dax lug wif bluf | Output: green blue red red
- Input: lug wif bluf | Output: blue red red
- Input: wif zup bluf wif dax | Output: red yellow yellow red green
- Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf | Output: yellow green yellow green red red
- Input: zup bluf wif lug dax | Output: yellow yellow red blue green

In all instances, the presence of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red appearing twice in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to two instances of the color red in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> ""red red""
Considering the given examples, I will determine the pattern through comparison and attempt to discover the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

Let's break down each example and see if we can identify any patterns:

1. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   
2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   
3. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   
4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

From these examples, we can notice that each instance of ""walm"" is followed by the colour that was triggered by the preceding word, repeated three times.

For instance:
- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""walm"" leads to three more greens.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the sequence of three yellows occurs.
- In the third, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" again, yielding three greens after a blue associated with ""lug.""
- The fourth shows ""wif"" prior to ""walm,"" and as a result, we get two more reds.
- Finally, in the fifth, each occurrence of ""walm"" follows this pattern based on the colour associated with the word just before it.

Therefore, the rule I can derive is:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat three additional times.

So,

walm -> Repeats the color induced by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True,92
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning or the rule pertaining to the nonce word 'dax,' let's look at each example and find the commonality:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

3. Input: dax lug dax
   Output: green blue green

4. Input: dax lug dax wif dax
   Output: green blue green red green

5. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

By observing the color output sequence with respect to the position of 'dax', the following pattern can be noticed:

- Whenever 'dax' occurs, it is followed by the color green.
- The color preceding 'dax' appears to influence the color output immediately before the green that corresponds to 'dax'.
  - If 'dax' follows 'wif', the output is red.
  - If 'dax' follows 'lug', the output is blue.
  - If 'dax' follows something other than 'wif' or 'lug' (like 'zup'), the preceding color is yellow.

Given that 'dax' consistently results in the color green, and that the word immediately preceding 'dax' influences the color that comes just before green, it seems that 'dax' operates as a trigger for the color green, while also being dependent on the preceding context for the color output just before the green it triggers.

Rule: 'dax' -> triggers the color green in the output, with the preceding color adjusted according to the word immediately before it: red if preceded by 'wif', blue if preceded by 'lug', yellow if preceded by any other word.
Given the examples, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif."" It appears before every other word or pair of items, none of which seem meaningfully related in English, but consistently map to specific colors in the output. Let's examine each case:

Example 1:
Input: wif lug 
Output: red blue 
- ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue.""

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf 
Output: red red 
- ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" which maps to ""red.""

Example 3:
Input: wif bluf lug zup 
Output: red red blue yellow 
- ""wif"" precedes a sequence that includes ""bluf"" (red), ""lug"" (blue), and ""zup"" (yellow).

Example 4:
Input: wif dax bluf 
Output: red green green 
- ""wif"" precedes a sequence that includes ""dax"" (green) followed by ""bluf"" (red, but repeated as green).

Example 5:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup 
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""wif"" precedes a sequence including ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" (unknown, but perhaps ""yellow"" since every unknown word is translated to ""yellow""), ""dax"" (green), and another ""zup"" (yellow).

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" when appearing at the beginning of a sequence, always results in ""red"" at the start of the output. Then every other word in the input after ""wif"" is mapped to a specific color, with ""lug"" being ""blue,"" ""bluf"" being ""red,"" ""zup"" being ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" being ""green."" Any unknown word after ""wif"" has appeared seems to default to ""yellow,"" which could either be part of the rule for ""wif"" or simply a placeholder for unrecognized words.

The rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" signals the start of a sequence where ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and subsequent words are mapped to specific predetermined colors, with unknown words mapping to ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following associations:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Therefore, we can infer that ""zup"" refers to the color yellow, with each input word corresponding to a specific color output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf corresponds to the output color that matches the previous color mentioned. 

If we follow this rule:

- In the first example, ""dax"" results in ""green,"" therefore bluf, which comes before, translates to ""red"" since it follows ""wif.""
- In the second example, bluf follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" so bluf also translates to yellow.
- In the third example, bluf follows ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" thus bluf also becomes ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, bluf is between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" which are ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively. Since ""wif"" comes first, bluf translates to ""red"" (the same as ""wif"").
- In the fifth example, bluf follows ""lug"" (blue), so it translates to ""blue,"" matching the preceding color.

Hence, bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf is the color that corresponds to the word immediately proceeding it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the preceding word. Each instance of ""walm"" leads to the previous word’s associated color output being repeated three times.

Let's review the examples and deduce the rule:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""zup's"" color is yellow, which is repeated three times.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" here, and ""dax's"" color is green, which is repeated three times, followed by ""wif's"" color, red.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""zup's"" color, yellow, is repeated three times, enclosed by ""lug's"" color, blue, at both ends.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
In this sequence, ""walm"" again follows ""zup,"" and we see that ""zup's"" color, yellow, is repeated three times, with preceding words ""wif"" and ""dax"" having their associated colors, red and green.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
Here, ""walm"" is used twice. Each time it follows ""wif,"" and accordingly, the color red is repeated three times after each ""walm."" Also, after ""zup"" and ""lug,"" we see their respective colors, and at the end, after the last ""walm,"" the color associated with ""zup"" is repeated.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,93
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning can be the color blue.

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
By analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to determine the rule for the nonce word ""dax.""

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Rule: ""dax"" by itself corresponds to the color ""green.""

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: In this sequence, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green."" The words before and after ""dax"" correspond to other colors.

3. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   Rule: In a two-word sequence, ""dax"" follows the preceding word color, which here is ""red,"" and ""dax"" remains ""green.""

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   Rule: ""dax"" follows a sequence of colors and remains ""green."" The word after ""dax"" (""bluf"") does not seem to affect ""dax,"" as it also translates to ""green.""

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   Rule: Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""dax"" keeps translating to ""green.""

Given the examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in a string of words. It does not seem to affect or be affected by the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" triggers a pattern in the outputs, which reflects the inputs in a certain way. 

In the first input, ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the second input, ""lug zup dax wif"" outputs ""blue yellow green red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and again ""wif"" to ""red.""

In the third input, ""dax walm wif walm"" outputs ""green green green red red red."" Each occurrence of ""dax"" and ""walm"" before ""wif"" corresponds to a ""green,"" and ""wif"" itself - being present once - still corresponds to ""red."" After ""wif,"" each ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the fourth input, we see the same output for ""zup wif"" as in the first example, confirming the consistency of ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

In the fifth input, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" outputs ""green green red blue yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""wif,"" the pattern restarts with ""lug"" and ""zup"" once again corresponding to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

From these examples, one might induce that ""wif"" serves as a kind of delimiter or reset point in the sequence, after which the color pattern, linked to the respective nonce words, restarts. Before ""wif,"" each nonce word translates to a color, and ""wif"" itself consistently translates to ""red."" Interestingly, ""wif"" seems to signal a starting over of the pattern, given that nonce words after ""wif"" start again with their respective color outputs independent of what was before ""wif."" 

Rule: wif -> red, and restarts the color pattern after its occurrence.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" Since ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green,"" and ""dax bluf"" results in a repetition of ""green,"" this suggests that ""bluf"" may imply a repetition or duplication of the preceding color word's output.

2. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" We see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The ""bluf"" following ""zup"" results in the repetition of ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup.""

3. ""zup wif bluf"" yields ""yellow red red."" The presence of ""bluf"" after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" results in a repeated ""red.""

4. ""zup lug bluf"" turns into ""yellow blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" after ""lug"" (which means ""blue"") again causes a repetition of ""blue.""

5. In ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" the output is ""blue red red blue red."" After ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" causes a repetition of ""red"" once again.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" results in the duplication or repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color word that comes before it.
The examples show a consistent pattern that allows us to figure out what ""walm"" might mean:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color mentioned before it three times.

For example:
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (since ""zup"" means ""yellow"")
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" includes ""lug walm"" right after ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color word before it three times. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, output the corresponding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,94
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided, regardless of the words that precede or follow it in the inputs.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:
- Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output includes the color ""red.""
- ""wif"" appears to be a stand-alone element that maps directly to ""red"" when it is the only word in the input.
- When ""wif"" is combined with other words (e.g., ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax""), it seems to map to ""red,"" plus the corresponding colors for those words.

Here is the breakdown of the examples given:
- ""zup wif lug dax"" includes ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" which maps to ""blue,"" ""dax"" which maps to ""green,"" and finally ""wif"" which maps to ""red.""
- ""lug wif"" includes ""lug"" which maps to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" which maps to ""red.""
- ""wif"" alone maps directly to ""red.""
- ""zup walm wif"" includes ""zup"" and ""walm"" which both map to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" which maps to ""red.""

Therefore, wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" maps to the color ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the provided examples.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - Here, ""dax"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""green."" After ""zup"" comes the sequence ""yellow blue.""

2. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   - ""dax"" is ""green"" again, but ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

3. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - Directly after ""zup"" comes ""yellow blue.""

4. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

5. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is ""green."" Post ""zup,"" the pattern ""yellow"" repeats the number of times ""walm"" appears.

From the examples above, it is apparent that when ""zup"" appears, the color that is generated is ""yellow,"" followed by a sequence dependent on the word that comes after ""zup.""

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" may be that it signals a change in the sequence; specifically, it introduces the color ""yellow"" and potentially sets a pattern for following words.

Rule: ""zup"" -> introduces the color ""yellow,"" followed by a pattern that seems to depend on the subsequent words.
bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in an input, the output is the color that corresponds to the word that comes just before ""bluf,"" repeated twice.
- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so the output is ""blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so the output is ""red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so the output is ""green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again, and the output is ""yellow yellow.""
To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Now, let's examine the outputs where ""walm"" appears:

In example 1, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue"". Then it appears after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". 

In example 2, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and the output is again ""blue blue"".

In example 3, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and the output is ""green green"".

In example 4, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

In example 5, ""walm"" appears on its own after ""zup"" and the output is once again ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Examining the contexts in which ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output colors, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word thrice. 

For example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"". Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". And ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", making ""dax walm"" output ""green green green"".

Rule: The word ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

So:
walm -> meaning. Meaning: Walm repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm dax
    ",Output: red red red green,red red red green,True,95
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" translates to the output ""green"". To ensure that our rule covers all examples, let's see if there is any other pattern related to the appearance of ""dax"":

1. lug dax -> blue green
2. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. wif walm dax -> red red red green
5. wif dax -> red green

In all instances, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Additionally, the other words correspond to their own colours (although those rules are not requested). There seems to be no additional context or condition that alters the meaning of ""dax"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the examples and their corresponding outputs:

- dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- wif zup -> red yellow
- lug wif dax -> blue red green
- wif dax -> red green
- wif lug -> red blue

From the given examples, we can determine the following:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- ""wif"" appears before another word (for example, ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug""), and the output for those words follow the ""red"" for ""wif"" in the output sequence (yellow after ""zup,"" green after ""dax,"" and blue after ""lug"").
- ""wif"" doesn't change outcomes of the words that follow it; it just inserts ""red"" before the colors that correspond to those following words.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" independently of the context. 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the occurrences of the nonce word ""zup"" and its corresponding output to determine its meaning.

In the first input-output pair:
- Using ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue.""
- Since ""lug"" on its own resulted in ""blue"" (seen in second and third examples), ""zup"" likely corresponds to ""yellow.""

In the second input-output pair:
- The pattern of ""zup"" occurrences generated ""yellow"" each time it was used.
- Following the word ""zup,"" the other words ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif,"" when appearing after ""zup,"" have consistent color outputs: ""walm"" => yellow, ""dax"" => green, and ""wif"" => red, independent of the presence of ""zup.""

In the third pair:
- ""dax lug zup"" leads to ""green blue yellow.""
- The order suggests ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and thus ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In the fourth pair:
- ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In the fifth pair:
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""; then ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- Since ""walm"" has already been established to correspond to ""yellow,"" ""zup"" is consistent with its previous occurrence, corresponding to ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can determine that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf.""

1. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   
Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" following ""dax"" and to ""yellow"" after ""zup"". This suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" might not be static, but could change depending on the preceding word.

2. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   
In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to the color ""red.""

3. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and also corresponds to the color ""red.""

4. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   
In this sequence, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" following ""lug.""

5. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes right before it:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it means ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it means ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the given examples are not consistent (""green"" in the first instance and no direct instance in further examples), suggesting that either there is insufficient information to define the rule for ""dax"" or there might have been a mistake in the first output.

Thus, the general rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence (with ""dax"" being an exception or error in the examples provided).
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the examples given:

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

By analyzing the examples:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is green green green.
- The color that precedes ""walm"" repeats 3 times in the output.
- Directly after ""walm,"" the color associated with the next word in the input is the color in the output.
- ""walm"" does not seem to generate its own unique color; instead, it causes the previous color to repeat thrice and then continues with the subsequent color.

Whether ""walm"" is before or after the color word doesn’t change the output.

For instance:

- ""dax walm zup"" generates ""green green green yellow,"" where ""green"" is the color for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red,"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- When ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence following ""wif,"" as in ""wif walm,"" the color ""red"" repeats three times.
- When ""walm"" is used in other contexts, the pattern still holds, as seen in ""lug zup walm lug"", which results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" with ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" and the sequence ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""zup walm lug.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Walm causes the previous color word to be repeated three times in the output, followed by the color associated with the next word (if there's one following it).

Rule: If a color word precedes ""walm,"" it is repeated thrice in the output; if there is a color word after ""walm,"" it continues as the next color in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red blue red red yellow,red blue red yellow yellow,False,96
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples, irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that each word before ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color, and the word ""dax"" itself always corresponds to the color ""green."" Here’s how the examples break down:

Example 1: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Example 2: ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green,"" suggesting ""wif"" and ""walm"" both correspond to the color ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Example 3: ""zup lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow red green,"" indicating ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Example 4: A repeat of Example 1, reinforcing that ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""

Example 5: ""lug zup dax lug"" translates to ""blue yellow green blue,"" which is consistent with the previous examples where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Therefore, we can deduce that regardless of context, the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for the corresponding outputs for each instance of ""wif"" in the given inputs. We should also look for patterns in the other words (""dax"", ""lug"", ""walm"", ""zup"") and their associated colors.

From the inputs and the outputs:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""wif"" appears after ""lug"" and the corresponding output is ""red,"" the same as for ""lug.""
- In example 2, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and the corresponding output is ""red.""
- In example 4, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and the corresponding output is ""red.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" appears after ""walm"" and the corresponding output is ""red.""

The other words appear to be associated with consistent colors:
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> yellow (except when followed by ""wif"")

When ""wif"" follows any word, the output color is ""red."" There is not enough information to identify a secondary pattern (such as when ""wif"" stands alone, as it also results in ""red""). Therefore, the best rule that can be determined from the given data is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. 

Here are the examples again, with this interpretation:

Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
(wif = red, zup = yellow, dax = green, bluf = green)

Input: lug wif zup wif -> Output: blue red yellow red
(lug = blue, wif = red, zup = yellow, wif = red)

Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
(zup = yellow, lug = blue)

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
(zup = yellow, walm = yellow)

Input: zup -> Output: yellow
(zup = yellow)

Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" translates directly to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> blue blue

Explanation: In each given input, the output for the word ""bluf"" is ""blue blue"". The repetition of the color ""blue"" twice for the word ""bluf"" suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" irrespective of the context in which it is used.
To identify the meaning or rule of the nonce word 'walm', we must look for patterns in the provided examples that include the word 'walm' and the resultant outputs.

We can start by breaking down the first example:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

In this example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'. Since 'bluf' results in 'blue', we can infer it is likely a misspelling or variation of 'lug'. This would make 'walm' correspond to three instances of 'blue'.

Let's check the second example:

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'lug' to 'blue'. Following 'lug', we see 'walm' and in the output, we have three instances of 'blue'. This adheres to the pattern we saw from example 1.

Now, let's check the third example:

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

Based on previous examples, 'wif' is 'red', 'lug' and 'bluf' are 'blue'. The word 'walm' correlates with two instances of 'red' in this example. This seems to be a deviation from the first two examples.

Moving on to the fourth example:

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

Here, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'wif' to 'red', 'dax' to 'green', and 'zup' to 'yellow'. 'walm' precedes 'zup' and corresponds to two instances of 'green' followed by 'yellow'. This does not match the prior association of 'walm' with 'blue' or 'red'.

Lastly, let's examine the fifth example:

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

This example is identical to the second example and yields the same result, with 'walm' corresponding to three 'blue'.

Based on these observations, we can see that 'walm' appears to introduce repetition. However, the number of repetitions and color it produces is not consistent across the examples. To establish a definitive rule from these inconsistent examples is challenging, but there is a pattern of repetition and color association.

Examining more closely, it seems that 'walm' might be triggering a repetition of the color that comes right after 'walm' in the input sequence. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of 'walm' appearances plus one. This theory is consistent with examples one, two, and five but not with three and four.

If we account for potential errors in examples three and four, we might conclude the following tentative rule:

Rule: 'walm' causes the next color word to repeat three times.

However, given the inconsistencies, more examples or information would be needed to solidify this rule. For now:

walm -> causes the next color to repeat multiple times (potentially three times based on consistent examples).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,97
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" is at both the beginning and the end of the sequence, and both times it corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, although there are multiple colors and words, ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the last example, ""lug"" is again translated to ""blue"".

Based on this consistent pattern across all examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Dax in each example yields the output ""green."" However, it's important to notice that the color outputs correspond with the input words in a way that each word appears to be related to a specific color. For example, we can infer that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and in a sequence, each word is followed by its color equivalent. 

With that being said, the inferred rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: Each nonce word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. ""Dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" no matter where it appears in the sequence of words.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze the patterns in each example.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: dax zup dax zup wif
Output: green yellow green yellow red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

It's not immediately discernible what ""wif"" stands for because we do not have a clear context, except that it is part of a sequence involving other nonce words (zup, walm, dax, bluf) with corresponding colors. However, we can try to infer the meaning based on the data provided.

Looking at the outputs, each nonce word seems to correspond to a particular color:
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf is mentioned once and is followed by yellow in the output sequence.

""Wif"" appears in the examples and is consistently followed by the color red, except in the second example where it's the first word and followed by red. If we interpret this consistently across all examples, the simplest explanation that fits is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Rule: zup means ""yellow"". Every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to a color that matches the color assigned to the word immediately preceding it. It is important to note that the word ""bluf"" itself doesn't have an intrinsic color meaning but derives its meaning from the context it is used in. Here is the rule derived from each input and output combination:

- wif dax bluf -> red green green (bluf mimics the color of ""dax"" which is green)
- dax wif bluf -> green red red (bluf mimics the color of ""wif"" which is red)
- wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red (bluf mimics the color of ""wif"" which is red)
- dax bluf -> green green (bluf mimics the color of ""dax"" which is green)
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf mimics the color of ""zup"" which is yellow)

Rule: bluf -> adopts the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
The examples provided suggest a pattern where the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Each preceding word seems to have a corresponding color:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Following this pattern:

- ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green"". The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, so the output is ""green"" repeated three times after the initial ""red blue green.""
  
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". The word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and thus the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
  
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
  
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" is slightly irregular as ""bluf"" doesn't have a consistent output, but following ""wif"" which outputs red, ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".
  
- ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" so it repeats the color green three times, and then the sequence ends with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow.

Combining these insights, we get:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax
    ",Output: green yellow green,green yellow green,True,98
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In every example, the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we'll look at the consistent patterns present in the examples provided:

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

Looking at these examples, ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. All other words have a one-to-one correspondence with different colors, and their output colors remain consistent except for ""dax.""

Therefore, based on the information given, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can infer that each 'nonce' word (a word not previously known) translates to a specific color. In each example where the nonce word ""wif"" appears, the output includes the color red. Here is the observed correspondence:

1. ""wif lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow"": **wif** corresponds to **red**.
2. ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green"": **wif** corresponds to **red**.
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": **wif** corresponds to **red**.
4. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"": **wif** corresponds to **red**.
5. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue"": **wif** corresponds to **red**.

Hence, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following associations:

- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"".
- ""walm"" also consistently results in ""green"", except when it is preceded by ""wif"", which changes the result to ""red"".
- Every instance of ""zup"" yields ""yellow"".

To further deduce the meaning of ""zup"", we notice:

- Whether ""zup"" is by itself or with another word, the result is ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" doesn't seem to be context-dependent, as it results in ""yellow"" no matter its position (beginning, middle, or end).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be consistent and can be defined as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", independent of its position or context within the given input.
bluf -> repeats the color associated with the previous word.

Rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""red,"" so ""bluf"" produces another ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" so ""bluf"" produces another ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" so ""bluf"" produces another ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" produces another ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times. Below is the analysis:

1. ""wif walm lug bluf"" outputs as ""red red red blue blue,"" where ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue."" We notice that ""red"" is repeated three times instead of once, associated with the presence of ""walm.""

2. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" Here, both ""wif"" and ""dax"" appear to correspond to single colors, ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. However, ""red"" is again repeated three times, pointing to the effect of ""walm.""

3. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow."" The color ""yellow"" is repeated three times, which is the output after the introduction of ""walm.""

4. ""zup dax walm"" leads to ""yellow green green green,"" where the color corresponding to ""dax"" (""green"") is repeated three times, following the introduction of ""walm"" in the sequence.

5. Similarly, ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red,"" where ""red"" is the color repeated three times due to the presence of ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:
Walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears after a color-indicating word, the output is that color repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup
    ",Output: blue blue blue yellow,blue blue blue yellow,True,99
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that:

- The input ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears alongside other nonce words, it still results in the output ""green,"" but the addition of other words corresponds to additional colors. For example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

dax -> green

The meaning of ""dax"" in this context seems to correspond with the color green.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" is mentioned, the output starts with ""red.""

Now let's verify this rule across all the examples:

1. Input: zup dax zup wif
   Output: yellow green yellow red
   
   Here the word ""wif"" appears at the end of the sequence and the last color is ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   
   The word ""wif"" is at the beginning here, and the output starts with ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
   ""wif"" at the beginning corresponds to a ""red"" at the beginning of the output again.

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   
   Here, ""wif"" leads to ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   
   And in this final example, ""wif"" also leads to a red color output.

Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

This means ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- When ""zup"" is present with ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf,"" it corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The sequence or presence of other words does not seem to impact the meaning assigned to ""zup.""
- ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when in sequence with other nonce words, each nonce word has its own consistent corresponding color.

From the examples, we don't have a case where the meaning of ""zup"" is dependent on context or changes based on the words around it. It always corresponds to the same color.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""bluf"" is translated into a color, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule that dictates what ""bluf"" corresponds to.

Here's the analysis of each input and its output:

1. dax wif bluf -> green red red
2. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

Looking at these examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to always result in the color ""red"". However, there's one example that does not fit this pattern exactly:

- Example 2: wif bluf lug -> red red blue

In this example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", not ""bluf"". Therefore, we cannot state a rule that ""bluf"" translates directly to a fixed color since it does not hold true in all instances. Instead, let's examine if ""bluf"" may signify a transition or a change in pattern.

Looking closely, we can see that ""bluf"" is always associated with changing the previous color mentioned:

1. dax (green) wif (red) bluf (red)
2. wif (red) bluf (red) lug (blue)
3. wif (red) bluf (red) dax (green)
4. zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) wif (red) walm (red)
5. dax (green) zup (yellow) bluf (yellow)

However, the pattern does not remain consistent, as ""bluf"" does not always repeat the color that precedes it, nor does it always introduce a new color following it.

Given the lack of a consistent pattern that relates ""bluf"" to a specific color or to an action like repeating or changing the preceding color, it is difficult to establish a definitive meaning or rule for ""bluf"" based on the provided examples. One possibility is that ""bluf"" introduces the first color that appeared in the sequence, but there is not enough data to confirm this, especially since the third and fifth examples suggest otherwise.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is indeterminate given the current information. If there is a specific logic or rule behind this nonce word, additional data or examples would be required to accurately deduce it.

Rule: Indeterminate based on the provided examples. More data is required.
To deduce the rule for ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples.

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears twice; its corresponding color also appears twice, suggesting replication. ""Red"" follows ""walm"" both times.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and three ""red""s follow, meaning ""walm"" could involve the repetition of the color corresponding to ""wif.""

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Analysis: Adding ""lug"" at the end introduces ""blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" is independent of ""walm."" ""Walm"" continues to cause the color associated with ""wif"" to repeat three times.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Analysis: ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" again repeating ""red"" three times. The placement of ""walm"" appears to be independent of its rule, as the repeated color corresponds to the word directly preceding ""walm.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: Here, ""walm"" is at the end, and ""blue"" repeats three times. The color that ""walm"" causes to be repeated three times correlates with the word right before it (""lug"" -> ""blue"").

Based on the analysis, ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the directly preceding word to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug zup bluf wif bluf
    ",Output: red blue yellow yellow red red,red blue yellow yellow red red,True,100
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each instance it appears within the examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: green. Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to infer the meaning of ""wif"". To do this, we need to first look for a pattern in the examples provided:

1. In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red"". Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", it seems that ""wif"" may mean repeating the color mentioned directly before it.

2. In the second example, ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red"". As ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" acts as a change to ""red"", but without repetition, it's difficult to affirm the initial rule deduced from example 1.

3. In the third example, ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red"".

4. In the fourth example, ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue"".

5. In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"". Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", which hasn't appeared on its own, making it difficult to determine what ""walm"" means. But with ""wif"" leading, the output is ""red red red,"" suggesting a repetition of the color ""red"" that is associated with ""wif"".

Combining these different uses of ""wif"", we can posit that ""wif"" carries the meaning of ""red"" when it appears on its own. When followed by another word, it seems to dictate that the color corresponding to ""wif"" (""red"") should be repeated as many times as the instances following ""wif"".

So, the rule could be inferred as:

Rule: When ""wif"" appears on its own, it means ""red"". When followed by another word, it repeats the color ""red"" as many times as the instance(s) of the word that comes after ""wif"" in the sequence.

Thus:
wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In each example, whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence. This consistent mapping suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"".
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the relationship between the input and output in each example.

For the first example:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

In this case, ""lug"" triggers the output ""blue"" and ""walm"" also produces ""blue,"" shown by the repetition (three times).

For the second example:
Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

We see that ""dax"" seems to trigger the output ""green"" and ""wif"" produces ""red."" The word ""bluf"" seems related to ""bluff,"" but there are no clear indications of its meaning from this example alone. However, ""walm"" again results in the same color as the first word's output, shown by the three ""green"" in this case. 

For the third example:
Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

The appearance of ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" In this case, we have ""walm"" after ""wif,"" but ""walm"" seems to repeat the output linked to ""wif,"" as indicated by three additional ""red.""

For the fourth example:
Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Here ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" which is unique to this example, but ""walm"" follows suit with a triple ""yellow."" ""Wif"" continues to consistently trigger ""red.""

For the fifth example:
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

In this case, there's no new word, only ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" with ""wif"" triggering ""red"" and ""walm"" repeating it three times, as seen in prior examples.

Analyzing the outputs, it seems that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the preceding non-walm word and repeats it thrice. If ""walm"" is the second word in the input, it repeats the color of the first word. If it occurs later, it repeats the color of the word just before it. There are no examples to deduce the behavior of ""walm"" if it's the first word in the input or if it follows another ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color associated with the preceding non-walm word three times.""

Based on the examples given:

- If ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" produce ""blue blue blue.""
- If ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" produce ""green green green.""
- If ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" produce ""red red red.""
- If ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" produce ""yellow yellow yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided outputs.
From examining the examples, it is possible to induce that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and it is inferred that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug zup dax zup -> Output: blue yellow green yellow
Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" reinforcing the pattern.

Input: dax zup dax zup -> Output: green yellow green yellow
""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" which is consistent with earlier examples.

Input: dax zup dax zup wif -> Output: green yellow green yellow red
The new word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while the pattern for ""dax"" and ""zup"" holds.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently result in the output ""red."" It does not appear to matter what other words (""walm"", ""zup"", ""bluf"", ""dax"", ""lug"") are in the input or their associated colors (""red"", ""yellow"", ""green"", ""blue""); whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" is present in the output. There is also no indication that the number of times ""wif"" appears affects the number of times ""red"" appears — it is a one-to-one correspondence.

Therefore, the rule appears to be: 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The other words must correspond to other colors, but you are specifically asking about the meaning of ""zup"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify any patterns or correlations within the given examples. Let's examine each provided pair of inputs and outputs closely:

1. dax wif bluf -> green red red
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Looking at these inputs and outputs, we notice that:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- However, when ""dax"" appears before ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" (""dax wif bluf""), the output is not a straightforward triple color, but rather ""green red red."" This suggests the word that appears before ""bluf"" determines the color that is repeated twice in the output, and for ""dax"" followed by ""wif,"" ""dax"" does not impact the color associated with ""bluf.""

Given these observations and the consistency of the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated twice in the output sequence.

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule appears to be:
- ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word twice.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in replicating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Each time ""walm"" is mentioned, the corresponding color of the previous word is repeated three times in the output.

Here's how the rule breaks down for each example:

1. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
   ""Dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.

2. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
   ""Wif"" is associated with the color red, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow
   The color associated with ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice. ""Lug"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, following their first occurrences.

4. Input: lug walm zup walm -> Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   The color associated with ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice, then ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and the second ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.

5. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
   The color associated with ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice. The color associated with ""dax"" is green and comes after the repetitions.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow green red blue,green yellow yellow yellow green red blue,True,102
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of context within the provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is always ""green"". There is no variation in this pattern, thus it is clear that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the list of words or the words that surround it.
Based on the input and output examples given, we can attempt to induce the meaning of wif and its relationship to colors. Here is the analysis:

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

From the first example, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

The second example also supports this, as adding another word ""bluf"" associated with a color does not change the output for ""wif"".

In the third example, additional words ""lug walm"" result in multiple ""blue"" in the output, which could indicate either repetition or pluralization in the nonce language.

In the fourth and fifth examples, ""zup"" and ""dax"" relate to distinct colors yellow and green, respectively, which are different from the repetition or pluralization pattern in the third example.

With this information, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates consistently to ""red"". Meanwhile, other nonce words might correspond to other colors or additional rules like repetition or pluralization not yet fully understood from the examples provided.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule would be:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the immediately preceding word. Here is how ""bluf"" behaves in accordance with each example:

- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".
- ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" results in ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"", so the first ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""lug"" which is ""blue"", and the second ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".
- ""dax bluf lug wif"" results in ""green green blue red"", so ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""dax"" which is ""green"".
- ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".
- ""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green"", so ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the word immediately before it.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color word prior to its appearance. Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- Example 2: ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red"", indicating that ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.
- Example 3: ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" makes ""blue"" be repeated.
- Example 4: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"", ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated twice here, note the sequence change.
- Example 5: ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", hence ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated.

Given that the repetitions vary with the presence of ""walm"" and the color word beforehand, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a color word, it repeats that color word in the output three times, resulting in a sequence of three of the same color, if there is no interrupting word. If there is an interrupting word after ""walm"" (like ""lug"" or ""dax""), then ""walm"" might just duplicate the preceding color twice, followed by the new sequence of color words.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word two or three times in the output, contingent on the presence and position of intervening words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the given context consistently translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" The other words (""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf"") seem to correspond with other colors, and the position of ""dax"" in the input does not affect its output color.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each given example. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
From the examples provided, each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"". Here is how ""zup"" relates to ""yellow"" in each input and output pair:

- In the first example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow red red blue"" and ""zup"" is directly translated to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" again, even when surrounded by other words that translate to colors.
- The third and fourth examples, ""lug zup"" and ""lug zup"" both correspond to ""blue yellow"", indicating a consistent mapping from ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
- The last example, ""dax bluf zup"", maps to ""green green yellow"", where ""zup"" is again ""yellow"".

Therefore, regardless of the context or position within a sequence of words, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". Here is the rule based on the given examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze how it affects the output based on the given examples:

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" -> green; ""bluf"" -> green

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" -> blue; ""walm"" is absent in the output which suggests it might be a null operation; ""wif"" -> red; ""bluf"" succeeding ""lug"" -> blue, but ""bluf"" succeeding ""wif"" -> blue again, which violates the previously deduced rule of ""wif"" associating with red. 

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""wif"" -> red; ""bluf"" -> red; ""lug"" -> blue.

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow
- ""wif"" -> red; ""lug"" -> blue; ""bluf"" -> blue; ""zup"" -> yellow.

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green
- ""lug"" -> blue; ""wif"" -> red; ""dax"" -> green; ""bluf"" -> green.

From these examples, we can observe:
- ""dax"" consistently translates to green.
- ""lug"" consistently translates to blue.
- ""wif"" consistently translates to red.
- ""bluf"" has resulted in green twice and blue three times.

Looking at the patterns, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word immediately before it:

- When preceded by ""dax"" (which translates to green), ""bluf"" gives green.
- When preceded by ""wif"" or ""lug"" (translating to red and blue respectively), ""bluf"" results in blue, regardless of the color associated with the preceding word. It's worth noting that ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" three times and follows ""wif"" only once. However, the ""bluf"" after ""wif"" does not result in red, but blue, indicating it might take on a distinct color (blue) regardless of the previous word or is influenced by another not yet identified rule.

Given the ambiguity and the limited dataset, the best conclusion we can draw is:

Rule: Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" results in the same color as the preceding word except when that word translates to red, in which case ""bluf"" becomes blue. 

Hence, if we generalize this observation into a rule:

bluf -> meaning. 
Rule: ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word preceding it, but defaults to blue when preceded by a word that maps to red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns where the word appears:

1. In the first example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""red."" The word ""walm"" appears once, and its corresponding color is ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""dax walm lug"" becomes ""green green green blue."" Here, we again have ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue."" The appearance of ""walm"" is again followed by ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" The appearance of ""walm"" is followed by ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" We consistently see ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. After the appearance of ""walm,"" the colors turn to ""blue.""

5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup walm"" turns into ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The appearance of ""walm"" is followed by the repetition of the previously mentioned color.

The pattern for ""walm"" seems to be that when ""walm"" is encountered, the color that follows is the same as the color before ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> the word that follows ""walm"" is repeated in the corresponding color sequence of the word before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Output: green yellow blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the input and output provided in each example. We'll look for patterns that can establish the rules governing this word.

Example Analysis:

1) Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
2) Input: wif dax zup -> Output: red green yellow
3) Input: wif -> Output: red
4) Input: wif walm zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
5) Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Based on these examples, we can induce the following patterns:

- Every time the word ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- The presence of ""wif"" seems to induce a repeated color output for the following words.
  - For example, in example 4, ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""walm"" which correlates to three instances of ""red,"" and then ""zup"" correlates to three instances of ""yellow.""
  - In example 5, ""wif"" comes after ""lug"" and ""walm,"" but the output corresponding to ""wif"" is ""red,"" then the next word ""lug"" is repeated twice as ""blue.""
- The output patterns suggest that ""wif"" serves as a trigger for repetition in the sequence that follows it, but does not by itself determine the number of repetitions, only that there will be repetition.

Therefore, we can deduce the following:

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" triggers a color repeats in the output, with the number of repetitions and the color itself determined by the subsequent words.

Rule: When ""wif"" appears in the input, the next word's corresponding color output is repeated until a new word appears. ""wif"" itself corresponds to ""red."" If ""wif"" is the only word in the input, the output is a single instance of ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word in the ""Input"" corresponds to a color in the ""Output"". To determine the meaning of ""zup"", we should look for a consistent pattern across all provided examples.

Analyzing the examples:

- ""dax zup bluf"" maps to ""green yellow yellow""
- ""dax zup"" maps to ""green yellow""
- ""zup wif"" maps to ""yellow red""
- ""zup wif zup dax"" maps to ""yellow red yellow green""
- ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow red green red red""

From these examples, ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" and ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red."" ""Bluf"" maps to red when following ""wif"" and yellow otherwise. We can infer that ""bluf"" switches meaning based on the preceding word. Meanwhile, ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the provided examples regarding the position of ""bluf"" and the resulting colors:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
5. dax bluf -> green green

Observations:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it results in a repetition of ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it results in a repetition of ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it results in a repetition of ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, the color before ""bluf"" is repeated.
- When ""bluf"" is not the last word in the sequence, we do not have an example of the pattern it creates with the following words, except for when ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" which gives ""red red green.""

From these observations, one potential rule regarding ""bluf"" could be:

Rule:
- ""Bluf"" causes the next word to be translated into its respective color twice if ""bluf"" comes before it, except for when ""bluf"" is the last word, in which case the color for the word just before ""bluf"" is repeated twice.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> When preceding a word, it causes the color corresponding to that word to be repeated twice in the output. When it is the last word in a sequence, it causes the color corresponding to the word just before it to be repeated twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in each input-output pair:

1. When ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" is given, the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" is producing three instances of ""blue.""

2. For the input ""wif lug dax walm,"" the output is ""red blue green green green."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""walm,"" there are three greens.

3. The input ""dax walm"" results in the output ""green green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" once again has three greens following it.

4. In the case of ""wif walm lug bluf,"" the output is ""red red red blue blue."" We see ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" has three reds before we return to colors associated with their corresponding words.

5. For ""lug walm dax,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" again has three blues.

Now, looking at these patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it three times in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that whatever color precedes it, it will produce that color three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Regardless of its position in a sequence, ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a specific color and that the sequence of colors in the output matches the sequence of words in the input. By comparing the examples, we can attempt to deduce the color that each word corresponds to, including the nonce word ""dax.""

Let's break down the word-to-color associations we can infer from the input-output pairs, excluding the unknown ""dax"" for now:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""bluf"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> green

In each example where ""dax"" appears, we can see it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" (green) and itself corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is between ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue), and in the output, it corresponds to ""green"" between ""red"" and ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow) and in the output, ""green"" is followed by ""yellow.""

Therefore, given the consistency in the output, it is reasonable to deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Specifically, whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output, following the pattern observed that other words like ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" correspond to colors (""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow). It's worth noting that ""bluf"" is always followed by ""red"" in the output, but it also leads to the word ""blue"" preceding it in the output. This may imply that ""bluf"" includes a rule that affects both the previous and the subsequent colors, but the examples given do not provide enough consistent context for the previous word's influence since ""bluf"" appears only as the first or the last word, but never in the middle of a sequence.

Rule: bluf -> red (While ""bluf"" seems to always translate to ""red,"" there is an observed correlation with ""blue"" preceding it, which could indicate an additional rule not yet fully understood with the given information).
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we must identify the patterns that correlate with the use of ""walm"" in the input and the transformation seen in the output. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   
In this example, notice that ""lug"" leads to three blues in the output, followed by ""walm"" which seems to switch the output to yellow, repeated thrice.

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
Here, ""dax"" leads to three greens, and ""wif"" after ""walm"" leads to red, followed by ""lug"" which produces blue and then ""dax"" returning to green. Note that ""walm"" does not have a color directly associated with it but seems to cause a change in the subsequent color sequence.

3. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   
""dax"" again correlates with green, and after ""walm"" the color changes to blue for ""lug.""

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   
Here, ""wif"" corresponds with red, ""zup"" with yellow, ""lug"" with blue, and ""dax"" with green. After the last ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the yellow.

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   
Once more, ""dax"" correlates with green, and after ""walm,"" the color changes to red for ""wif.""

Considering these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that whatever word follows ""walm"" will have its corresponding color triplet in the output. If there is no word following ""walm,"" no extra triplet is produced as seen in the third example.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next word's associated color to be outputted three times. If no word follows, no triplet is outputted.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,106
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce the following relationships:

- In the first example, ""lug"" appears in a sequence of four words and corresponds to the last ""red"" in the output.
- In the second and fourth examples where ""lug"" is presented alone, the output is ""blue.""
- In the third example, when ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output starts with ""blue"" and is followed by ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" appears twice and each time it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

From these examples, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, I deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue

Meaning: Lug corresponds to the color blue in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, other nonce words correspond with other color words: ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" and ""walm"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

Here, the rule seems to be a direct translation from nonce word to color word.

Rule: wif -> red
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"", we should look for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
2. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
3. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
4. Input: dax zup wif zup
   Output: green yellow red yellow
5. Input: zup dax lug dax
   Output: yellow green blue green

Analyzing these:

- Every time ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.
- ""zup"" stands alone in the second example and corresponds directly to ""yellow"" in the output.
- Even when the position of ""zup"" changes in the input string, the position of ""yellow"" in the output string changes identically.
- There is no instance where ""zup"" is present and ""yellow"" is absent from the output, nor is there a ""yellow"" without a ""zup"".

Based on these observations, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Here's how we can determine that:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is translated to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" yet ""bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" indicating that it is ""blue"" once again but repeated due to a rule not yet deduced.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" on its own also translates to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup lug zup,"" which translates to ""yellow blue yellow,"" and then after ""bluf,"" we have ""lug,"" which we know is ""blue."" This maintains the consistency of ""bluf"" meaning ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm."" We need to look for patterns in the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

Let's consider each example and note the pattern of colors corresponding to each word:

1. Input: lug walm 
   Output: blue blue blue

2. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

5. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

Now let's analyze:

- From Example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue.""
- From Example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow.""
- From Example 3, ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red.""
- From Example 4, ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspond to single instances of their respective colors, ""red"" and ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- From Example 5, ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green,"" and ""wif"" to a single ""red.""

After noting the patterns for words that occur singly (lug, dax, zup, wif), we can see that ""walm"" affects the number of times the color corresponding to the directly preceding word is repeated in the output.

Specifically, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that appears right before it to repeat three times. Here's how it maps out:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and in the output, we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times subsequently in the output.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times subsequently.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" leading to ""yellow"" being repeated three times, and when it follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" leading to ""green"" repeated three times, and when it follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

So, in rule format:

walm -> Repeat the preceding word's color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,107
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs to spot a pattern related to the word's position and the colors associated with it.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - Here, both instances of ""dax"" are followed by ""green"".
   
2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" once again.
   
3. Input: dax lug dax lug wif
   Output: green blue green blue red
   - Once more, every ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".

4. Input: wif dax lug
   Output: red green blue
   - ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" and is followed by ""green"".

5. Input: dax lug dax wif dax
   Output: green blue green red green
   - Each ""dax"" is associated with a ""green"".

By analyzing the pattern, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" appears, it is followed by the color ""green"" in the output. It seems that ""dax"" is directly associated with the color ""green"".

Rule:
dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Meaning based on the examples provided, where each nonce word seems to correspond to a color:

- wif corresponds to red.
- bluf corresponds to red.
- zup corresponds to yellow.
- lug corresponds to blue.
- dax corresponds to green.
- walm also corresponds to green.

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all provided examples.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for a consistent pattern between the input containing ""bluf"" and the corresponding output.

From the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow green yellow green red red
3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
5. Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow

Looking at the patterns, every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output includes a repeated color. In examples 1, 2, and 3, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and the output is ""red red."" In example 4, ""bluf"" stands alone and the output is ""green,"" a repetition of the color that preceded it (green from the translation of ""dax""). In example 5, ""bluf"" appears before ""zup"" but after ""wif,"" and the result starts with the repetition of ""wif"" (red red) followed by the color for ""zup"" (yellow).

From these observations, we can infer a rule with two parts. Firstly, ""bluf"" seems to cause the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output. Secondly, if ""bluf"" is the last word (and does not stand alone or is not preceded by another color word) following ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""

Bluf -> Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is at the end, the output is ""red red.""

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by a word that translates into a color, repeat that color in the output. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and is at the end, the output is ""red red.""
Based on the provided examples, we can determine that walm corresponds to a series of repeated color words that follow it, specifically the color that would ordinarily follow the nonce word before walm in the sequence. To solidify the rule, let's examine each example:

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
Analysis: The walm here follows wif, which corresponds to red, resulting in a repetition of red three times after wif.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: Here walm follows zup, which corresponds to yellow, resulting in yellow being repeated three times.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Analysis: Again, walm follows wif, which has been established to correspond to red, and thus it repeats the word red three times after this occurrence of wif.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
Analysis: walm first follows dax, which corresponds to green, producing three greens. Later, walm is preceded by lug, which corresponds to blue, resulting in three blues.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
Analysis: walm follows wif, thus it gives red three times as seen before.

Based on the patterns observed, the general rule seems to be that walm causes the color word of the immediate previous nonce word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> the color indicated by the preceding nonce word is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,108
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance. Each additional word in the input corresponds to a different color in the output, but the presence of ""lug"" consistently results in the color blue appearing in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output always contains the word ""green"" at the corresponding position.

This leads to the rule:

**Rule:** dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, each instance of a nonce word corresponds to a specific color. To determine what ""wif"" means, let's examine its occurrences and the output colors:

1. In example 1, ""dax wif lug"" maps to ""green red blue."" ""Dax"" consistently maps to green, and ""lug"" consistently maps to blue across all examples. Therefore, ""wif"" in this context must map to red.

2. In example 2, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" maps to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" As before, ""lug"" consistently maps to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and since ""wif"" precedes a red color each time it appears, it further supports that ""wif"" maps to red.

3. In example 3, ""wif zup dax bluf"" maps to ""red yellow green green."" Here, ""zup"" maps to yellow and ""dax"" to green. Since ""wif"" is followed by red, it is consistent with previous examples.

4. Example 4 showcases ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" mapping to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" Here again, when ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output color is red.

5. Finally, example 5, ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" is mapped to ""blue green green red green."" By this pattern, ""wif"" again leads to red.

Rule: Each nonce word in the input seems to be a place-holder for colors; ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red regardless of its position in the sentence.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to indicate that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Here is the consistent rule observed:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color immediately preceding it in the sequence.

For instance:

- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow"" (bluf takes the color of 'zup' which is ""yellow"")
- ""wif lug bluf"" -> ""red blue blue"" (bluf takes the color of 'lug' which is ""blue"")
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (bluf takes the color of 'zup' which is ""yellow"")
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" (bluf takes the color of 'lug' which is ""blue"")
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" (bluf takes the color of 'lug' which is ""blue"")

Bluf -> the same color as the word before it.
From the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule by analyzing the consistency of inputs and corresponding outputs.

1. Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""
2. Input: ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red""
3. Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
4. Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" (repeated) -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
5. Input: ""lug walm"" (repeated) -> Output: ""blue blue blue""

There appears to be a direct relation between the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input and a repetition in the corresponding color in the output. Specifically, each appearance of the word ""walm"" is translated into a triple repeat of a color in the output.

- ""lug walm"" consistently results in ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""walm"" corresponds to a rule that makes the color blue repeat three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" results in one yellow followed by three reds, which implies that ""walm"" may not have an inherent color but instead dictates the color that precedes it to be repeated.
- Adding ""lug"" to ""zup wif walm"" introduces ""blue"" at the end of the output sequence, further indicating that ""lug"" might be tied to ""blue,"" while ""walm"" still causes a repetition of the color that directly precedes its own repetition (in this case, red).

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the preceding color word to repeat three times in the output. If no color word precedes it, then it repeats the most recent color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,109
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the examples given, here's the breakdown of each:

1. dax lug -> green blue
2. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
3. lug zup -> blue yellow
4. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

Based on this information, it consistently appears that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each time ""lug"" is input, the output includes the word ""blue"" in the same position.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can hypothesize the following rule:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
- Other words like ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the colors ""red,"" ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively. These words seem to maintain their associated colors regardless of their position in the input.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" in the given context is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". The other words in the examples (""zup"" and ""lug"") correspond to colors as well, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""Dax"" appears to correlate with the color ""green"" and ""bluf"" might either be a repetition of the color ""green"" or simply an emphasis that doesn't affect the color output (since it precedes ""wif"", which is known, and is followed by a sequence that is consistent with other examples).

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in each instance it appears.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems context-dependent. When ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug,"" the output is ""blue""; however, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" 

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" If ""bluf"" is preceded by any other word or is at the beginning of a sequence, the rule is not clear from the examples given.
Based on the examples provided, walm seems to be associated with a sequence of recurring colors, specifically the repetition of the color that precedes it.

In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". Since ""lug"" produces ""blue"", and ""walm"" follows, causing two additional ""blue"" outputs, it implies that ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the word before it.

This is further supported by the second example ""lug dax walm wif"", which results in ""blue green green green red"". Again, ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color of ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Following this pattern:

- In ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" causes a triplication of ""red"".
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" triplicates ""blue"".
- In ""dax walm wif walm"", ""walm"" first triples the ""green"" from ""dax"", and then ""wif"" produces ""red"" with the subsequent ""walm"" triplicating ""red"".

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the directly preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,110
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" correlates to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence. The color mentioned immediately after ""dax"" corresponds directly with the other words in the sequence. For example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow.
Inspecting the examples closely, we can determine the rule for the term ""wif"" by aligning the inputs with the respective outputs:

1. lug zup wif zup => blue yellow red yellow
   Here, 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm => green red yellow yellow red red red
   'wif' yields 'red' after 'dax' and before 'zup', and it yields 'red red red' after 'bluf', before 'walm'.

3. dax wif walm lug zup => green red red red blue yellow
   'wif' gives 'red red red' before 'walm'.

4. wif dax => red green
   'wif' stands alone as 'red' before 'dax'.

5. wif bluf lug => red red blue
   'wif' appears as 'red red' before 'bluf'.

Comparing across all examples, it seems that the word 'wif' translates to 'red', but it also affects the color associated with the word following it, repeating the color of the next word in the output if it is not 'zup'. In the case that the next word is 'zup', 'wif' remains just 'red'. 

This provides us with a consistent rule:

Rule: wif -> 'red', and repeat the color of the following word unless the next word is 'zup'.
Using the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the sentence, the output always includes ""yellow"" whenever ""zup"" appears in the input. Various other words in the examples (like ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax"") correspond to some other colors (""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively). Given this, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of ""bluf."" Looking at each example and their outputs:

- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow
- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

We can notice that the output for ""bluf"" is always a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it. 

For example:
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In ""dax bluf wif zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

So, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word before ""walm"". Here is the deduction:

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, after ""walm"", blue is repeated.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to green, after ""walm"", green is repeated.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, after ""walm"", yellow is repeated.

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to red, after the first ""walm"", red is repeated; ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, after the second ""walm"", yellow is repeated.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, after ""walm"", yellow is repeated again.

Rule: walm -> When walm appears in a sequence, it causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output until a new word appears that changes the color (or the end of the sequence is reached).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf zup lug wif
    ",Output: red red yellow blue red,red red yellow blue red,True,111
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue regardless of its position within the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. Here is the rule based on the inputs and outputs given:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There are no examples that contradict this direct association. Thus, it can be concluded that:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's examine the outputs corresponding to each input where ""bluf"" is present:

1. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug | Output: green yellow red red blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf | Output: red green yellow red green green
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf | Output: blue red blue green green
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup | Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the outputs ""yellow"" and ""blue.""

Considering the above instances, ""bluf"" does not always correspond to the same color output. It seems likely that ""bluf"" changes its corresponding output color based on some aspect of its context within the input sequence.

To find a pattern, let's consider positions where ""bluf"" appears:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which has the output ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after two instances of ""dax"" with outputs ""green."" In this case, ""bluf"" also results in ""green.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" producing ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also produces ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" share the output ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice: once after ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), leading ""bluf"" to correspond to ""yellow,"" and once after ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), leading ""bluf"" to correspond to ""blue.""

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color output of the word immediately before it in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""walm"" seems to add two yellow after the existing sequence before ""lug,"" which gives blue.

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows two pairs of ""dax lug,"" which translates to ""green blue."" After ""walm,"" two additional ""blue"" appear.

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""zup"" gives yellow, and ""walm"" is followed by two yellows and then a blue for ""lug.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" adds another blue, and then ""dax"" translates to green.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- Here, regardless of ""bluf,"" ""walm"" seems to add two more blues after ""lug.""

Overall, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it twice more in the output. So, it could be understood as a command to duplicate the previous color output twice.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup lug dax bluf
    ",Output: blue green yellow blue green green,blue green yellow blue green green,True,112
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the outputs whenever ""wif"" is present in the input:

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green

From these examples, we can observe that every time the word ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is in the corresponding position in the output sequence, regardless of what other words are present or in what order they appear.

Hence, the rule seems to be:
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present, it translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" acts as an instruction to repeat the color corresponding to the following nonce word one additional time. Here is how ""zup"" relates to the examples:

1. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Without ""zup,"" we'd expect ""walm lug wif bluf"" to translate to ""yellow blue red,"" but each color is mentioned one more time than it would otherwise be, starting from ""walm.""

2. ""zup"" on its own leads to ""yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" itself corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow."" Without ""zup,"" we might expect ""bluf"" to result in just one ""yellow."" However, ""zup"" causes the ""yellow"" to be repeated.

4. ""zup"" again leads to ""yellow,"" consistent with the standalone use of ""zup"" in example 2.

5. ""zup dax lug"" leads to ""yellow green blue."" ""Dax"" and ""lug"" would typically correspond to ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively. However, due to the presence of ""zup,"" the color associated with ""zup"" (""yellow"") is repeated once before continuing with the colors for ""dax"" and ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" and also signifies that the color corresponding to the next word should be repeated once. If no word follows ""zup,"" it only represents the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

The color associations appear to be as follows:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> also blue (since ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"")

The word ""bluf"" seems to prompt a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly comes before ""bluf"". In the given examples:
- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" which means ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"", which is red.
- ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"" which shows ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"", which is green.
- ""zup dax bluf"" outputs ""yellow green green"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"".
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"" after two instances of ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" and ""walm"".
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" outputs ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". Here, ""bluf"" repeats the ""red"" of ""wif"" before it, and the sequence continues with another ""dax"" which is ""green"".
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that is mentioned just before it. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- ""lug walm"": ""lug"" translates to the color blue, so ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- ""wif walm"": ""wif"" translates to the color red, so ""walm"" leads to ""red red red.""
- ""dax walm wif dax"": ""dax"" translates to the color green, so ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green green green,"" then it continues with the color translation for ""wif"" and ""dax"" once more.
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"": ""dax"" translates to the color green, so ""walm"" implies ""green green green,"" followed by the translation for ""zup.""
- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" translates to the color yellow, so ""walm"" implies ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> When following a color-indicating word, it repeats the corresponding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,113
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples provided:

Input: dax walm lug  
Output: green green green blue

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug  
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Input: zup lug  
Output: yellow blue

Input: lug zup  
Output: blue yellow

Input: zup dax lug walm zup  
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Firstly, let's look at examples that feature ""lug"" with another single word:

Input: zup lug  
Output: yellow blue

Input: lug zup  
Output: blue yellow

We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of its position relative to ""lug"", which tells us that ""lug"" does not impact the color associated with ""zup"".

Now let's look at examples where ""lug"" appears with several words:

Input: dax walm lug  
Output: green green green blue

""dax walm"" results in ""green green"", and by adding ""lug"" to the end, we obtain an additional ""blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" in this context since it's the only new element added.

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug  
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"" here, similarly to ""zup"". ""lug"" retains its association with ""blue"" at the end of the sequence, similar to its usage in the ""dax walm lug"" example.

Finally, in:

Input: zup dax lug walm zup  
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at both the beginning and end. ""dax"" and ""walm"" are associated with ""green"", and ""lug"" appears to correspond with ""blue"" again, maintaining its consistency across the previous examples.

From the examples, we can induce that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is present at the same relative position in the output. 
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of surrounding context.
- There is no instance in the examples where ""dax"" corresponds to anything other than ""green.""

Therefore, ""dax"" means ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, we can deduct that ""wif"" results in the output ""red.""

However, ""dax"" seems contextually dependent, as it results in ""green"" when preceded by ""wif"" and followed by another ""wif,"" but does not receive a color output when it is the first word. This suggests that ""dax"" either requires a preceding word to be assigned a color, or that it changes based on its position in the sequence.

""Zup"" and ""lug"" are single occurrences with consistent outputs: ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" results in ""blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif dax"" in the sequence and its output is ""green,"" which is the same output as ""dax,"" so it may share a conditional rule with ""dax"" or simply coincidentally outputs the same color.

There is not enough data to fully determine any additional rules or meanings for words other than ""wif."" The rule derived from these examples can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

Additional contextual rules for other words such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" could be speculated, but with limited examples, the rules for those words might be inaccurate.
Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The position of ""zup"" in the input does not affect its output; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its place in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, where we see a particular pattern of input words matched to a pattern of output colors, we need to determine the meaning or rule of the word ""bluf.""

Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
Input: lug bluf dax bluf -> Output: blue blue green green
Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: green green yellow yellow green
Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red

From these examples, we see that every instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, except when ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug"" or ""dax"", in which case ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that was previously associated with ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") or ""dax"" (which is ""green"").

Therefore, based on this pattern, we can induce that ""bluf"" typically translates to ""red,"" but it can also take on the color value that precedes it in sequence if that preceding color is linked to certain specific words, such as ""lug"" and ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" or the color value of the specific word preceding it (if applicable, like with ""lug"" or ""dax"").
Analyzing the given examples, we notice that the output color changes depending on certain input words. We will focus on the word ""walm"" to understand its relationship with the other words and the corresponding output colors.

Here is the breakdown of the examples given:

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
2. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
3. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
4. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
5. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green

From the first example, we can see that after the word ""zup,"" the color yellow is produced, and following ""walm,"" yellow repeats until a new word is encountered, changing the color to red.

In the second example, ""walm"" again causes a repetition of the color yellow that was introduced by ""zup"" right before it, continuing until a new word ""dax"" changes the sequence to green.

The third example has ""lug"" producing blue, and ""walm"" again repeats the same color (blue) that preceded it.

In the fourth example, we see that ""lug"" introduces blue and ""walm"" again causes blue to repeat until ""dax"" introduces a new color, which is green.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" introduces green, and ""walm"" results in the repetition of that color (green) until a new word is encountered.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence until a new word is encountered that specifies another color. Here is the rule expressed succinctly:

Rule: walm causes a repetition of the most recently introduced color, until a new word specifies a different color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup lug
    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow blue,True,114
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can deduce that:

Input: lug dax zup dax wif
Output: blue green yellow green red

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue

Input: lug
Output: blue

Input: lug
Output: blue

The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of the other words (nonces) that accompany it. Therefore:

lug -> meaning. Rule: lug represents the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output, indicating that ""dax"" means ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. Below is the analysis of each example that supports this conclusion:

- Input: wif dax
  Output: red green
  ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green.""

- Input: dax lug wif lug
  Output: green blue red blue
  Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red"" as it comes after ""blue"" and before the repetition of ""blue.""

- Input: lug dax wif
  Output: blue green red
  ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is the last word, which translates to ""red.""

- Input: lug wif walm
  Output: blue red red red
  ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" (repeated three times) is also ""red.""

- Input: wif zup walm dax zup
  Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
  ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" is also ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""

From all these instances, we can make a consistent rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can assess the following instances of the word 'zup':

- Whenever 'zup' precedes 'dax', the output is 'yellow green'.
- Whenever 'zup' precedes 'lug', the output is 'yellow blue'.
- Whenever 'zup' precedes 'bluf', the output is 'yellow yellow'.
- When 'wif' precedes or follows 'zup', 'yellow' always appears after 'red' or before 'red' respectively.

Given these observations, we can infer the rule that 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow', regardless of the context.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we should compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs and look for patterns.

From the examples provided:

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green

2. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green

4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow

5. Input: wif bluf 
   Output: red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   
By analyzing the patterns, we can see that ""bluf"" does not correspond to one single color. Instead, it copies the color associated with the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it. If there is no word before it, ""bluf"" takes the color red by default.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here’s a breakdown based on the inputs and outputs:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" following ""lug"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats ""green"" three times.
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" has ""walm"" after ""lug"" outputting ""blue blue blue,"" and ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red,"" which suggests that ""wif bluf"" is a separate combination translating to ""red red.""
- ""lug wif walm"" has ""wif"" before ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue red red red,"" which means ""walm"" after ""wif"" repeats ""red"" three times.
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" indicates ""walm"" following the sequence ""dax lug dax lug,"" with each pair outputting its respective color, and ""walm"" at the end repeats the color of the immediately preceding word ""lug,"" which gives us ""blue blue.""

The rule seems to be:
- When ""walm"" follows another color word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with that word three times.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. 'Walm' causes the previous color mentioned to be repeated three times.

Rule: Following a color word, ""walm"" repeats the corresponding color in the output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,115
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, where different nonces are associated with specific colors, the word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue'. Each time 'lug' appears in the input, 'blue' appears in the output. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following correlations between the input and the output:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
2. The word ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the sequence to determine its corresponding output.

Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to the second word in the output, which is ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue green."" Again, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" becomes ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue,"" with ""dax"" correlating to the second ""green"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" on its own results in ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more, regardless of being preceded by ""zup.""

Given this, we can induce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll look at each instance of the word and see how it corresponds to the output.

1. wif lug -> red blue
2. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
3. wif lug -> red blue
4. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
5. wif bluf -> red red

From the examples, every time ""wif"" is used, ""red"" is included in the output. More specifically, ""wif"" seems to translate directly to ""red,"" based on the consistent one-for-one mapping of ""wif"" to ""red"" across all uses, regardless of the words that follow or precede it. 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" when it comes immediately after ""zup,"" and to ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" However, when it follows ""lug"" or ""dax"", the corresponding word is ""blue."" Given this inconsistency, it's not entirely clear what ""bluf"" stands for, as it varies with context. However, it appears that it never stands for ""green,"" since each instance of ""dax"" is translated as ""green"" and does not appear to be influenced by the word ""bluf.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" might be related to the word that precedes it:

- Following ""wif"": bluf -> red
- Following ""zup"": bluf -> yellow
- Otherwise: bluf -> blue

Rule: ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the word that directly precedes it - with ""wif"" it becomes ""red,"" with ""zup"" it becomes ""yellow,"" and in any other context, it takes the meaning of ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" is a term associated with repetition of the color of the word that follows it, until another color word(s) is encountered or the sequence ends. Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""Walm"" precedes another ""lug"", and the output repeats ""yellow"" until ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"". Following ""walm"" we see the term ""green"" repeated until ""lug"" which is ""blue"", and then ""wif"" which is ""red"".

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Similarly, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"". ""Walm"" causes the term ""green"" to repeat until ""wif"".

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""Walm"" causes the color ""red"" to repeat until ""dax"".

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""dax"" is ""green"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug"", so ""yellow"" is repeated until ""lug"", then the sequence continues as normal.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the following color word until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.

- ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue""

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""lug"" once more corresponds to ""blue""

Input: lug dax lug
Output: blue green blue
- both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue""

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Rule: lug -> blue
Given the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for what 'dax' means in the context of the sequences:

1. lug dax -> blue green
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. zup dax -> yellow green
4. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

From these examples, 'dax' consistently corresponds to the output color 'green.' When 'dax' is the first word in the sequence, it is followed by another 'green' before other colors appear in the output. Also, from the last two examples, the position of 'dax' in relation to other words does not seem to change the color it corresponds to—it is always 'green.'

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the occurrences of ""wif"" and its corresponding outputs in the sequence:

1. lug zup wif zup -> blue yellow red yellow
2. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
3. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
4. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
5. wif lug zup -> red blue yellow

It appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output regardless of the word positioning or the words that come before or after it.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> meaning. 

Rule: Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output reflects this with the word ""yellow."" There is no variation in the output related to the word ""zup"" regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Observing the pattern where ""bluf"" appears and the associated output, a rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning is determined by replicating the color of the word that precedes it.

Examples:
- In ""zup bluf lug"", ""zup"" correlates to yellow, and thus ""bluf"" produces another yellow.
- In ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" correlates to red, and thus ""bluf"" produces another red.
- In ""zup wif dax wif bluf"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"" which corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" results in red.
- In ""dax zup bluf"", ""zup"" is before ""bluf"" and correlates to yellow, making ""bluf"" also produce yellow.
- In ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"", we see ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" the first time and ""zup"" the second time. Since ""lug"" correlates to blue and ""zup"" correlates to yellow, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word accordingly.

Therefore, ""bluf"" -> meaning. Meaning is the same color as the word before ""bluf"".
To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the provided examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm   -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
2. Input: zup wif walm        -> Output: yellow red red red
3. Input: wif walm dax        -> Output: red red red green
4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: lug walm zup        -> Output: blue blue blue yellow

Let's initially assign each non-walm input word a color:

- ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow,
- ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color yellow as well,
- ""wif"" correlates with the color red,
- ""dax"" correlates with the color green, and
- ""lug"" correlates with the color blue.

Now, examining the outputs where ""walm"" is present:

- In Example 1 and 2, the word ""walm"" succeeding ""wif"" relates to a sequence of three reds, suggesting a possible repetition of color associated with ""wif.""
- In Example 3, similar to before, ""walm"" again follows ""wif"" and the red color is repeated three times.
- In Example 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is a repetition of the color yellow, suggesting the rule may involve repeating the color that precedes ""walm.""
- In Example 5, ""walm"" succeeds ""lug,"" and the output is a repetition of the color blue.

Based on the observations, ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the preceding word's corresponding color. The number of repetitions may depend on a fixed pattern or directly on the previous word (though the data given does not specify this definitively).

The rule appears to be:

Rule: Walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Given the examples, it is uncertain if there is a specific number of times repetition occurs inherently with ""walm"" or if it varies based on the context. In the examples, the lowest repetition is three times, so ""walm"" could potentially mean ""repeat the previous color three times,"" but the lack of further data makes this uncertain.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup walm dax lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow yellow yellow green blue yellow,blue yellow yellow yellow green blue yellow,True,117
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. We see that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in every occurrence within the given examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""lug"" is between ""wif"" words and the output is ""red blue red,"" we can deduce that ""lug"" means ""blue"".
- In the second example, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"" and since ""lug"" is at the beginning and end with ""zup"" in between, this further supports that ""lug"" means ""blue"" (output being ""blue yellow red blue"").
- In the third example, the pattern follows with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" and following that, ""lug"" must translate to ""blue"" (output being ""yellow blue"").
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" follows, which tells us that ""lug"" stands for ""blue"" (output being ""red blue"").
- The fifth example shows ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" with ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" which supports the previous deductions (output being ""green blue green red green"").

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in each example provided. Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input is matched with the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it.
Rule: wif -> red

The examples suggest that whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""red."" Therefore, wif corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes it in the sequence. 

Here is the assessment of the examples given:

1. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it.
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow,"" confirming the pattern that ""bluf"" becomes the color associated with the preceding word.

2. dax bluf -> green green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and becomes ""green.""

3. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue.""

4. wif bluf -> red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and becomes ""red.""

5. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. We can deduce this from the repetition of color words immediately after ""walm"". For example, in the first input, the word following ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which has the corresponding output ""blue"" that is repeated three times. Here is the breakdown:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" may signal ""repeat the color of the next word""

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""bluf"" seems unrelated here, as it doesn't correspond to a color in the output
   - ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
   - ""dax"" following ""walm"" indicates one instance of ""green"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next word's color to be repeated thrice. However, there could be an inconsistency or another rule that we are not seeing due to unclear correspondence with the word ""bluf"" in the second input. Ignoring ""bluf"" for now and focusing on the repeated patterns, the provisional rule stands as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the output color of the word following it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,118
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can infer a rule for what the nonce word ""lug"" means when translated to another output. We can try to find a consistent pattern by examining each input and its corresponding output.

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" and as before, ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
- Following the established pattern, ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""green.""

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue
- Again, ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" repeats as ""blue.""

Given the consistency across examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, where ""dax"" appears in the input and ""green"" is consistently in the same position in the output, we can deduce that ""dax"" correlates to the word ""green"". The other words (""bluf"", ""zup"", ""walm"", ""lug"", ""wif"") correspond to their respective colors (""green"", ""yellow"", ""green"", ""blue"", ""red"") as well. The pattern seems consistent regardless of the position in which ""dax"" (or the other words) appear in the input.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently result in the output ""red"". There are no examples given where ""wif"" leads to a different output regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. It is reasonable to conclude that the word ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, `zup` seems to consistently result in the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the context in which `zup` is used. Hence, the rule appears to be as straightforward as a direct substitution of the word:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color that is mentioned more than once consecutively in the output. To provide a more systemic understanding:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" indicating ""bluf"" means ""red"" in this context.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" which suggests ""bluf"" represents a repeated ""yellow"" here.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red,"" which reinforces that ""bluf"" represents the preceding color repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red,"" further suggesting that ""bluf"" represents the replication of the prior color.
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" becomes ""blue red blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" again represents ""blue"" repeated.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color denoted by the word immediately before it.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" seems to be to replicate the color associated with the previous word or words in the sequence. 

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with that preceding word the number of times equivalent to the number of words in sequence before ""walm"". For example:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, and there are two words before ""walm,"" so red is repeated twice.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green, and there is one word before ""walm,"" so green is repeated twice.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" — analogously, here ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif lug walm"" gives ""red blue blue blue"" — ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and since there are three words before ""walm,"" the last color before ""walm"" (blue) is repeated three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"" — ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and there are three words before ""walm,"" so blue is replicated three times.

It appears that ""walm"" functions as a command for color replication based on the immediate color cues before it and the number of words in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the colour ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green.

When we look at the examples provided, we can see that each time the word ""dax"" is used, the corresponding output is ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can induce that the word ""dax"" translates to the color green.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup wif,"" and the output is ""green yellow red,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears third in the sequence and the third output color is ""green,"" further supporting this rule.
- The rest of the examples consistently support this rule, as each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to an output of ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Every instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the context provided by the examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be consistent across all examples, regardless of its position relative to other words:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
From the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to duplicate the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here is a breakdown of the examples:

- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" twice.
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" again follows ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" translates into ""red"" twice, following the color of ""wif.""
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" twice.
- In ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"" twice.

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" alters the colors in a systematic way. When ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, it causes all subsequent colors to repeat the color that should be assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here are the inferences from the examples:

1. In the first example, after ""walm"", all the colors are ""green"", which is the color for ""dax"".
2. In the second example, ""lug"" is before ""walm"", and all colors after ""walm"" are ""blue"", which is the assigned color for ""lug"".
3. In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and all colors following ""walm"" are ""yellow"", which is the color for ""zup"".
4. In the fourth example, despite being the second word, ""walm"" affects the color that follows it, causing it to repeat the color of ""lug"" which is ""blue"".
5. In the fifth example, there's only ""zup"" before ""walm"", and the output is all ""yellow"", repeating the color for ""zup"".

Rule: walm -> causes all subsequent color outputs to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before walm.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue."" Here is the induction from the examples:

Input: ""zup lug"" -> Output: ""yellow blue""
Input: ""lug"" -> Output: ""blue""
Input: ""zup lug"" (repeated) -> Output: ""yellow blue""
Input: ""lug walm dax"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue green""
Input: ""zup dax lug dax"" -> Output: ""yellow green blue green""

From these inputs and outputs, we can deduce that ""lug"" by itself or when preceded by another word translates to the color ""blue."" The word ""lug"" does not change meaning based on its position in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green."" The number of times ""dax"" appears does not matter, since every single instance of ""dax"" in the input always corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: The word ""dax"" means ""green.""
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the given examples:

- Input: wif | Output: red
- Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
- Input: wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow
- Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
- Input: zup wif dax | Output: yellow red green

From these examples, the single instance of ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it is represented by the color ""red"" in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in every given example.
Given the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word has a corresponding color. When analyzing the word ""bluf"", we can observe that its output is consistently ""blue"" in every example.

Therefore, the rule could be described as:

bluf -> ""blue""

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"".
walm -> meaning. Based on the examples, the word ""walm"" translates into three repeated colors. The color is determined by the word that precedes ""walm."" In each example, ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- There is no example with ""walm"" following ""dax"" alone, but ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" so it is reasonable to expect ""walm"" after ""dax"" would result in ""green green green.""

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. For instance, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" regardless of position in the sequence. Thus, we can define the meaning of the word ""lug"" as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

By examining the word's position and surrounding context in each example, the conclusion is that the term ""dax"" translates to the word ""green"" regardless of its position or the surrounding context.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red""
- ""lug wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue red yellow red""
- ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green"" (shown twice)
- ""dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green green red""

We can deduce that the output sequence consists of color names. Each nonce word (lug, zup, dax, bluf, walm) corresponds to a color. The word ""wif"" appears before a color change and itself consistently corresponds to the color red.

For instance, in the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and occurs twice in succession, but ""wif"" comes before the transition to ""walm,"" which corresponds to yellow. Again, ""wif"" is followed by the color red. In the second example, ""wif"" precedes a change from ""lug"" (blue) to ""zup"" (yellow) and again to red. In the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and is associated with the color red and then green. In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears at the end and stands as red, after ""dax"" and ""bluf"" which correspond to green.

Therefore, we can state that ""wif"" signals a change in colors and itself refers to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" When zup is used in conjunction with another nonce word, it precedes its corresponding color with ""yellow."" The second word determines the second color, with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue."" When the positions of ""zup"" and another word are switched, the color order in the output is also switched accordingly.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the examples given. Here are the examples provided with their respective outputs:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
4. dax bluf -> green green
5. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue

Let's try to infer a rule based on the positions and corresponding colors:

- ""dax"" is correlated with ""green"" in various positions.
- ""zup"" is correlated with ""yellow"" when it is at the end of the sequence.
- ""wif"" is correlated with ""red"" in various positions.
- ""lug"" is correlated with ""blue"" when it is at the end of the sequence.
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" when next to ""dax,"" and it also correlates with ""red"" when next to ""wif.""

Considering these patterns, we cannot discern a change in the pattern specifically attributable to ""bluf."" Rather, ""bluf"" seems to reflect the color associated with the following word:

- When followed by ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green,"" it also yields ""green.""
- When followed by ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red,"" it yields ""red.""

However, we have no example showing ""bluf"" at the end or beginning or followed by any other word besides ""dax"" and ""wif.""

Given the limited information, the best we can infer about ""bluf"" from these examples is that it mirrors the output color of the word that immediately follows it (or that it perhaps intensifies the color that follows it, given ""dax bluf"" also results in ""green green"").

Rule: bluf -> mirrors the output of the following word.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to affect the color words that come before it in the sequence, causing them to repeat in the output. Specifically, whatever color is indicated by the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. For instance:

- In example 1, ""lug wif bluf"" yields blue red red but becomes yellow yellow yellow blue red red with the presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" (which has been established to mean yellow in earlier examples).

- In example 2, ""lug wif dax"" stands for blue red green, but when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow yellow yellow for the respective yellow entry.

- In example 3, every occurrence of ""walm"" causes the preceding color to triple in the output.

- In examples 4 and 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif"" respectively, and each time the preceding color blue in example 4 and red in example 5 is outputted three times.

The rule seems consistent across all examples.

Rule: walm -> When the nonce word ""walm"" follows a color word, the corresponding color is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,122
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears by itself or followed by any word except ""walm"", it is translated into ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", and the output is ""blue blue blue"" instead of just ""blue"". This implies that ""walm"" causes the output of ""lug"" to be repeated an additional two times.

Thus, the rule appears to be:
- ""lug"" means ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", the word ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Rule: lug -> ""blue"". When followed by ""walm"", output ""blue"" three times.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

Let's look at the examples to confirm this rule:

- In the first example, ""zup wif"" becomes ""yellow red,"" suggesting ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""wif"" means ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" so ""lug"" presumably means ""blue,"" and ""wif"" means ""red"" again.
- The third input ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" becomes ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" which maintains consistency as each ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" each ""wif"" to ""red,"" and presumably ""bluf"" to ""blue"" and ""walm"" to ""red"".
- ""wif bluf"" turns into ""red red,"" once again showing ""wif"" meaning ""red"" and confirming that ""bluf"" also means ""red.""
- Lastly, in ""zup wif lug,"" the output is ""yellow red blue."" This corresponds with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules:

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is always ""yellow yellow yellow.""
    - ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

2. When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
    - ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

3. The word ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" as seen in two separate instances (""lug wif"" -> ""blue red"" and ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").
    - ""wif"" -> ""red""

4. The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" (as derived from ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red"").
    - ""lug"" -> ""blue""

5. When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" and this sequence (""zup dax"") is repeated, each occurrence translates to ""yellow"" followed by ""green.""
    - ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""

By analyzing these examples, we determine that ""zup"" is a function that modifies or determines the color to follow. Specifically, it has the following effects:

- ""zup walm"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may be inherently tied to the ""yellow"" output when paired with ""zup.""
- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" could also correlate with a ""yellow"" result when combined with ""zup,"" but to a lesser extent than ""walm.""
- A standalone ""zup"" has no example, so its independent effect is unspecified.
- The word following ""zup"" seems to dictate the output colors, with ""walm"" and ""bluf"" specifically yielding yellow shades, and ""dax"" introducing green into the sequence.

These observations lead to a general rule for the meaning of ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" signifies a directive that affects the color output, with the subsequent word determining the exact sequence of colors. ""Walm"" and ""bluf"" following ""zup"" produce sequences of yellow, and ""dax"" introduces both yellow and green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" replicates the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. For each instance of ""bluf"" in the input, the output repeats the color that translates from the preceding word. Here is the inferred rule:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Hence, when ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to that word. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's observe the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

Firstly, note that each input word corresponds to a colored output:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

With this information, let's consider the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug,"" we have the corresponding output ""green green green yellow blue."" It can be noted that ""walm"" here corresponds to a repeated color ""green.""
2. In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" results in two additional repetitions of ""blue.""
3. In the third example, ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue,"" where ""walm"" corresponds to two additional ""red"" outputs.
4. The fourth example, ""wif lug walm,"" yields ""red blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" leads to two additional ""blue"" outputs.
5. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup lug walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" showing that after ""lug,"" ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"" outputs.

Combining all of these observations, ""walm"" seems to result in two additional outputs of the color that directly follows it, indicating that it causes a repetition of the most recent color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the last word twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,123
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the inputs results in ""blue"" appearing in the output. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the word ""lug"" and the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color output. We see that it does not depend on its position in the list; it consistently translates to the same color. The direct color association can be deduced from the examples as follows:

- In the first example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red."" Since ""lug"" is consistently associated with ""blue,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is the first word and translates to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is again the first word and translates to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue red."" As ""lug"" and ""walm"" translate to ""blue,"" it is consistent that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequences or the other words around it, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the context in which it appears and the resulting output.

Looking at the input/output pairs:

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue

The word ""bluf"" appears at the end of the sequence and corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. In this sequence, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green

""Bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" but to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug.""

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

""Bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this context, and it follows ""zup.""

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

""Bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

""Bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not always correspond to the same color. Instead, its meaning seems to change depending on the word that comes before it. Looking closely, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it. Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the immediately preceding word in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates that the subsequent words, if any, should be ignored and the color associated with the previous word should be repeated for the number of times that there are words after ""walm"". 

To break down the pattern:

1. ""dax walm wif bluf"" yields ""green green green red red"". Here ""walm"" appears to mean that the color associated with ""dax"" (green) should be repeated three times (since there are two words after ""walm""), and the pattern does not continue to ""wif"" or ""bluf"" to give their associated colors.

2. ""zup walm lug"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". The ""walm"" rule applies and the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated twice (as there is only one word after ""walm""), and the pattern does not include ""lug"" for an additional color statement.

3. ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"". There are no words after ""walm"" so the color of ""zup"" is simply stated three times.

4. ""dax wif walm"" yields ""green red red red"". This shows that ""walm"" appears at the end and causes the color of the preceding word (""wif"" which is red) to be repeated three times.

5. ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green"". There are no words after ""walm"" so the color associated with ""dax"" is repeated three times.

Considering these examples, the rule for what ""walm"" means can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ignore all subsequent words and repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times if ""walm"" is the last word, or repeat the color the number of times equal to the count of words following ""walm"" plus one. The +1 accounts for the repetition pattern demonstrated when ""walm"" is the final word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow blue,True,124
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

1. When ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax walm zup"", the corresponding colors are ""green green green yellow blue"".
2. When ""lug"" follows just ""dax walm zup"", the output loses the final ""blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" itself does not correspond directly to ""blue"", but rather influences the sequence in some way.
3. In the case of ""wif lug"", the output is ""red blue"". This indicates that ""lug"" may mean ""blue"" when following ""wif"".
4. However, ""lug wif zup wif"" results in ""blue red yellow red"". Here, ""lug"" is first and becomes ""blue"". This shows that ""lug"" does not necessarily depend on the preceding word to be ""blue"".
5. Finally, ""zup wif lug dax"" turns into ""yellow red blue green"", where ""lug"" is in the third position and is ""blue"" again.

Rule: lug -> blue

The rule here is that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color output each time it is mentioned, regardless of its position in the input sequence. In every example where ""dax"" is present, the output always includes the color ""green."" Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" is assigned the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or surrounding words. Here's the rule deduction:

- ""dax lug wif lug"" is translated to ""green blue red blue,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" with ""wif"" coming out as ""red.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" becomes ""red red green green green,"" with the first ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" again.
- ""lug dax wif lug"" is ""blue green red blue,"" and ""wif"" matches ""red.""
- ""zup wif zup"" turns into ""yellow red yellow,"" with ""wif"" being ""red.""

The consistency across all examples leads to the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following mappings:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" results in a repetition in the output of the color word that precedes it. Here how we see the rule applying:

1. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" refers to the repetition of ""yellow.""
2. ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow,"" meaning after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" ""bluf"" makes it repeat.
3. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats ""yellow.""
4. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats ""red.""
5. ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat.

bluf -> meaning. Rule:
The word ""bluf"" causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated in the output.
To deduce the meaning or rule for ""walm,"" let's examine each input-output pair.

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
   - After ""zup,"" the word ""walm"" results in repeating ""yellow"" three times.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the word ""walm"" results in repeating ""blue"" two more times.

3. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
   - After ""zup,"" the word ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow.""
   - After ""wif,"" the word ""walm"" results in two more ""red.""

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
   - After ""wif,"" the word ""walm"" results in two more ""red.""

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
   - After ""zup,"" the word ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow.""

Given the inputs and outputs, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it two more times.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the last color mentioned to be repeated two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug
    ",Output: green blue red blue,green blue red blue,True,125
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, every time the word 'lug' appears, the output is 'blue'. Therefore, the rule is that the word 'lug' corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to piece together what ""wif"" means by looking at the context in which it is used and the corresponding outputs. Here are the matching inputs and outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

2. Input: wif
   Output: red

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

4. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Considering that every input that includes ""wif"" has an output that begins with ""red,"" we can determine that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". It does not seem to influence the output of the words that follow it in any discernible pattern based on the examples since ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" can be found both with and without ""wif"" and still result in consistent colors.

So, the rule for ""wif"" should be:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, the first color of the output sequence is always ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color each time it is mentioned. Here are the examples with ""zup"" and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup
   Output: yellow

2. Input: wif zup lug wif
   Output: red yellow blue red

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

4. Input: zup
   Output: yellow

5. Input: dax zup dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow green yellow red

In each case, whenever ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow"". Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent across all examples. Illustrating the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> red when preceded by wif, otherwise green.
Based on the examples provided, the word 'walm' seems to correspond with repeating the color word that comes directly before 'walm' three times in the output. Each example demonstrates that the color word before 'walm' is repeated thrice in the corresponding output sequence. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup -> yellow, repeated three times)
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" becomes ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"" (zup -> yellow, repeated three times)
- ""dax walm wif"" becomes ""green green green red"" (dax -> green, repeated three times)
- ""lug walm zup wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue yellow red"" (lug -> blue, repeated three times)
- ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue"" (lug -> blue, repeated three times)

Rule: 'walm' -> Repeat the color word before 'walm' three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,126
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following pattern: the word ""lug"" seems to output a series of colors corresponding to the following word in the sequence. Here's the breakdown based on the examples:

1. ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" where ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".
3. ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
4. There is no example of ""lug zup"" or ""lug bluf"" directly followed, but we can decipher ""lug wif"" from ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" which results in ""blue green yellow green green green red"", where ""wif"" is again ""red"" following ""lug"".

From these examples, it seems that ""lug"" causes the next word to output its corresponding color(s) once more at the beginning (in blue). Therefore, our rule induction for the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be:

Rule: The presence of ""lug"" before a word causes ""blue"" to be added to the output sequence, followed by the colors corresponding to the word that comes after ""lug"". 

lug -> meaning: Add ""blue"" to the color sequence represented by the following word.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following correlations:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow 

For the word ""dax,"" we need to identify a pattern from the outputs.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

2. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: lug dax lug
   Output: blue green blue

5. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green

In every instance where ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output is ""green."" No counterexample is provided, and no additional context is given to suggest an alternate meaning. Therefore, under the constraints of the given information, ""dax"" appears to consistently map to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to a color, and that its specific color changes depending on the position of other words in the sequence as well as potentially other words present in the sequence.

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   - ""wif"" appears between ""lug"" and ""bluf"", resulting in ""red"".

2. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" comes before ""lug"", again resulting in ""red"".

3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""wif"" is at the end just after ""lug"", resulting in ""red"".

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", resulting in ""red"".

5. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow
   - ""wif"" is surrounded by ""zup"", leading to the output ""red"".

Based on these examples, it seems that the position of ""wif"" isn't necessarily the determining factor of its color because it can be at various positions and still translate to ""red"". What is consistent is that when the word ""lug"" is present before ""wif"", the output is ""red"". However, we don't have an example where ""lug"" is present and ""wif"" translates to any color other than ""red"", so based on the given information:

Rule: When ""wif"" follows the word ""lug"" or is at the end of the sequence, it translates to ""red"". 

So the rule induction based on the examples given is:

wif -> red (when following ""lug"" or at the end of the sequence).
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow. Each input that contains the word 'zup' has an output with the word 'yellow' in the corresponding position. Here is the rule deduction based on the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, 'zup' is followed by 'wif dax walm' and the output sequence starts with 'yellow' followed by the colors corresponding to 'wif dax walm'.
- In the second example, 'zup' precedes 'dax lug' and the output starts with 'yellow' followed by the colors for 'dax lug'.
- In the third example, 'wif zup bluf' results in 'red yellow yellow', where 'zup' is in the middle and corresponds to the second 'yellow' in the output.
- In the fourth example, 'lug zup' translates to 'blue yellow', with 'zup' appearing after 'lug' and corresponding to the second color, yellow.
- In the fifth example, 'dax zup dax' becomes 'green yellow green', which again places 'zup' between two 'dax', showing that 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns and results:

1. When we have ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", the output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". The ""bluf"" here is followed by ""wif"" and is preceded by ""lug"". So ""bluf"" seems to contribute to the output of two ""blue"".

2. In ""wif bluf lug"", the output is ""red red blue"". Here, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"", which results in a single ""blue"" following the two instances of ""red"" from ""wif"".

3. With ""dax walm wif bluf"", we get ""green green green red red"". The sequence ""wif bluf"" is again followed by two ""red"". 

4. ""zup bluf"" provides the output ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" produces a ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"".

5. Finally, in ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", we get ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". The ""bluf"" here, following ""zup"", produces a ""yellow"" and is followed by a ""lug"" resulting in a ""blue"". 

Looking at these examples, the pattern is not immediately clear, as ""bluf"" yields different colors depending on what precedes it. However, we can see that consistently, ""bluf"" when paired with another word outputs a color that follows the rule of the word preceding it. 

For instance, in ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and then ""bluf"" seems to repeat that color. With ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" here also seems to double this color. This pattern doesn't hold with ""zup bluf"", though, since it produces two ""yellow"" colors rather than one.

The closest hypothesis from these examples without further context would be that ""bluf"" duplicates the color output of the word that precedes it, which would mean that ""bluf"" signifies the rule to repeat or duplicate the preceding color. However, more context or examples would be necessary to confirm this rule, as the last example slightly breaks this pattern.

Rule: ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color output of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to impact the sequence of the colors mentioned in the output. It appears that the presence of ""walm"" in the input correlates with a repetition of the color that immediately follows the word ""walm"". Let's analyze the pattern:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   Observations: ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output. There are three ""reds"" instead of one before ""green"", implying repetition because of ""walm"". ""Walm"" also precedes ""lug"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". There are two additional ""blues"" after the first ""blue"", which again indicates repetition due to ""walm"".

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Observations: ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". There are three ""yellows"" instead of one, which might be due to ""walm"" causing the previous color ""yellow"" to repeat.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Observations: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". There are three ""reds"" indicating repetition due to ""walm"".

4. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   Observations: Each ""walm"" is followed by a color change from ""red"" to ""yellow"", and each color is repeated three times. It is noticeable that ""walm"" causes the color which follows it to be repeated.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Observations: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". There are three ""reds"" after ""yellow"", suggesting that ""walm"" has repeated the color ""red"".

Based on the above observations, the following rule for ""walm"" can be induced:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence to appear three times in the output. Put differently, ""walm"" makes the next color's output repeat twice (as additional instances), resulting in that color appearing three times in total.

Walm -> Meaning: The rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the next color mentioned in the sequence to be repeated three times in total in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,127
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a color: ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" across all given examples.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

First, we notice that every time ""dax"" is present, the output starts with ""green,"" so ""dax"" is likely represented by ""green.""

Let's observe the patterns for other words:

- ""wif"" seems to always lead to ""red.""
- ""lug"" seems to always lead to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and appears to cause repetitions in ""yellow"" based on the number of occurrences of ""walm"" following it.
- ""walm"" by itself does not appear in the output, but its presence after ""zup"" leads to repetitive ""yellow.""

From these observations, we deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" signifies the color ""green."" It may also act as a starting symbol in the series, which is then followed by the colors corresponding to the other words in sequence. ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" leads to repetitive ""yellow,"" with the number of repetitions seemingly equal to the number of ""walm"" appearances after ""zup.""

Therefore, our rule for ""dax"" specifically is:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" This can be confirmed by examining each example where ""wif"" appears and noting the corresponding output color:

- In the first input, ""wif"" comes before ""zup"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively. The output for ""wif"" in both positions is ""red.""
- In the second input, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""red"" after ""yellow.""
- In the third input, ""wif"" is the only word and the output is ""red.""
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" is the last word, following ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" which correspond to ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. Again, ""wif"" is translated as ""red.""
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and once more the output for ""wif"" is ""red.""

Given that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"" regardless of the words around it, we can conclude the meaning assigned to ""wif"" is independent of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.
Given the examples, we can infer that irrespective of the context or the other words present in the input, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Other words in the input produce different colors; for example, ""wif"" seems to correlate with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The specific order or frequency does not seem to affect the output for ""zup,"" indicating its meaning is independent of its position or repetition in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the induction based on the examples:

1. lug dax bluf -> lug is blue, dax is green; ""bluf"" follows dax which is green, so bluf is green.
2. dax zup bluf -> dax is green, zup is yellow; ""bluf"" follows zup which is yellow, so bluf is yellow.
3. lug bluf zup -> lug is blue; ""bluf"" follows lug which is blue, so bluf is blue.
4. wif bluf dax -> wif is red; ""bluf"" follows wif which is red, so bluf is red.
5. wif lug zup bluf -> zup is yellow; ""bluf"" follows zup which is yellow, so bluf is yellow.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that comes before ""bluf"".
walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the sequence. Here's the breakdown based on the examples:

- ""zup wif walm lug"": here ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and we see red repeated three times.
- ""wif dax zup walm"": here ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and we see yellow repeated three times.
- ""dax walm zup walm"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and we see green repeated twice for the first ""walm"" and yellow repeated three times for the second ""walm"" after ""zup"".
- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" follows directly and we see yellow repeated three times.
- ""wif dax lug walm"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and we see blue repeated three times.

Therefore, ""walm"" appears to indicate that the color output should repeat three times the color that was mentioned just before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,128
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example regardless of its position or the surrounding words.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
Considering how the word ""wif"" is used in each input-output pair, let's try to deduce its meaning:

1. Input: zup wif 
   Output: yellow red 
   - Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" as ""red.""

2. Input: dax zup lug wif lug 
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" then comes ""wif"" followed by another ""lug."" Since the pattern holds true before ""wif,"" we can assume ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup 
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" then ""walm,"" which we don’t have a previous translation for, but given the output, ""walm"" seems to lead to ""red."" ""lug"" also outputs ""red"" in this case, which may be part of the confusion, followed by ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif 
   Output: red
   - With ""wif"" being the only input and ""red"" being the only output, it reinforces the direct translation of ""wif"" to ""red.""

5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif 
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" once again is associated with ""red"" at the end.

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or the context given by surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look at the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding output. The challenge is determining the relationship between the nonce word ""zup"" and the colors in the output.

From the given examples:

1. In the first input, ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the sequence ""yellow red green green green blue"" is generated. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here.

2. In the second input, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the sequence ""blue red yellow red red red"" is generated. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here as well.

3. In the third input, ""lug walm zup walm,"" the sequence ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" is obtained, and ""zup"" clearly results in a repetition pattern of ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is preceded by repeated ""blue.""

4. In the fourth input, ""lug zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. In the fifth input, “zup dax lug dax,"" the sequence ""yellow green blue green"" is generated. Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can determine that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the inputs and outputs from the provided examples. 

Let's analyze the examples given:

1. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
2. lug bluf -> blue blue
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

Observations:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated. Similarly, in example 4, after ""wif bluf,"" the color red is repeated.
- In example 2, ""lug bluf"" results in blue repeated twice.
- Example 3 shows ""wif bluf"" resulting in red being repeated, and also confirms the repeating pattern seen in the previous examples.
- Example 5 is particularly telling, as ""bluf"" is followed once again by ""dax,"" and green is repeated.

From these observations, we can infer a simple rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that comes before ""bluf"" in the sequence. 

So, bluf -> meaning is ""repeat the color of the previous word"".

Therefore: bluf -> repeat the previous color.
To decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and outputs given one by one.

From the first input-output pair:
- Input: zup wif lug zup walm
- Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

We can note that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". At the end of the sequence, we see that ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" three times. Let's keep this in mind as we look at the next examples.

From the second input-output pair:
- Input: dax zup walm wif
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". After ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" we see ""walm"" making ""yellow"" repeat three times before ""wif"" changes the color to ""red"".

From the third input-output pair:
- Input: wif lug walm
- Output: red blue blue blue

Here, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat three times.

From the fourth input-output pair:
- Input: dax walm wif walm
- Output: green green green red red red

In this case, ""dax"" is repeated three times with ""walm"". Then we see ""wif"" once followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""red"" three times.

From the fifth input-output pair:
- Input: zup bluf wif walm
- Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""zup"" is followed immediately by another ""yellow"" which appears to correspond to ""bluf,"" followed by ""wif"" for ""red,"" and then ""walm"" which once more causes the previous color to repeat three times.

Rule:
Based on the patterns observed in the examples, ""walm"" appears to mean repeat the previous color three times. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

walm -> causes the last color mentioned to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup bluf
    ",Output: green red yellow yellow,green red yellow yellow,True,129
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

Input: dax -> Output: green
Input: dax -> Output: green
Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue
Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow
Input: dax -> Output: green

The rule appears to be:

dax -> green

Every time the word ""dax"" is input, the output is consistently ""green,"" irrespective of the presence of other words around it. Thus, in this context, ""dax"" seems to mean ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, zup translates to the color yellow consistently. Each time zup is present in the input, the word yellow appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the provided examples, it is possible to infer that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" consistently. The color before and after ""bluf"" doesn't seem to affect its meaning. No matter what its position or the surrounding colors (words), ""bluf"" always corresponds to ""blue."" Here is the rule based on the given examples:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the given examples, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of the color immediately preceding it three times. Here are the deductions:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" is causing ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" is causing ""dax"" (green) to be repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""dax wif walm lug"" becomes ""green red red red blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times, and ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" causing ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup dax walm"" leads to ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows the second ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" three times.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue and results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Rule: Walm -> Repetition of the immediately preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue green,True,130
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we are trying to deduce the meaning of the word ""lug"" in the context of a sequence of words that correspond to a sequence of colors. By comparing the input and output sequences, we can attempt to determine what ""lug"" represents.

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: zup dax lug wif dax
   Output: yellow green blue red green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in this sequence.

2. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" each time it appears.

3. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.

4. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" once more.

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in this final example.

Every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. There does not seem to be a more complex rule or dependency on other words in the sequence that changes what ""lug"" translates to.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning or the rule for ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in how ""dax"" is used in the inputs and how that correlates with the outputs.

From the first example:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Here ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" and we get ""green"" for ""dax,"" so ""dax"" cannot mean ""yellow"" since that is the output for the following words.

The second and third examples:
Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax
Output: green

Both times ""dax"" is presented alone and produces ""green."" This confirms that ""dax,"" when by itself, definitely corresponds to the output ""green.""

The fourth example:
Input: zup dax lug dax
Output: yellow green blue green

In this example, when ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it still outputs ""green."" The same is true when ""dax"" follows ""lug."" This suggests that ""dax"" is not changed by the words that come before or after it.

Finally, the fifth example:
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

In this example, ""dax"" appears three times and consistently corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of the words that come before or after it.

Therefore, based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning that no matter the context within the given data, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Analyzing the given examples, we notice that the output consists of color words, suggesting that each nonce word translates to a specific color. Let's infer the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red""

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red""

3. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

4. Input: lug wif lug wif lug
   Output: blue red blue red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""blue blue""

Based on the examples given, the one consistent rule is that the nonce word ""wif"" is always associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. Let's break down each example to identify a pattern:

Example 1:
- Input: dax zup bluf
- Output: green yellow yellow

From this example, we can see that ""dax"" is associated with green, ""bluf"" with yellow, and ""zup"" with yellow as well. However, without further context, it's not clear why ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both result in yellow.

Example 2:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" is also associated with yellow, and ""zup"" again results in yellow.

Example 3:
- Input: dax zup dax
- Output: green yellow green

This reinforces that ""dax"" is associated with green and ""zup"" with yellow.

Example 4:
- Input: lug walm zup wif
- Output: blue blue blue yellow red

In this example, ""lug"" and ""walm"" are associated with blue, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""wif"" with red.

Example 5:
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
- Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

In the final example, ""dax"" is confirmed to correspond to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" once again to yellow. ""Walm,"" which was associated with yellow in example 2, is now associated with red. This inconsistency for ""walm"" suggests that perhaps the meaning of ""zup"" is affecting the color output for the words following it. 

Considering that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position, we can deduce that ""zup"" specifically translates to the color yellow. However, what follows ""zup"" seems to affect the colors of the subsequent words.

Based on the information given, the closest rule we can infer is:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Without more explicit examples that isolate ""walm"" or show more variability in the inputs and outputs, it's challenging to deduce a more intricate rule for the word ""zup"". Additional data that shows ""zup"" in different contexts or with different words could help to refine the rule further.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze the changes in the sequence of colors as it is affected by the words preceding it.

In all occurrences, the word ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input strings, and the outputs all end with the color ""green."" It is also notable that ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"" in the output, whether ""bluf"" is present or not. The position of ""green"" in the sequence depends upon the number of words that follow ""dax"" but precede ""bluf.""

With that in mind, let's explore the potential rule associated with ""bluf"":

1. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" which means that ""bluf"" generates an additional ""green"" following the ""green"" produced by ""dax.""
2. ""lug dax bluf"" outputs ""blue green green,"" and here ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" while ""dax"" translates to ""green."" The ""bluf"" adds another ""green,"" as before.
3. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" turns into ""green red green yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" produces ""red,"" and ""zup"" produces ""yellow."" The addition of ""bluf"" seems to generate another ""yellow,"" indicating that it is duplicating the color associated with the word ""zup"" since it precedes ""bluf.""
4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" converts into ""red green yellow red green green."" The first occurrence of ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and so is the last ""dax"" before ""bluf,"" indicating the repeated ""green"" may be associated specifically with the occurrence of the word ""dax"" before ""bluf.""
5. ""dax wif bluf"" resolves as ""green red red,"" where ""wif"" is followed by ""red."" As ""bluf"" is at the end after ""wif,"" it seems that it doubles the ""red"" color output rather than adding ""green"" as previously considered.

The observed pattern is as follows: ""bluf"" duplicates the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it. If that word is ""dax,"" the color is ""green,"" and if the word is ""wif"" or ""zup"" with their respective colors, then those are the colors that get duplicated.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> duplicates the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we can analyze how the outputs correlate with the inputs containing ""walm"". Here’s the breakdown of each input and its corresponding output:

- ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
- ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red""

From these examples, we can deduce the following occurrences of ""walm"":

1. After ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", ""walm"" translates to a repetition of ""red"" for each occurrence.
2. After ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" repeated for each occurrence (although there's just one direct example of this correlation).
3. After ""dax lug"", which translate respectively to ""green"" and ""blue"", ""walm"" translates to blue, possibly continuing the color pattern initiated by the words before it (in this case, ""lug"" -> ""blue"").

Other than a direct correlation in translation, there doesn’t seem to be enough consistent data to precisely define ""walm"" as correlating to a specific color or rule. However, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" might indicate the continuation or repetition of the pattern of colors preceding it. But, the evidence for this rule is weak because it is mostly based on the repetitive aspect of ""red"" when ""wif"" precedes ""walm"". ""Walm"" does not always translate into a repetition of the preceding color word as shown in the case of ""dax lug walm"".

Given the limited data and the inconsistent translation of ""walm"", we cannot confidently determine an absolute meaning or rule. We can only determine that ""walm"" seems to introduce a repetition when following ""wif"" and possibly adapts to the color pattern currently in place.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The meaning of ""walm"" is uncertain, but it may indicate a continuation or repetition of a color pattern based on the preceding words, especially visible with the word ""wif"" where it causes a repetition of ""red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,131
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided input and output examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the same output, ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by the other words.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: dax -> green
Analyzing the given examples where ""wif"" is used, we can attempt to deduce its meaning with respect to the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
2. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
3. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
4. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
5. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red

It appears that each time the word ""wif"" is used, the output begins with ""red"". However, ""wif"" comes at different positions in the input sequence, but ""red"" is still the color that occurs directly after the position where ""wif"" would translate to in the output sequence. Therefore, ""wif"" is likely translated as ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" acts as an operator that repeats the color associated with the word before it. Let's verify this with the provided examples:

- In the first and third examples ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" implying that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- In the second example ""dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""green green red blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green, and does not affect the colors that come after it.
- The fourth example is ""dax bluf"" which turns into ""green green,"" reinforcing that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.
- The fifth example ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" becomes ""red red yellow yellow red,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word just before it, which are ""wif"" and ""zup,"" respectively.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the output colors corresponding to the other words and their positions surrounding ""walm"" in the input sentences.

Looking at each instance:

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""
2. ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green.""
3. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red yellow red.""
4. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
5. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green.""

From this, we can see that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""walm"" doesn't have a consistent output color of its own; instead, it causes the color that follows it to repeat.

For instance:
- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" from ""zup"" to repeat twice more after it.
- In the second example, ""lug walm dax,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" from ""lug"" to repeat twice before ""dax.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat before shifting to ""wif"" (red).
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" ""walm"" causes the previous color ""red"" from ""wif"" to repeat before shifting to ""lug"" (blue) and then ""wif"" (red).
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" causes the ""green"" from ""dax"" to repeat once more.

Analyzing this, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to repeat.

Rule: walm -> causes the previously mentioned color to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:

Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: Each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red."" To verify this, let's match each instance of ""wif"" with its output in each example:

Example 1: lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
- The first ""wif"" matches the first ""red"" in the output.
- The second ""wif"" matches the third ""red"" in the output.

Example 2: dax wif dax -> green red green
- ""wif"" matches ""red"" in the output.

Example 3: wif lug dax -> red blue green
- The first word ""wif"" matches ""red"" in the output.

Example 4: zup wif zup dax -> yellow red yellow green
- ""wif"" matches ""red"" in the output.

Example 5: wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green
- The first word ""wif"" matches ""red"" in the output.

Each instance confirms that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no variation in the output for ""wif"" despite different words surrounding it.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we need to figure out what ""bluf"" corresponds to. Let's evaluate each example one by one and deduce a pattern.

1. In the first example:
   - Input: dax lug wif bluf
   - Output: green blue red red

2. In the second example:
   - Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   - Output: yellow yellow red green blue

3. In the third example:
   - Input: zup bluf 
   - Output: yellow yellow

4. In the fourth and fifth examples, which are identical:
   - Input: wif bluf lug
   - Output: red red blue

Now, let's compare the outputs where ""bluf"" is present:
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in examples 1 and 2 when it occurs after ""wif.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in example 3 when it follows ""zup.""
- Example 4 (identical to example 5) confirms that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

There may be a rule that ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word that comes immediately before it. However, with the existing examples, it cannot be conclusively deduced. The word ""bluf"" occurs after different words and generally corresponds to ""red,"" except when following ""zup,"" where it corresponds to ""yellow."" 

Based on the information given, the best deduction for the meaning of ""bluf"" would be that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" unless it directly follows ""zup,"" in which case it corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"", except when preceded by ""zup,"" then it means ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns in outputs corresponding to each input where ""walm"" is used. It seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color in the output. The number of repetitions of this color is based on the word that precedes ""walm.""

- In the first example, ""zup walm dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Here ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red."" Here ""walm"" follows both ""dax"" and ""wif."" After ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times, and after ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

- In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue."" Here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.

- In the final example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green."" Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

Given these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately prior to ""walm,"" and this repetition occurs three times.

Rule: walm -> Indicates that the preceding color is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,133
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule for the word ""lug"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: lug zup dax wif
Output: blue yellow green red

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Input: lug wif dax wif
Output: blue red green red

Examining the outputs where ""lug"" appears, we notice that the word ""blue"" also appears in the corresponding position. In instances where ""lug"" is the first input word, ""blue"" is the first output word, and so on. This pattern suggests a direct correlation between ""lug"" and ""blue.""

Therefore, based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

Each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. From the examples given where ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output is always ""green"". Therefore, it seems like every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. 

For the examples given:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""blue"" as well, but this may be coincidental since it is not repeated in other examples.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

dax -> ""green""

This means, based on the given examples, that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following relationships between the inputs and outputs:

Input: wif
Output: red
Rule: wif translates to red.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
Rule: zup translates to yellow, and wif remains red.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
Rule: lug translates to blue, wif to red, dax to green when following wif, and walm and zup each to green, zup to yellow when it stands at the end.

Input: zup wif lug
Output: yellow red blue
Rule: The words maintain their previous meanings; zup is yellow, wif is red, and lug is blue.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Rule: The words maintain their previous meanings; zup is yellow, walm becomes yellow when before lug, lug is blue, and dax is green when following wif.

Based on these examples, wif consistently translates to red regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
- Here zup corresponds to yellow.

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red
- Here zup again corresponds to yellow.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
- In this sequence, both occurrences of zup correspond to yellow.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- Once again, zup corresponds to yellow.

Input: lug zup wif
Output: blue yellow red
- And here, zup also corresponds to yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever an input contains ""bluf"" along with ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), the output repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". 

- When ""bluf"" appears alone with ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), the output is the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) repeated twice.

- In situations where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") and another color word, the output is the doubled color word preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: The word ""bluf"" makes the output repeat the color word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated. If preceded by ""dax,"" the color green is repeated. If preceded by ""wif,"" the color red is repeated, and if preceded by ""zup,"" the color yellow is repeated. If the word ""bluf"" is the last word in the input, the preceding color is simply repeated in the output.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color word that precedes ""bluf"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to result in a repetition of the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the deduced patterns:

- dax walm wif -> green green green red (walm repeats the color for dax)
- wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow (walm repeats the color for zup)
- zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red (walm repeats the color for the preceding zup)
- dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red (walm repeats the color for lug)
- lug walm -> blue blue blue (walm repeats the color for lug)

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,134
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
From the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. When ""dax"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is red (wif dax -> red green).
2. When ""dax"" appears alone, it is associated with green (wif dax -> red green).
3. Regardless of what precedes or follows ""dax"" (except for ""wif""), it seems to be linked with the color green (dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green).

Given these examples, we can induce that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green, except when immediately following ""wif,"" in which case the combination ""wif dax"" translates to red green. 

Rule: dax -> green, except when immediately preceded by ""wif,"" in which case wif dax -> red green.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Thus, it can be deduced that ""wif"" means ""red"".
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Every occurrence of the word ""lug"" results in the word ""blue"".
- Every occurrence of the word ""walm"" results in the word ""blue"" if followed by ""zup,"" and ""green"" if not followed by ""zup"".
- Every occurrence of the word ""dax"" results in the word ""green"".
- Every occurrence of the word ""wif"" results in the word ""red"".

Now, looking at the outputs when 'zup' is involved:

- ""lug walm zup walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, lug -> blue, walm -> blue (because zup follows), zup -> ?, walm -> yellow (no blue because it is not followed by zup).
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, zup -> ?, walm -> yellow (because it does not follow zup)
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" leads to ""green yellow blue red blue"". Here, dax -> green, zup -> ?, lug -> blue, wif -> red, lug -> blue.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" leads to ""green green green red red red yellow"". Here, dax -> green, walm -> green (because it is not followed by zup), wif -> red, walm -> red (because it is preceded by wif, otherwise would be green), zup -> yellow (because it follows a walm which was preceded by a non-zup word).
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"". Here, zup -> yellow.

Therefore, the examples indicate that 'zup' results in the output ""yellow"" when it occurs. However, 'zup' also appears to affect the output color of ""walm"" when it follows ""walm,"" changing it from the default ""green"" to ""blue.""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output, and when ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" it changes the output color of ""walm"" to ""blue"". If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" its corresponding output is also changed to ""yellow"".

Therefore:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, when ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red."" There doesn't seem to be a position-based rule or context dependency in this case. ""Bluf"" therefore directly translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> meaning. 

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the previous color word multiple times. More specifically, it seems to duplicate the previous color twice, resulting in a sequence of three identical color words in a row. For example: 

- In the first example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the second example, the situation is the same as the first: ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats it twice more.
- In the third example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", so ""walm"" following ""lug"" means ""blue blue blue"".
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the same rule applies with ""lug"" before ""walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"".

Thus, we can conclude that in the context of these examples, ""walm"" means ""repeat the previous color word two more times"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,135
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. The word ""dax"" does not seem to change in meaning based on position or surrounding words. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output in the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of the word ""dax"" in this context is straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following associations for each nonce word:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" in the first example
- ""walm"" is associated with ""yellow"" but only appears in the sequence once

The consistent rule throughout each example is that the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". There is no example that shows ""wif"" meaning anything other than ""red"". Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can see a pattern that suggests the meaning of the word ""zup"" in relation to colors:

1. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
2. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
3. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
4. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
5. wif zup wif dax -> red yellow red green

From the provided examples, it appears that whenever the word ""zup"" is used in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. No matter the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence or the words that precede or follow it, the output is consistently ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be related to the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. To deduce the rule, let's examine each example:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - Following ""bluf"", ""zup"" is repeated and ""red"" appears again in the output.

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - Following ""bluf"", ""lug"" comes next and ""red"" turns into ""blue"" in the output.

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - Following ""bluf"", there is no additional word, so the color doesn't change from the one corresponding to ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug
   Output: blue blue green blue
   - ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - Following ""bluf"", ""dax"" comes next and ""blue"" turns into ""green"" in the output.

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - Following ""bluf"", there is no additional word, so the color doesn't change from the one corresponding to ""dax"", which is ""green"".

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" signifies a rule where the color associated with the word following it is to be repeated unless ""bluf"" is the last word, in which case the output repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> Replicate the color associated with the word that follows ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the last word, replicate the color of the word before ""bluf"".
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" translates to the word ""blue"" repeated the same number of times as there are words preceding ""walm"" in the input.

So, ""walm"" -> ""blue"" (number of times equal to the number of words before it)

Examples to support the rule:
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (One word before ""walm,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated once)
- ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue"" (Two words before ""walm,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated twice)
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green"" (Three words before ""walm,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated thrice)
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"" (Five words before ""walm,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated five times)
- ""lug walm"" (repeated example) -> ""blue blue blue"" (One word before ""walm,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated once)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,136
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue."" The position of ""lug"" in the input does not seem to affect its output, as it consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of whether it appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the series. Other words such as ""zup"" and ""wif"" seem to correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, following the same consistent pattern regardless of position. Therefore, the rule seems to be quite straightforward.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule related to the word ""dax"":

When ""dax"" is preceded by one or no words, the output is a single ""green"" or consecutive ""green""s that equal the number of syllables in the following word:
- ""dax"" on its own produces one ""green""
- ""dax walm"" (one syllable following ""dax"") produces ""green green green""
- ""dax bluf"" (one syllable following ""dax"") produces ""green green""

When ""dax"" is preceded by more than one word, the ""green"" is not immediately after the words before ""dax"" but follows the pattern of syllable count:
- ""lug zup dax walm"" produces ""blue yellow green green green"", with ""blue yellow"" corresponding to ""lug zup"" and ""green green green"" corresponding to ""dax walm"" (following the syllable count).

When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" which seemingly has one syllable, the output deviates from the previous pattern and results in ""green red"", which is different than the previous rule expectations.

Given this inconsistency and the limited data set, the precise meaning of ""dax"" is difficult to determine. But a probable partial rule could be:

dax -> meaning. Meaning is based on the context within the sentence, generating ""green""s according to the number of syllables in the word that follows it, unless the word is ""wif"" which generates a ""red"". However, this rule is inconsistent and cannot be confirmed without more examples or additional context.

Rule: ""dax"" generates a sequence of ""green""s matching the number of syllables in the word that immediately follows it, unless followed by ""wif"", which generates ""red"". If ""dax"" appears without a following word, it generates a single ""green"". If ""dax"" itself is preceded by more than one word, each word is translated into its separate color code before generating the ""green"" sequence for ""dax"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following mappings from the nonce word to colors:

1. lug -> blue
2. dax -> green
3. zup -> yellow
4. bluf -> blue

With these mappings, we see that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in all the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is both before and after ""dax"" (green), and in both cases, it results in ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears at the end, after a sequence of other colors, and results in ""red"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears in the middle and still corresponds to ""red"".
- The fourth example features ""wif"" alone and the output is simply ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears both at the beginning and the end, and in both positions, it corresponds to ""red"".

From this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the presence of the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" appears in the input sequence; the output consistently contains ""yellow"" for each occurrence of ""zup."" Let's examine each case:

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.
- The repeated ""yellow"" must be associated with ""walm,"" as ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" is consistent with ""green"" from the previous case.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" is not represented in the output, suggesting a possible repetition of ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- ""zup"" stands alone and corresponds to ""yellow"" alone in the output.

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" is consistent with ""yellow"" as seen in the first input-output pair.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" also consistent with previous examples.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" repeating the pattern from the second input-output pair.
- The presence of ""bluf"" in the input leads to a repeated ""red"" in the output, indicating some connection between ""bluf"" and the color ""red.""

From this analysis, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Hence, zup -> yellow.
To deduce the rule for ""bluf,"" let's examine each pair of input and output:

1. Input: wif **bluf** dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
2. Input: zup wif **bluf** zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   
3. Input: lug wif dax **bluf** wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   
4. Input: wif lug **bluf** wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   
5. Input: zup **bluf**
   Output: yellow yellow

Looking at all examples, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word immediately preceding it. Testing this rule against each example:

1. wif **bluf**: red red
2. wif **bluf**: red red
3. dax **bluf**: green green
4. lug **bluf**: blue blue
5. zup **bluf**: yellow yellow

The rule holds for all examples.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.
Based on the patterns evident in the provided input-output pairs, it is possible to deduce a rule for what the nonce word ""walm"" means within the context of these examples. By correlating each occurrence of ""walm"" with the corresponding output and considering the transformation of other words, we can infer the following:

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"" in the given examples:

1. The sequence ""zup lug zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" results in repeating the color immediately before it, ""yellow"" in this case.

2. The sequence ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" showing that ""walm"" again repeats the color immediately before it, ""red"" this time.

3. The sequence ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green,"" which is consistent with the rule that ""walm"" repeats ""yellow,"" the color that appears just before it.

4. The sequence ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" again ""walm"" repeats the immediate preceding color, ""blue"" in this case.

5. Finally, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" maintaining the pattern of ""walm"" repeating the color directly before it, ""red.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm.""

Thus, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,137
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, we can induce the following rules regarding the meaning of ""lug"":

1. When ""lug"" is presented alone, the output is ""blue"". (See Input: lug)
2. When ""lug"" follows ""zup"", the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"". (See Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf)
3. When ""lug"" follows ""dax"", the output becomes ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""green"" for the subsequent words until a different word or the end of the input is reached. (See Input: dax walm zup lug walm)

Thus, ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue"". However, when it directly follows ""dax"", it also affects the following words, making them ""green"". Since the prompt asks to deduce what ""lug"" means and not the behavior of ""dax"", the inducible rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax."" Let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: ""zup dax"" → Output: ""yellow green""
2. Input: ""wif dax zup dax"" → Output: ""red green yellow green""
3. Input: ""dax walm"" → Output: ""green green green""
4. Input: ""dax lug dax lug wif"" → Output: ""green blue green blue red""
5. Input: ""wif dax wif"" → Output: ""red green red""

Firstly, let's note that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green"" in the output. This correspondence appears consistent across all examples, regardless of the words that come before or after ""dax.""

Now, let's break down the rule induction:

- ""zup"" in the first input leads to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""wif"" appears in the second, fourth, and fifth inputs, and it consistently leads to ""red"" in the outputs.
- ""lug"" in the fourth input leads to ""blue"" in the output each time it appears.

From this, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently. Other words also correspond to specific colors:

- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""walm"" -> Since ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" and we know ""dax"" means ""green,"" ""walm"" can be assumed to mean ""green"" as well.

Based on the examples, we can therefore state the rule as:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
From the examples provided, we can derive the rule for the word ""wif"":

- Whenever ""wif"" appears alone or in a sequence, it translates to the color ""red"".
- The presence of ""wif"" does not seem to change depending on its position in the sequence, as it always corresponds to ""red"" regardless of whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence.
  
Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be consistent and context-independent:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the following pattern emerges for the word ""zup"":

- Every instance of ""zup"" is followed by the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- The presence of ""zup"" does not seem to be affected by the context or position in the input sequence.
- ""Zup"" does not modify the output of any other words but is consistent in its own translation to ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". 

So when decoding a sequence, whenever ""zup"" appears, it should be replaced with the word ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> green when following the word dax, yellow when following the word zup, and red when following wif; otherwise, it takes the color of the preceding word.
Considering the given examples, let's look for a pattern:

Example 1:
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Example 2:
Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Example 3:
Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green

Example 4:
Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

Example 5:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Pattern Analysis:
- In Example 1, the sequence of ""lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue red red red blue"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" corresponds to red. The word ""walm"" seems to lead to an extra ""red"" before the final ""lug"", which is blue.
- Example 2 shows that after ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, the ""walm dax"" sequence results in ""yellow yellow green"". It's worth noting that ""dax"" alone corresponds to green, while ""walm"" before ""dax"" adds more yellow than would typically follow from ""zup"" alone.
- Example 3 shows the ""dax walm wif dax"" sequence results in ""green green green red green"". This suggests that ""walm"" placed between ""dax"" and ""wif"" produced an additional ""green"".
- Example 4 shows that ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green"", suggesting that ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to two more greens.
- Example 5 shows that ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", with ""walm"" after ""zup"" leading to two additional yellows.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" two more times before moving to the next color. Therefore:

walm -> The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that when it follows a color word (such as ""lug"", ""dax"", or ""zup""), it doubles the preceeding color before adding the next one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax
    ",Output: red yellow green,red yellow green,True,138
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output colors are directly related to the input words. Each instance of ""lug"" always results in ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Additionally, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""zup"" and ""bluf"" appear to be associated with changes to the sequence of colors rather than a one-to-one correspondence to a specific color.

Given these observations, it is possible to deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue

This implies that whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it directly translates to the color blue in the output.
dax -> meaning. Based on the given examples, where the input ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green,"" the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red."" This can be observed in every instance where ""wif"" is used. For instance, when ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red."" When ""wif"" appears with ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue,"" with ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"" once again. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be consistent:

Rule:
zup -> yellow

In every instance where the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, bluf corresponds to the color that precedes it.

Rule:
- If a color word comes before bluf, bluf takes the color of that word.
- If bluf is the first word, it takes the color of the word immediately following it. 

Hence, in the examples given:
- ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green"" because bluf follows dax, which corresponds to green.
- ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow"" because bluf follows wif, which corresponds to red.
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because bluf follows wif, thus taking the color red.
- ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow"" because bluf follows dax, corresponding to green.
- ""zup bluf wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red"" because the first bluf follows zup, corresponding to yellow, and the second bluf follows wif, corresponding to red.
To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples provided and determine the correlation between the usage of ""walm"" and the resulting outputs.

Examining the outputs, it's clear that ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color immediately before it, for a total of three repetitions in the output sequence.

Let's verify this with the examples:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and in the output, ""red"" is repeated three times after the first instance.

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
   Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" again and corresponds to ""red,"" which is also repeated three times.

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   
   In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated three times.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   
   ""Walm"" follows a ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and we see that ""red"" is repeated three times after its first occurrence.

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output shows ""green"" repeated three times, confirming the rule observed.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> means to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif dax
    ",Output: red green red green,red green red green,True,139
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given input and output examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" There is no variability in output with respect to any variation in input ('lug walm' and 'lug' alone both result in 'blue'). Even when an additional word 'zup' is added in the input, 'lug' still results in the output 'blue.'

Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color output, regardless of the other words' presence. This can be deduced from the fact that every input instance containing ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"" being part of the output sequence.

Firstly, when ""dax"" is present with other words such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif,"" the output always includes the color ""green"" at the position where ""dax"" was inputted.

Secondly, when ""dax"" is the only input, the output is solely ""green,"" which indicates the direct mapping of ""dax"" to ""green,"" regardless of the context or surrounding words.

Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we can analyze the input-output pairs and look for patterns. Let's examine each pairing:

1. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   - Here, ""wif"" occurs at the beginning and before ""zup."" In both cases, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - In this example, ""wif"" occurs after ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" and each occurrence of ""wif"" results in ""red."" It's also followed by other colors without a clear positional correlation.

3. Input: lug zup wif
   Output: blue yellow red
   - ""Wif"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - Here, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and then ""lug""—and both times, it translates to ""red."" 

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""Wif"" follows ""dax"" again and results in ""red.""

Based on these examples, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. However, there is a common element in all cases: ""wif"" is never at the beginning of an input. Yet, when it is used, no matter the preceding or following words, the output is consistently ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" based on the given examples, let's first write down each input next to its corresponding output and then analyze the sequences:

- Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
- Input: lug walm zup -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
- Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug -> Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

In the examples where ""zup"" appears, the output always includes ""yellow"" at the position matching where ""zup"" is placed in the input. 

For instance:
- When ""zup"" is the first word in the input, ""yellow"" is the first word in the output (inputs 1 and 3).
- When ""zup"" is the last word in the input, ""yellow"" is the last word in the output (input 2).
- When ""zup"" is in between other words, ""yellow"" is correspondingly in between the same words in the output (input 4).
- When multiple words appear before and after ""zup"" in the input, ""yellow"" appears at the same position in the output (input 5).

Other words in the examples (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") appear to be consistently translated to their outputs (""red,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow""), regardless of their position in the sequence. However, ""zup"" also outputs ""yellow,"" thus not providing a distinct translation like the other words.

The pattern suggests that ""zup"" does not change meaning based on context or position but maintains a constant output. Based on these observations, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: zup translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Examining the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce what the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to in terms of colors.

Let's consider each example and the color patterns.

1. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   First two words correspond to two different colours.

2. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   First three words correspond to three different colours, but ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word.

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   Again, we see ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word just before it, ""zup"" in this case, which is yellow.

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   Similar to the previous examples, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"" which corresponds to red.

5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
   Again, ""bluf"" repeats the previous color for both of its occurrences.

Based on the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning or rule associated with ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern in the outputs relative to their inputs.

1. In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it (e.g., ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" there are three repetitions of yellow). The word ""wif"" following ""walm"" is red.

    Input: zup walm wif
    Output: yellow yellow yellow red

2. In the second example, the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads again to a repetition of the color associated with ""lug"" (blue repeated three times).

    Input: lug walm
    Output: blue blue blue

3. The third example also follows the pattern of repetition where ""dax"" is associated with green, and after ""walm,"" the repetition stops, and the last color reflects ""lug,"" which is blue.

    Input: dax walm lug
    Output: green green green blue

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows two instances of ""zup"" and results in a repeat of the yellow color associated with ""zup,"" but the repetition now is four times, which might suggest that it repeats the previous color ""plus one additional time"" when two instances precede it. The word ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" to red. The sequence breaks after ""walm"" as usual.

    Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
    Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, and it repeats the blue color twice more as if ""lug"" has a default once prior occurrence before ""walm"". 
    
    Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
    Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. However, if the same word precedes it twice, an additional repetition is added (making it four), while if ""lug"" precedes it but only once in the sequence, it is treated as if ""lug"" appeared twice.

Rule: 
walm -> Causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times. If the preceding word is the same and appears twice in a row, add an extra repetition (four times total). If ""lug"" precedes it but only appears once in the sequence before ""walm,"" it is treated as if ""lug"" appeared twice (three repetitions in total).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,140
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it's possible to infer the rule for what ""dax"" means by analyzing the instances where it occurs and the corresponding output. Here's the analysis:

In every example where ""dax"" is input, the output is ""green.""

- When ""dax"" appears once, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears multiple times, each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Now, looking at the other words: 

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

When these words are input, their respective colors come out as output. 

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in an input, the output is ""red."" Additionally, it seems that ""wif"" causes the word ""red"" to be output once for each occurrence.

Thus:

wif -> red

We do not have sufficient information to deduce exact meanings for ""bluf"" or ""walm,"" since they are mentioned only once and in combination with ""wif,"" but it seems each word in the input corresponds to a single ""red"" in the output, regardless of the actual word. So we can tentatively conclude:

Each input word -> red (in the output)

Consequently, the occurrence of other words in combination with ""wif,"" such as ""bluf"" and ""walm,"" suggests that they may also follow this pattern and translate to ""red."" However, further examples would be needed to verify this for words other than ""wif.""
Based on the examples provided, zup seems to stand for 'yellow.' We can verify this by looking at the position of zup in each input and the corresponding output:

Input: zup lug wif
Output: yellow blue red
Rule: zup is first and corresponds to yellow.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
Rule: zup is second and corresponds to yellow.

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green
Rule: zup is third here and it still corresponds to yellow.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
Rule: zup is second and corresponds to yellow.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
Rule: zup is third here and still corresponds to yellow.

Based on this consistent matching, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Rule: Based on the input-output pairs provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color that is said directly before it. Here is how it works:

1. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green""
   The color before 'bluf' is 'dax', which translates to 'green'. Hence 'bluf' in this context is 'green'.

2. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
   'Dax' is said before 'bluf' and 'dax' means 'green'. Hence 'bluf' is 'green' again.

3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   'Zup' is said before 'bluf' and 'zup' means 'yellow'. Hence 'bluf' is 'yellow' in this context.

4. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" -> ""yellow red red yellow blue""
   Here, 'wif' (which translates to 'red') is said before 'bluf', so 'bluf' becomes 'red'.

5. ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green""
   'Lug' is said before 'bluf', which translates to 'blue'. So here, 'bluf' means 'blue'.

bluf -> meaning: The color that is said directly before the word 'bluf'.
Based on the provided examples, each time the word ""walm"" is used in the input, a repeated sequence of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is produced in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
2. ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to the color ""blue.""
3. ""zup walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" mapping to the color ""yellow.""
4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" again showing that ""walm"" follows ""lug"" with the color ""blue"" and the ""yellow"" following ""zup"" just once.
5. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" not ""dax,"" producing ""blue.""

Rule:
Walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,141
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color blue in each of the provided examples.
Using the given examples, I can infer a pattern for what ""dax"" means in the context of the input and output sequences provided:

1. Input: dax zup → Output: green yellow
2. Input: dax walm → Output: green green green
3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm → Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: dax lug dax wif dax → Output: green blue green red green
5. Input: dax walm zup lug → Output: green green green yellow blue

Analyzing the input-output pairs, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we observe the following:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: wif
Output: red 

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: wif
Output: red

From the above examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears in an input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. There are no instances where ""wif"" results in any output other than ""red."" Therefore, we can conclude that the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every instance it appears in the examples provided. Independent of context and position, ""zup"" is replaced with ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's first look at each instance where the word ""bluf"" appears in the input and the corresponding output.

1. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""
2. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
3. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
5. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""

Now, let's analyze:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif dax wif"" and the corresponding output ends with ""red red."" Since ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" it seems that ""bluf"" is also resulting in a ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is resulting in ""blue"" when following ""lug.""

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax,"" and the outputs are ""red green green."" Again, since ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""wif"" results in ""red,"" it seems ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" here, likely because it follows ""dax.""

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif walm,"" and the output sequence includes ""yellow yellow red red red."" We know ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" while ""walm"" also leads to ""red."" So in this context, ""bluf"" seems to result in ""yellow.""

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""lug,"" and just like in the second example, the output ends with ""blue blue,"" consistent with the idea that ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" when following ""lug.""

Based on these observations, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the previous word:

- When immediately following ""wif dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When immediately following ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- Otherwise, ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color of the word that precedes it.

However, we don't have a case where ""bluf"" is the first word or follows ""zup"" or ""walm"" directly, so there might be additional rules or contexts where ""bluf"" diverges from these patterns.

Rule: bluf -> It appears to take on the color of the preceding word unless it follows specific combinations like ""wif dax"" (where it is ""green"") or ""lug"" (where it is ""blue"").
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's observe its correlation with the output colors across the examples:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug -> Output: green green green yellow blue
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
4. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
5. Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red

We should look for patterns before and after ""walm"" to infer its meaning.

Observations:
- ""walm"" follows the word ""dax"" in every instance.
- The output color for ""walm"" is always green, regardless of its position or the words that follow it.
- The word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green in the output.
- When ""walm"" appears, there is an additional green in the output sequence apart from the green corresponding to ""dax."" This suggests ""walm"" might be related to repeating or duplicating the green color prompted by ""dax.""

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the previous color or adds an additional instance of the last color mentioned in the pattern.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True,142
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue."" 

In every example, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Here are the relevant snippets from the provided input-output pairs:

1. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue""
2. ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"" at the start in ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""
3. In ""zup lug dax lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" both times it appears -> ""yellow blue green blue""
4. ""dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue red"" again shows ""lug"" translating to ""blue.""
5. Finally, ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue"" maintains the consistency of ""lug"" translating to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each individual word translates to a color. The repeated appearance of ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"". Other words such as ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" also correspond to specific colors: ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" possibly to ""green"" as well since ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""

Rule:
dax -> green
The examples provided indicate that each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Given this information, it appears that ""wif"" also consistently corresponds to ""red."" It appears before various other nonce words and doesn't seem to change its meaning based on position or adjacent words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be repeated with the same color as the word that comes before it. The rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word. If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it's yellow; if it follows ""wif,"" it's red; and if it follows ""lug,"" it's blue.
In order to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at its occurrences in the provided examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
2. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
5. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green

In each instance, the word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of three color words. The color word that is repeated three times is the same color word that follows the word ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

1. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow
2. wif walm -> red red red
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax walm -> green green green

Rule: The word ""walm"" followed by another word takes the color meaning of that next word and repeats it three times.

Therefore,

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the following word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow green green green,green yellow yellow yellow,False,143
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
Analyzing the examples provided to determine the meaning of ""dax"":

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

In each case, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There doesn't seem to be any indication that ""dax"" depends on the context or its position within the input sequence. Based on these observations, the meaning of ""dax"" is consistently the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
In the given examples, ""wif"" is consistently associated with the output ""red."" Regardless of what follows ""wif,"" the first color in the output is always ""red,"" and ""wif"" does not appear to modify or affect the other elements in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that the rule for the word ""wif"" is that it corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow.'
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the color word that precedes it.

Explanation:
- When ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

Therefore: bluf -> repeat the preceding color word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the immediate prior color to be repeated three additional times. Here are the observed patterns:

- In the first example, before ""walm"", the last color is ""yellow"" (associated with ""lug""), and after ""walm"", it repeats ""yellow"" three more times.
- In the second example, before ""walm"", the last color is ""red"" (associated with ""wif""), and after ""walm"", it repeats ""red"" three more times.
- The third and fourth examples show that ""dax"" leads to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three more times.
- The fifth example shows that after ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three more times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times. Here's the rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,144
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each word within the input is consistently translated to a specific color in the output. The word ""dax"" shows up in every input and the corresponding output always contains the color ""green."" There is no indication that ""dax"" depends on context or position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" as it pertains to the color in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the corresponding output at the same position.

Thus: zup -> yellow. Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" must also correspond to ""green"" here.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" must also correspond to ""red"" here.
- In the third example, ""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red."" ""Zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""wif"" means ""red."" Thus, in this context, ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow."" Here ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" means ""blue."" So, in this context, ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, which is identical to the second, ""wif bluf"" still translates to ""red red,"" and ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color preceding it in the input sequence. Therefore, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to find patterns in the examples given. Let's examine how the word ""walm"" affects the output in each input:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in two additional yellow outputs; ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in two additional red outputs.

2. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in additional blue outputs; ""walm"" after ""zup"" again results in additional yellow outputs; ""walm"" after ""wif"" again results in additional red outputs. 

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in additional green outputs.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in additional yellow outputs, consistent with previous examples.

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in additional blue outputs, consistent with previous examples.

From these examples, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it twice more.

Therefore, the rule induction for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repetition of the last color word mentioned two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,145
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the rule for the meaning of ""dax,"" let us examine the given examples. We see that each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears once in the output. The position of ""green"" correlates with the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. 

For instance, in the first example, ""dax"" is the first word in the input, and ""green"" is the first color in the output. In the second example, ""dax"" is the second word, and ""green"" is the second color in the output.

This pattern holds across all provided examples, regardless of what other words (""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") are present or their order in the input.

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output sequence, and its position as a word in the input sequence matches the position of the color ""green"" in the output sequence.
  
dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" corresponds to it in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" in the outputs each time it appears in the input. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the surrounding words, the corresponding output is consistently ""yellow"":

- ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green""
- ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow""
- ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow""
- ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red""
- ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with their respective outputs:

1. ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""

2. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

3. ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""

4. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> ""yellow green green yellow green""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""

5. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

Now, considering the position of ""bluf"" in each input, we can look at the corresponding outputs for clues about its meaning. It appears that ""bluf"" correlates with a color present in the output but not accounted for by the other terms.

In the first and second examples, ""bluf"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively, both of which are found elsewhere in those sequences. However, in the third, fourth, and fifth examples, ""bluf"" is directly paired with ""green,"" which is not present in those sequences before ""bluf.""

Considering this, it can be deduced that ""bluf"" is repeated in the colors found so far in the sequence. If ""blue"" hasn't appeared yet - ""bluf"" will correspond to another color already mentioned, otherwise, it defaults to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> If ""blue"" has not appeared in the sequence before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the preceding color; if ""blue"" has appeared, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the output patterns in relation to the input.

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to a sequence of three ""yellow"", ""dax"" to one ""green"", and ""lug"" to one ""blue"".

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" to two more ""green"".

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
""zup"" corresponds to three ""yellow"" and ""walm"" appears to have no output, suggesting it might be null or a delimiter of sorts.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" seems to insert a ""blue"", ""lug"" is not followed by output but precedes ""zup"", and ""walm"" still appears to have no output following it, reinforcing the idea of it being a delimiter or a null word.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and once again, ""walm"" has no direct output, adding more evidence that it might be a null output or delimiter.

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to no color output in the pattern and might act as a delimiter or indicate a null state in the sequence. It appears not to generate any additional output of its own.

walm -> no corresponding output; acts as a possible delimiter or represents a null state in the pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red yellow red,red yellow yellow,False,146
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" correlates with a particular color in the output. Comparing the outputs to the corresponding inputs where ""lug"" appears, we can establish a pattern:

- dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
- lug wif bluf -> blue red red
- lug zup wif lug -> blue yellow red blue

In each output, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Thus, we can deduce:

Rule: lug -> blue
To identify the meaning of ""dax,"" we can compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs to see where ""dax"" appears and what word appears in its place in the output.

Let's consider each instance of ""dax"" in the provided examples:

1. Input: dax zup / Output: green yellow
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf / Output: blue red red green blue blue
3. Input: zup walm dax lug / Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
4. Input: lug zup dax lug dax / Output: blue yellow green blue green
5. Input: dax zup lug wif lug / Output: green yellow blue red blue

From the examples, we can derive the following associations:
- Whenever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- Other words like ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively.

Based on the above observations, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" is directly translated to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be consistent:

- ""wif"" in isolation translates to ""red.""
- Given ""wif"" followed by another word, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and it appears that the other words each have their own color representation.

Here are the observations from the given input/output pairs:

- ""dax lug wif lug"" -> ""green blue red blue""
  - Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" The color repeats with the second ""lug.""

- ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
  - ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
  - ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""walm"" must repeat the color ""red.""

Given this pattern, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its placement in the sequence of words.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Analyzing the given examples and the associated outputs, it seems the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the color that follows it. Here are the observed pairings:

- wif bluf -> red red
- dax bluf -> green green
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- lug bluf -> blue blue

Each time 'bluf' is encountered, it produces a repetition of the color word that corresponds to the preceding nonce word in the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be that 'bluf' causes the preceding color word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word that comes before 'bluf'.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" directly influences the output's color sequence. Each occurrence of ""walm"" seems to lead to a repetition of the color that directly precedes it. I will examine each input and its corresponding output to deduce the rule:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is associated with ""yellow."" Thus, ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" leading to the repetition of ""green"".

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - As in the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is a repetition of ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) resulting in the repetition of ""red.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) hence there's a repetition of ""green.""

From the patterns observed, it seems ""walm"" acts as a rule to reproduce the color associated with the word that comes before it. It can be noted that the presence of ""walm"" does not change the color associated with the words that follow it but only affects the color that directly precedes it.

Therefore, the rule is:
walm -> Reproduce the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the repetition of the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes it, for as many times as it is present in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True,147
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
To find the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the outputs in each example and find what corresponds:

1. Input: wif dax zup wif 
   Output: red green yellow red
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green.""

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - Again, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug zup
   Output: green blue yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red
   - ""dax"" stands between ""yellow"" and ""red"" corresponding to ""green.""

From these examples, every time we see the word ""dax,"" we see ""green"" in its place in the output. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the frequency and position of ""zup"" in various inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is three times ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" is preceded and followed by ""dax,"" the corresponding output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
3. When ""zup"" follows ""lug dax"" and is followed by ""dax walm wif,"" the corresponding output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
4. When ""zup"" is preceded by ""dax walm"" and followed by ""walm,"" the corresponding output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
5. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm wif,"" the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Based on the given examples, ""zup"" seems to translate consistently to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the words that come before or after it. It does not appear to change the output of other words around it, as their corresponding outputs (e.g., ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""red"" for ""wif"") remain consistent in the presence and absence of ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule:
Based on the input and output examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" when translated to the output. Following the examples precisely:

- In the first input ""lug wif bluf,"" if we translate ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""
- In the second input ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Thus, ""bluf"" must translate to ""red"" as it is surrounded by words that translate to different colors and the position of ""bluf"" corresponds to a ""red"" output.
- Following the same logic, each input contains the word ""bluf"" which corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the contexts it appears in and compare the inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
2. ""dax walm zup lug"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue""
3. ""dax walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red""
4. ""lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue green green green""
5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""

Looking at these examples, we can see:

- When ""walm"" appears following ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears following ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears following ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated but not three times — possibly because ""wif"" interrupts the sequence.
- However, when ""walm"" appears following ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, it seems ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. However, the sequence can be interrupted by the insertion of another word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,148
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given outputs, regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output. When ""dax"" appears before another color-word, it is translated to ""green"" followed by the translation of that color-word. When ""dax"" comes after another color-word, it again translates to ""green"" but follows the translation of the preceding color-word.

Here are the rules deduced from the examples:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" (seen in the first two examples)
- ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" (third example)
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" (fourth and fifth examples)
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" (fifth example)

So, the general rule for the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be that it translates to ""green"" regardless of its position relative to other words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" can be mapped directly to the color ""red."" Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: wif -> red.
Analyzing the given examples, let's try to determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup.""

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
2. Input: dax zup wif zup
   Output: green yellow red yellow
   
3. Input: dax zup lug
   Output: green yellow blue
   
4. Input: dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow red
   
5. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green

We can see that whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. None of the other nonce words (wif, walm, dax, and lug) consistently align with ""yellow"" in the outputs. Therefore, we can deduce from the examples that the meaning of ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" is directly translated to a color that is repeated twice. The color associated with ""bluf"" depends on the word that precedes it. Let's examine the examples:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" implying that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it means ""red.""
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" implying that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" Here, ""wif bluf"" still results in ""red red,"" while the other words are associated with ""green.""
- ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" results in ""yellow yellow red blue green."" Again, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" and the subsequent words are associated with their respective colors.
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow."" Here, the pattern of ""wif bluf"" meaning ""red red"" and ""zup bluf"" meaning ""yellow yellow"" holds true.

Rule:
bluf -> a color word that is repeated twice, with the specific color determined by the word prior to ""bluf"": ""wif"" dictates ""red"" and ""zup"" dictates ""yellow.""
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" seems to increase the count of the color represented by the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with that word is produced an additional two times. For example:
- After ""dax"" which is green, yields ""green green green"" (an additional two greens after the one naturally produced by the word ""dax"").
- After ""wif"" which is red, yields ""red red red"" (an additional two reds after the one naturally produced by the word ""wif"").
- After ""lug"" which is blue, yields ""blue blue blue"" (an additional two blues after the one naturally produced by the word ""lug"").
- After ""zup"" which is yellow, yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" (an additional two yellows after the one naturally produced by the word ""zup"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: lug -> blue

In all provided examples, every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. Hence, it can be deduced that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be consistent across all examples. In every instance where ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the output is ""green."" 

Therefore, the rule I deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding to each input where ""wif"" appears and try to identify a pattern.

Input: wif
Output: red
- Here, ""wif"" directly translates to ""red.""

Input: zup wif lug
Output: yellow red blue
- ""wif"" again translates to ""red,"" consistent with the first example.

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
- Each instance of ""wif"" translates to ""red"" except where ""dax"" is involved, which means ""green."" Also, ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
- Consistent with previous patterns, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" However, ""walm"" is not followed by an output color, which means the last two ""green"" in the output must correspond to ""dax"" and ""walm."" Since ""dax"" has already been established as ""green,"" ""walm"" must also mean ""green.""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- The first ""red"" corresponds to ""wif,"" and given the previous rule deduced for ""walm,"" the other two ""red"" would imply ""walm"" means ""red"" here, which contradicts the previous example. Since there's no new context to suggest a different rule, this could indicate an inconsistency unless ""walm"" changes meaning based on context, which has not been established in the given examples.

Based on the given examples, the most consistent rule for ""wif"" appears to be:
Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

However, the last example suggests there might be another rule at play affecting the meaning of ""walm,"" but there's not enough information to deduce what that rule might be. Assuming no further context is provided, we focus only on the word ""wif"" and arrive at the rule:
wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

- Input: ""zup wif"" -> Output: ""yellow red""
  Here, ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and translates to ""yellow.""

- Input: ""zup dax bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow green green""
  The ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" which correspond to ""green"" and ""green,"" respectively, with ""zup"" again translating to ""yellow.""

- Input: ""wif zup"" -> Output: ""red yellow""
  ""zup"" follows ""wif"" in this sequence and translates to ""yellow,"" consistently with previous examples.

- Input: ""wif dax zup wif"" -> Output: ""red green yellow red""
  ""zup"" is placed after ""wif"" and ""dax"" and before the second ""wif."" Each instance of ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

- Input: ""wif bluf zup"" -> Output: ""red red yellow""
  The sequence ends with ""zup,"" which continues to correspond to ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:
zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given examples and their outputs.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

If we look at the first and second examples, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" while ""lug wif bluf"" leads to ""blue red red."" Here, we can guess that ""lug"" means blue and ""wif"" means red, since these associations are consistent in both examples. Given this guess, it would suggest that ""bluf"" means yellow when it follows ""zup,"" but red when it follows ""wif."" But since the output for ""bluf"" in the second example is still the same color twice (red red), this rule isn't quite right.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

This is a repetition of the first example and confirms the association of ""zup bluf"" with ""yellow yellow.""

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue

Here ""lug wif"" yields ""blue red"" as before. ""dax"" gets associated with green when it's before ""bluf."" Also, ""bluf"" following ""dax"" outputs green green; following ""wif lug"" outputs red blue, which is the output for each of those words on their own. 

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

In the last example, ""dax lug"" yields ""green blue,"" and the presence of ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green red red green."" Here, ""wif bluf"" might lead to ""green red,"" and ""bluf dax"" to ""red green.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word preceding it followed by the color output of the word following it. However, this doesn't hold consistently since in the second example, ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"" and not ""blue red"" which would follow the rule suggested by later examples.

The examples contain contradictions and do not clearly demonstrate a consistent pattern. To reach an accurate conclusion, we would need more data or examples that establish a clear pattern for the meaning of ""bluf.""

Rule:
Given the inconsistencies and lack of a clear pattern, it is difficult to determine a precise rule for ""bluf."" The best hypothesis, with the available data where ""bluf"" appears to take the color output of the word before it and the word after it, is inconsistent and does not hold up across all examples. Additional patterns or rules cannot be determined without further examples or clarification.
To determine the meaning of ""walm"" based on the provided examples, we will first observe the pattern of colors in the output sequences. Let's consider the output colors corresponding to the presence of ""walm"":

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
2. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   
3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   
5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   
Now, let's analyze the colors before and after ""walm"" in each instance:

1. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the colors red red red follow.
2. ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup,"" resulting in green green followed by yellow.
3. ""walm"" follows ""lug wif"" and the colors are blue blue blue.
4. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" within the sequence and is followed by ""zup,"" with the corresponding colors being green green followed by yellow.
5. ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif lug,"" with the resulting colors being yellow yellow followed by red blue.

Looking closely, ""walm"" seems to be associated with producing a sequence of three repeated colors. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the following three color outputs are the same:

1. red red red
2. green green green
3. blue blue blue
4. green green green
5. yellow yellow yellow

But there's another element to consider: the color before ""walm"" changes in the fifth example. When ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" the three repeated colors change from the typical sequence to yellow. This suggests that the color before ""walm"" influences what the triplet color will be.

Analyzing further, if we look at the word preceding ""walm"" in each input, we find the corresponding color for that word, which then repeats three times after ""walm.""

1. ""wif"" -> red -> red red red
2. ""dax"" -> green -> green green green
3. ""lug"" -> blue -> blue blue blue
4. ""dax"" -> green -> green green green
5. ""zup"" -> yellow -> yellow yellow yellow

When ""lug wif"" appears before ""walm,"" ""wif"" seems to be the influencing word as ""lug"" is repeated before the ""walm"" triplet.

Thus, ""walm"" appears to represent the rule of repeating the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,150
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever 'lug' appears in the input, it is translated to 'blue' in the output.
By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax.""

Let's analyze the given examples:

1. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
Here, ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" but let's look further for confirmation.

2. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> ""blue green red blue""
The word ""lug"" consistently aligns with the color ""blue"" in both its occurrences, which means ""dax"" here also corresponds to ""green.""

3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Note that ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""blue,"" perhaps due to some repetition effect.

4. ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue""
The word ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and produces ""green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may have a modifying effect on the word ""dax"" or vice versa. However, when ""lug"" is last, its color is ""blue.""

5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
Here, ""dax"" seems to be followed by another color term, ""green."" Without additional examples, the specific influence of ""bluf"" is unclear.

Based on these examples, we cannot deduce a context-dependent rule for ""dax"" because the examples do not provide variable contexts or modifications. However, we see that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in all instances where it is not followed by the word ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: dax -> green, unless modified by specific contextual rules which have not been clearly demonstrated.

To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each example input and its corresponding output closely:

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

3. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

Breaking down the occurrences:

- Every time the word ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" is in the output.
- Every time ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is in the output.

In examples 1 and 3, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""red"" always precedes ""blue"" in the output. In example 4, ""wif"" is following ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow red,"" indicating that ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" since ""zup"" is already established to correlate with ""yellow."" Example 2 reaffirms this pattern, as ""wif"" once again results in ""red"" in the output sequence. Finally, example 5 shows ""wif"" followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to the output ""red green,"" and we've observed that ""walm lug"" consistently maps to ""green blue."" This suggests ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" reaffirming that ""wif"" is constant in its representation of ""red.""

Therefore, based on the examples provided, it can be induced that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: ""zup"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word one extra time. 

Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. ""dax zup dax"" translates to ""green yellow green"". Since ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", zup causes the preceding ""green"" to be repeated once, resulting in ""yellow"".

2. ""wif walm zup walm"" gives us ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and ""walm"" is associated with ""yellow"". The zup here follows ""walm"" and repeats ""yellow"" once more, resulting in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"".

3. ""dax zup"" becomes ""green yellow"". Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", which repeats ""green"" once, leading to ""yellow"".

4. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". The pattern indicates that ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", ""walm"" with ""yellow"", and ""wif"" with ""red"". Here, ""zup"" follows both ""walm"" and ""lug"", and in both cases, it repeats the color associated with the word before it.

5. ""zup dax walm"" turns into ""yellow green green green"". The ""zup"" at the beginning repeats the color of ""dax"" (""green""), and since there is no preceding color, it seems to initiate the sequence with ""yellow"". This case is unique because ""zup"" precedes any color words, which suggests that ""zup"" can also initiate a sequence with its own associated ""yellow"" when not following another color word.

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" is that it repeats the color associated with the preceding word one more time, except when it initiates the sequence, where it is translated as ""yellow"". 

zup -> repeat the color of the preceding word one more time, or ""yellow"" if it starts the sequence.
Analyzing the given examples, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""bluf.""

1. In the first example:
Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue
- Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second instance of ""red.""

2. In the second example:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. In the third example:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second instance of ""red"" again.

4. In the fourth example:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second instance of ""red"" once more.

5. The fifth example:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again, similar to example two.

From the first and second rules, we can deduce:

1. ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red when it is preceded by ""wif.""
2. ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow when it is preceded by ""zup.""

Since there are no contradictions in these observations across the examples, we can combine the rules into one:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If preceded by ""zup,"" it is yellow; if preceded by ""wif,"" it is red.

Bluf -> meaning: Bluf corresponds to the color of the word directly preceding it within the given pattern, with the specific mappings of ""zup"" to yellow and ""wif"" to red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the input and the output in each example.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

The word ""walm"" appears to add three of the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is three additional greens.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is three additional reds.
- In the third example, similar to the first, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), resulting in three additional greens.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is three additional blues.
- In the fifth example, similar to the second, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in three additional reds.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" means to triple the output color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup walm dax lug
    ",Output: blue yellow blue blue blue green blue,blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,False,151
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, each ""lug"" corresponds with a specific color. The task is to determine what blue represents as it is the output whenever ""lug"" is the input. Here are the observations:

1. When ""lug"" is present, the output color is blue: ""dax walm lug"" -> green green green blue, ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> green blue blue green, ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue.

2. Each time ""lug"" appears, the word before and after it does not affect the output being blue for ""lug"": ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue, ""lug wif dax"" -> blue red green.

From these observations, it seems ""lug"" consistently correlates with the color blue, regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, each input word corresponds to a specific color output. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the other words around it. Other words also correspond to colors, such as ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". In every example where ""wif"" appears, the output includes the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There is no variation in this translation across the examples, which suggests that the meaning of ""zup"" is fixed and not context-dependent.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
Reviewing the input-output pairs, we can try to deduce what ""bluf"" translates to:

1. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
2. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow
3. dax wif bluf -> green red red
4. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
5. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red

Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first and last examples, the word ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" leading to a sequence of “yellow yellow” in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and results in ""green red.""
- In the third example, again ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red.""
- The fourth example has ""bluf"" appearing twice, following ""lug,"" and outputs ""blue blue.""

It is apparent that ""bluf"" is influenced by its preceding word. The rule seems to revolve around duplicating the color of the word that comes before ""bluf."" Let's apply this rule to each case:

1. The word before bluf is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so bluf -> yellow.
2. The word before bluf is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so bluf -> green.
3. The word before bluf is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so bluf -> red.
4. The word before bluf is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so bluf -> blue.
5. The word before bluf is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so bluf -> yellow (first instance) and the word before the second instance of bluf is ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so bluf (second instance) -> yellow.

The rule seems to be: bluf duplicates the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning - duplicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I'll look at the correspondence between the input and output in each example. By doing so, we can identify patterns and likely assign a meaning to ""walm"" within this context.

Let's examine each instance of ""walm"" in the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
2. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
5. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow

From these examples, we can try to discern the rule for ""walm"" based on the color that follows after its use in the output:

- In example 1, after ""walm,"" the color is green. Before ""walm,"" ""dax"" is present, and its corresponding output is green too.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by green, and once again, ""dax"" precedes it.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by yellow, the same as ""zup"" which precedes it.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by blue and preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds with blue.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed first by green (preceded by ""dax"") and then by red (preceded and followed by ""wif""). This could suggest that ""walm"" serves as a duplicate of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

From this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup wif dax
    ",Output: red yellow red green,red yellow red green,True,152
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In every example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Analyzing the sequences provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There is no variation in output color whenever ""dax"" appears in the input:

- Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
  - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

- Input: zup bluf wif lug dax -> Output: yellow yellow red blue green
  - ""dax"" corresponds to the last ""green"" in the output.

- Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

- Input: lug dax lug wif -> Output: blue green blue red
  - ""dax"" corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output.

- Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
  - ""dax"" corresponds to the third ""green"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule that appears to be at play is:

Rule: dax -> green. 

There is no indication that the meaning of ""dax"" depends on any context or neighboring words—it consistently translates to ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll examine each input and its corresponding output, looking for patterns that connect the word ""wif"" to the output color.

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

3. Input: zup wif lug wif
   Output: yellow red blue red

4. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

From these examples, let's scrutinize the role of ""wif"" in each:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""red."" Since ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red red red,"" ""wif"" by itself might be inducing the first ""red.""

2. Without any preceding words, ""wif walm"" gives us ""red red red,"" which matches the number of reds that ""walm"" gave in example 1.

3. Here, ""wif"" occurs twice. First, it follows ""zup,"" yielding ""yellow red,"" and then it precedes ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue red."" Since ""lug"" alone corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" seems to add a ""red"" before the color linked with the next word.

4. In this input, ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""red"" after the ""blue"" associated with ""lug."" This reinforces the notion that ""wif"" adds a ""red"" before the color associated with the subsequent word.

5. ""Wif"" appears first, followed by ""bluf"" and ""dax walm."" ""Bluf"" doesn't appear in any other examples, but considering ""wif"" produces ""red"" before whatever comes next and ""dax"" has consistently resulted in a ""green"" color, ""bluf"" probably corresponds to ""red,"" and ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""

Based on the patterns observed, ""wif"" appears to add a ""red"" before the color that is associated with the next word in the sequence. If there is no following word to provide context (like in Example 2), ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> Adds ""red"" before the color associated with the following word, or translates to ""red"" if there is no following word.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""zup."" Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - Zup triggers the output of ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - Zup triggers ""yellow,"" and each subsequent word triggers a color that corresponds to it.

3. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - The last two ""yellow"" outputs are preceded by ""zup.""

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Again, ""zup"" directly corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" irrespective of position.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - The ""yellow"" at the end is preceded by ""zup.""

By observing that the output ""yellow"" always follows the input ""zup,"" regardless of its position or the words around it, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

So, zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at each input and the corresponding output, identifying any patterns that could help us figure out the rule:

- When ""bluf"" appears, the color after ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"".
- This pattern holds true regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input.

Input: wif bluf dax walm 
Output: red red green green green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to green. So ""bluf"" here means repeat the color that follows, which is green.

Input: wif bluf lug zup 
Output: red red blue yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to blue. Here ""bluf"" again means repeat the color that follows, which is blue.

Input: dax bluf wif lug 
Output: green green red blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to red. Here ""bluf"" again means repeat the color that follows, which is red.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif 
Output: green green red yellow red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to red. The pattern continues with ""bluf"" meaning repeat the color that follows, which is red.

Input: lug wif lug bluf 
Output: blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" is at the end but the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue) is repeated after ""bluf"", indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it when it is at the end.

Rule:

bluf -> The word ""bluf"" signifies repetition of the color of the next word if it is followed by another word, and repetition of the color of the preceding word if it is the last word.

Thus, the rule can be understood as:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word following it, or if it is the last word, repeat the color of the word preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's correlate the instances of ""walm"" in the examples with the outputs:

1. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
3. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow""
4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""

Looking at these examples:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is a repetition of yellow (Example 1 & Example 5).
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of green (Example 2 & Example 3).
- When ""walm"" follows a sequence of other words, including ""zup"" or ""dax,"" it seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word before ""walm"" (Example 3 & Example 4).

From the given data, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue blue blue,False,153
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The examples demonstrate that whenever the nonce word ""lug"" is used, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" correlates with a change of color output from the previous word. The first mention of ""dax"" outputs a color, and subsequent mentions output the same color as the previous until ""dax"" appears again.

Rule:

If ""dax"" appears after a color word, it outputs the next color in a sequence starting from blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the sequence after ""dax"" starts with ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the sequence after ""dax"" starts with ""green.""

If ""dax"" appears as the first word or follows another ""dax,"" it outputs ""green.""
- Example: ""dax"" on its own outputs ""green,"" and ""dax walm wif walm zup"" shows ""dax"" first outputting ""green,"" followed by repetitions of color changes from ""walm"" and ""wif,"" and a reset to ""green"" when ""dax"" is met again before continuing the sequence.

Rule: dax -> outputs the next color in the sequence starting from blue if following a color word, or outputs green if it is the first word or follows another ""dax.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates directly to the color red in the output:

Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow **yellow red**
Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow **red** red
Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow **red** red yellow blue
Input: lug dax zup wif -> Output: blue green yellow **red**
Input: wif -> Output: **red**

It is notable that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. There are no examples that contradict this observation.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze each input and its corresponding output line by line.

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

2. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red

3. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the word that precedes it has its color repeated in the output. For example, in the first and fifth examples, ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" makes it repeated, resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second input, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red,"" again with the preceding word's color doubled.
- The third example reinforces the pattern, with ""lug"" translating to ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf"" resulting in ""blue blue.""
- The same happens in the fourth input, where ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output includes ""red red.""

Rule: 

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the examples provided and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax  
   Output: green green green yellow blue green  
   - ""dax"" at the beginning and end corresponds to green.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

2. Input: dax zup dax walm  
   Output: green yellow green green green  
   - ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to green, both times before and after ""zup"" (yellow). 
   - ""walm"" at the end gives us green again.

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm  
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow  
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and appears at the beginning and end.
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow here (in this context, could be because ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup"").
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""walm"" at the end turns into yellow.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm  
   Output: green green green red red red  
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" also turns into red.

5. Input: dax wif walm  
   Output: green red red red  
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" again corresponds to red.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color of the word that comes directly before it. If it's at the beginning of the sequence or after ""dax,"" it corresponds to green. After ""wif,"" it's red. After ""zup,"" it's yellow. There's no example with ""walm"" following ""lug"" to determine its behavior in that context.

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to the color of the preceding word; if it comes after ""dax"" or at the beginning, it defaults to green; if it's after ""wif,"" it corresponds to red; and if it's after ""zup,"" it's yellow.

So, the meaning could be:

walm -> meaning: a modifier that repeats the color of the preceding word, with a default to green if it follows ""dax"" or is at the beginning.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: green yellow green blue green,green yellow green blue green,True,154
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each subsequent word after ""dax"" in the input corresponds to a color as well, with ""wif"" corresponding to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""bluf"" to green as well. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not affect its associated color—whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end, ""dax"" always translates to green.
After examining the provided examples, a pattern related to the position of ""wif"" and the color output is emerging. Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: ""dax wif""
   Output: ""green red""
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""wif"" is in the second position, it corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: ""wif bluf dax""
   Output: ""red red green""
   Analysis: ""wif"" in the first position corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" has not appeared in other examples, so it's unclear what it corresponds to, and ""dax"" at the end corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: ""wif zup dax""
   Output: ""red yellow green""
   Analysis: ""wif"" in the first position corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" at the end corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: ""wif dax wif""
   Output: ""red green red""
   Analysis: ""wif"" at the beginning and the end of the sequence both correspond to ""red,"" with ""dax"" in the middle corresponding to ""green.""

5. Input: ""dax lug wif""
   Output: ""green blue red""
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" presumably to ""blue"" (though it is the only instance of it), and ""wif"" in the last position corresponds to ""red.""

It seems that the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the presented examples, the rule seems to be as follows:

zup -> yellow

This can be succinctly expressed as:

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to correlate its presence in the input with the color value in the output. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""zup"" to yellow. Since ""bluf"" also outputs yellow, we can't draw a conclusion from this example alone as both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the same color.

2. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   In this case, ""zup"" matches yellow and ""dax"" matches green. ""bluf"" now matches green, different from the yellow in the first example.

3. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   ""wif"" outputs red, and we already established that ""zup"" outputs yellow. ""lug"" matches with blue, leaving us with ""bluf"" corresponding to red, which is different from the previous conclusions.

4. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
   We know that ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red. The color corresponding to ""bluf"" here is blue, matching with ""lug.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   Knowing ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" corresponds to red once again, aligning with ""wif.""

From these examples, we can deduce a pattern:

- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""dax,"" it outputs green.
- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""zup,"" it outputs yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""wif,"" it outputs red.
- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""lug,"" it outputs blue.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the noun that comes immediately after it. This can be interpreted as ""bluf"" mimicking or reflecting the color associated with the next word. However, when ""bluf"" ends the sentence or there's no known word after it, by default it seems to take the color green, as in the second example.

Rule: bluf -> reflects the color of the following word, or green by default if it is the last word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples given, let's analyze the input in relation to the respective output:

1. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

Here we have ""walm"" preceding two greens. Notice that ""dax"" also gives us a green.

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Here ""walm"" is between two greens, and again, ""dax"" is associated with green, while ""wif"" and ""bluf"" result in red.

3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

Once more, ""walm"" is between green outputs and ""dax"" results in green, ""wif"" in red, and ""zup"" in yellow.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Here ""walm"" comes after a ""wif"" and is followed by ""lug wif"" leading to the output ""red blue red."" ""Wif"" seems to consistently result in red, ""bluf"" in red, ""lug"" in blue, and ""dax"" in green.

5. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

In this case, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""red yellow,"" and is also preceded by a red (""wif"").

Comparing all instances, the presence of ""walm"" results in repeated colors. Specifically, the repeated color appears to be the color that follows the first occurrence of ""walm"". Thus, it appears that ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the color that follows it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the following word to be repeated. 
For example, if ""walm"" is followed by a word that translates to green, ""walm"" will result in the output of additional greens.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,155
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue' in each example provided.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in each example. In particular, we should focus on the position of ""dax"" and the corresponding color in the output. Let's take a look at the examples provided:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the fourth color, ""green,"" in the output.

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first and second ""green"" in the output (since ""walm"" is repeated).

4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

From all the examples presented, we can see that ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green
By analyzing the examples provided, we can infer the following relationships between the nonce words and the colors:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Now, let's go through the examples to see how ""wif"" behaves.

1. ""lug zup wif lug""
   - We translate this to blue yellow red blue, which shows that ""wif"" stands between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue), and translates to red.

2. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm""
   - Although ""walm"" isn't directly translated, we can see that ""wif"" is before ""lug"" (blue), translating to red.

3. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug""
   - Similarly, ""wif"" appears before ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue), representing red both times.

4. ""wif lug""
   - ""Wif"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue), which results in red blue.

5. ""zup wif""
   - ""Zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""wif"", translating to yellow red.

From these observations, it's clear that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red, regardless of the words that come before or after it.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples regardless of its position within the sequence of words.
Based on the provided examples, we need to induce what the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to in the output, given its consistent translation across different contexts.

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

Here, ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""lug,"" and ""lug"" is then followed by ""dax."" In the output, ""yellow"" correlates with ""zup,"" ""blue"" with ""bluf,"" and ""green"" with ""dax.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

In this example, ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input and translates to ""green"" in the output. Considering ""green"" corresponds with ""dax,"" it might appear that ""bluf"" takes the same color as the preceding word, which is 'green' in this case.

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green,"" just as in the previous example.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" but translates to ""blue,"" which deviates from the prior pattern if ""bluf"" were solely to replicate the color of the word directly preceding it.

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Here ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" but ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" which again challenges the direct replication idea.

By examining the color associations, it appears ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or neighboring words.

Rule: bluf -> blue

""Bluf"" means ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correspondence between the input and output in each example. We notice that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output has a sequence of the same color repeated. The color precedes the sequence of repeated colors, potentially indicating that the color directly preceding ""walm"" determines the repeated color in the output.

Let's validate this with the examples provided:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""Wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and we see ""red red red"" in the output.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""Dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and we see ""green green green"" in the output.

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Wif"" comes before the first ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red.""
   - ""Zup"" comes before the second ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""Lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and we see ""blue blue blue"" in the output.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""Dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and again we see ""green green green"" in the output.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,156
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the translations from the given inputs to their respective outputs.
Based on the examples given, we can analyze the presence and position of the nonce word ""dax"" in each input and its corresponding output to deduce what ""dax"" means:

1. ""dax lug wif lug"" translates to ""green blue red blue."" ""Dax"" appears at the beginning,
and ""green"" is the first color in the output.
2. ""dax walm zup lug"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue."" Here, ""dax"" is followed by different words but the output always starts with ""green.""
3. ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow,"" with ""dax"" at the beginning and ""green"" as the first output color again.
4. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" turns into ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" ""Dax"" appears at the start, and the corresponding output begins with ""green.""
5. ""dax lug dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue green blue red."" ""Dax"" is used twice, and in both instances, it corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

From these observations, we can infer that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context of the surrounding words. Therefore, we can conclude that the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can establish a pattern for what ""wif"" means by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- 'wif' correlates with the first 'red'.
- We can hypothesize that 'bluf' means 'red'.
- 'dax' seems to correlate with 'green'.

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
- 'dax' at the beginning correlates with 'green'.
- 'walm' is correlated with 'green' too, based on the positions of 'walm' and 'green'.
- 'wif' here is followed by 'red', consistent with the first example.
- 'lug' is the only new word, and it correlates with 'blue'.

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- 'wif' correlates with 'red' again.
- 'zup' is a new word which corresponds to 'yellow'.

Input: wif
Output: red
- 'wif' on its own results in 'red', reinforcing the notion that 'wif' correlates to 'red'.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- 'lug' from the previous example means 'blue'.
- 'wif' associating with the second 'red'.
- 'walm', from previous examples, should mean 'green', yet here it is followed by 'red red'. This inconsistency might suggest that there is a rule about repetition or sequence that we are not told about. However, given all the information at hand, we can only form the rule based on consistent evidence.

Since 'wif' consistently results in 'red' regardless of its position or the other colors, we can induce:

Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup"":

1. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

4. Input: zup lug dax lug
   Output: yellow blue green blue

5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

We can see that every time the word ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is in the corresponding position in the output. ""Zup"" does not appear to change meaning depending on context; it is consistently translated to ""yellow"". Other words such as ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" correspond to different colors (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"").

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the provided input/output pairs and see if we can identify a consistent pattern for the word ""bluf.""

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Analyzing the patterns, ""bluf"" is always translated to ""blue"" in the output. It appears consistently across all examples that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color blue, regardless of context or position in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that 'walm' takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If we examine the outputs, 'walm' generates repeated color outputs that match the color associated with the word right before it. Let's break down the examples:

1. In ""zup lug walm"", 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow, and 'lug' to blue. 'walm' follows 'lug' and therefore repeats the color blue multiple times: Output: yellow blue blue blue.

2. In ""zup walm"", 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and 'walm' follows 'zup', so 'walm' repeats the color yellow for the following outputs: Output: yellow yellow yellow.

3. In ""lug walm zup"", 'lug' corresponds to blue and is followed by 'walm', so 'walm' repeats the color blue. However, 'zup' is after 'walm', therefore it is 'zup' that changes the color sequence: Output: blue blue blue yellow.

4. Again, in ""zup walm"", the pattern holds true with 'zup' producing yellow and 'walm' repeating it: Output: yellow yellow yellow.

5. In ""dax walm lug"", 'dax' corresponds to green, followed by 'walm' which repeats the color green, and then 'lug' changes the color to blue: Output: green green green blue.

So, the rule for 'walm' is that it repeats the color of the word that is immediately before it multiple times, generally three times based on the examples provided.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue blue blue yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,True,157
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
By analyzing the given examples and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""lug.""

From the first input ""wif lug dax walm"" and output ""red blue green green green,"" we can see that ""lug"" precedes a sequence of ""green.""

Looking at the second input ""lug walm"" and output ""blue blue blue,"" it looks like ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue.""

The third input ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" and the output ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"" show that after the word ""lug,"" the colors switch to a pattern that starts with ""blue.""

The fourth input ""dax walm zup lug dax"" and the output ""green green green yellow blue green"" confirm this, where ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" and the previous color pattern is interrupted.

The last input ""lug wif bluf"" and output ""blue red red"" show again that ""lug"" stands for ""blue,"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule:
- ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue.""
- ""lug"" may also affect the subsequent pattern, notably switching the first color after ""lug"" to ""blue,"" although more examples might be necessary to confirm the exact nature of this effect.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
Input: zup dax walm -> Output: yellow green green green

From the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   (The sole word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"")

2. Input: zup dax lug wif dax
   Output: yellow green blue red green
   (The word ""wif"" is in the fourth position here and corresponds to the color ""red"")

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   (The word ""wif"" is in the second position and corresponds again to the color ""red"")

4. Input: wif
   Output: red
   (Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   (The word ""wif"" is in the second position and corresponds to ""red"")

Despite ""wif"" appearing in different positions within the sequence of words, it consistently maps to the color ""red"" regardless of its position. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: In every example, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following rules:

1. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
2. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
3. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
4. ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red"", as seen from the third example which is the only one that features these words.
5. ""walm"" appears always to repeat the word that comes immediately before it three times.

Examples to justify rule 5:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" repeats ""lug"" (blue) three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" is still translated as ""blue blue blue"", and when ""lug walm"" is repeated with an intermittent ""zup lug"", it results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"", with ""walm"" again repeating the color word (blue) three times before and after ""zup"" which is yellow.
- The third example shows ""zup walm"" as ""yellow yellow yellow"", where ""walm"" repeats ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue"", with ""walm"" repeating ""lug"" (blue) three times.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue"", so ""walm"" repeats ""wif"" (red) three times, and at the end ""lug"" is just translated as ""blue"" without a ""walm"" after it to trigger repetition.

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the preceding color word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup wif
    ",Output: blue green yellow red,blue green yellow red,True,158
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" In each example, regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the input, the output always contains ""blue."" Moreover, ""lug"" appears to be independent of any other words in the sequence since it always maps to the same color without variation.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

wif -> red
bluf -> red
lug -> blue
zup -> yellow
walm -> green green

For the word ""dax"", in every example, it always corresponds to the output ""green"". There are no instances where ""dax"" translates to any color other than green, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it.

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs:

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
Input: zup wif lug wif -> Output: yellow red blue red
Input: wif dax wif lug wif -> Output: red green red blue red

Each time the word ""wif"" appears, ""red"" appears in the output. The other words in the input seem to correspond with different colors, and there is a consistent direct mapping from the input words to the output colors.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can look at the consistent outcomes from the examples given:

1. When the input is ""dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow.""
2. When the input is ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
3. When the input is ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
4. The output for ""zup"" alone consistently results in ""yellow.""

From the above, we can see that whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output. Moreover, the word ""zup"" alone corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of whether other words are present or not.

Based on this consistent pattern, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> meaning: ""yellow"" (Rule: Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, there will be a corresponding ""yellow"" in the output.)
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to a specific color in the output. To deduce the rule for what ""bluf"" means, let's examine each instance:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   ""bluf"" in the second position corresponds to ""blue"" in the second position of the output.

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   
   Again, ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""green"" in the third position and ""yellow"" in the sixth position. However, we notice that the colors are not directly translating one-to-one to ""bluf"" across different inputs.

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug
   Output: blue blue green blue
   
   Once more, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" here, aligned with the first example.

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" since the color before and after ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red
   
   In this instance, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"". We observe that ""bluf"" becomes ""red"" when following the word ""wif.""

Given that ""bluf"" corresponds to different color outputs based on its position relative to other words, but it directly corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" and translates to ""red"" when following ""wif,"" the rule for ""bluf"" might be context-dependent with respect to the word just before it.

However, given the limited data, we might not have a comprehensive rule, but we can discern a partial pattern. Where ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it has decodable output as ""blue."" Where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" its output is ""red."" When ""bluf"" is somewhere in the middle devoid of context (without ""lug"" or ""wif"" before it), its output seems harder to predict—potentially defaulting to ""yellow"" oddly in some cases—but we can't be certain with the data provided.

Therefore, a tentative rule for ""bluf"" is:
Rule: ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and following ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Without clear context, the meaning of ""bluf"" is less predictable and may require additional context to decode.
Observing the examples:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

The output colors following the word ""walm"" match the colors that immediately precede it (for example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" means ""blue"" and it's followed by three ""blue""). This pattern holds true across all the given examples.

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,159
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"", regardless of the context in which it is used within the provided examples.
wif -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as ""red"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always includes the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Rule: ""bluf"" translates to repeating the color word that immediately precedes it. If ""wif"" means red, then ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"". If ""lug"" means blue, then ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", and so forth.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding outputs, pairing them to understand the pattern.

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
5. dax walm -> green green green

Now, let's look for patterns:

- In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""walm"" appears at the end of the input, and the output repeats the color that should be associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" is not at the end, but is followed by ""wif"" which is translated as ""red."" The color green, which precedes ""walm,"" is repeated thrice before the red, which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" appears twice, and each time, it causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated. ""zup lug walm"" results in yellow followed by blue repeated twice, and ""wif walm"" results in red repeated twice.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the word before ""walm"" should be repeated twice, and if ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, the color is repeated three times.

Rule:
walm -> meaning. When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the color is repeated three times. If not, the color is repeated twice before proceeding with the next color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,160
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Rule: lug translates to ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the rule by looking at the position and usage of the nonce word ""dax"" in different contexts:

1. When ""dax"" appears first, the output is green for the next word.
2. When ""dax"" appears anywhere else, it simply outputs green, regardless of its position or the words around it.

In all instances where ""dax"" is used, the output associated with it is green. It doesn't seem to affect the colors assigned to other words, as those remain consistent regardless of the position of ""dax"" (e.g., ""lug"" is always blue, ""wif"" is always red). The output color for ""dax"" doesn't vary based on preceding or succeeding words; it is always green.

Hence, the most probable rule is:

Rule: dax -> the output is always green regardless of its position or surrounding words.
Analyzing each example and the corresponding outputs:

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red

The rule seems to depend on the word or position before ""wif"". In examples where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", ""wif"" leads to the output ""red"". But when ""wif"" comes after ""zup"", it results in ""red"" as well, whereas after ""dax"" it leads to ""green"". So, we can infer that ""wif"" changes the color based on the previous word.

Let's attempt to break it down:

1. After ""dax"" (green) -> ""wif"" gives green.
2. After ""zup"" (yellow) -> ""wif"" gives red.
3. Standing alone before ""bluf"" -> ""wif"" gives red.
4. After ""lug"" (blue) -> ""wif"" gives red.
5. Following the pattern with ""zup"" and ""dax"" -> ""wif"" gives red and green, respectively.

Based on these examples, ""wif"" could mean ""change to the next color in a predefined sequence or based on specific rules of transition between colors"", but it's not entirely consistent. There seems to be a pattern of ""wif"" following a color word and changing the color output in a way that is not purely sequential (since ""lug"" does not precede ""wif"" with blue again).

Rule: ""wif"" changes the output color based on the previous word according to a set of transition rules: 

- After ""dax"" (green), ""wif"" results in green.
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""wif"" results in red.
- When preceding ""bluf"" or following ""lug"" (blue), ""wif"" results in red, regardless of the preceding color.

Without further context or examples, it is difficult to deduce a complete rule set for ""wif."" However, based on the given data, the above transitions seem consistent.
zup -> meaning. 

Based on the input and output examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" There is no variation in the output when the input is ""zup"" alone or when it appears in combination with other words. 

Rule: zup means ""yellow.""
By analyzing the patterns associated with the word ""bluf"" in the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to cause the next word to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Let's break down each example to observe this pattern:

1. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), the next word ""zup"" (which would have been yellow) is also red.

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the next word ""wif"" (which would have been red) turns to yellow as well.

3. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: red red yellow yellow red
   - After the first ""bluf"", ""zup"" repeats the color of the preceding word ""wif"" (red), and after the second ""bluf,"" ""wif"" repeats the color of the preceding word ""zup"" (yellow).

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - The ""bluf"" after ""lug"" (blue) leads to a repeated blue for ""wif"". Other occurrences of ""wif"" without ""bluf"" preceding return to the standard red.

5. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
   - Here we see ""bluf"" following ""lug"" (blue) causing ""wif"" to be blue instead of its typical red.

Based on these observations, I deduce the following:

bluf -> causes the next word to assume the color of the previous word.
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

Example 1: ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"". Here, 'dax' corresponds to ""green"" and 'lug' corresponds to ""blue"". 'Walm' produces ""blue blue"".

Example 2: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". From this, 'lug' is ""blue"", 'bluf' is ""blue"", and 'wif' is ""red"". 'Walm' between 'wif' and 'lug' produces ""red red red"", suggesting that 'walm' repeats the color of the word before it multiple times.

Example 3: ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". Since 'wif' is ""red"", 'walm' repeats the color ""red"" twice more.

Example 4: ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". Here, 'dax' is ""green"", 'lug' is ""blue"", 'zup' is ""yellow"", and 'wif' is ""red"". 'Walm' is inserted after 'lug' and before 'zup', which resulted in two additional instances of ""blue"".

Example 5: ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow"". 'Wif' corresponds to ""red"", 'zup' to ""yellow"", and 'walm' follows 'wif', again repeating ""red"" twice.

Considering all examples, it seems that 'walm' repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it two additional times. If this pattern holds true, 'walm' acts as an instruction to replicate the color associated with the previous word two more times.

Rule: walm repeats the color word that comes before it two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm wif
    ",Output: yellow green green green red,yellow green green green red,True,161
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's examine the instances where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue""
2. ""wif bluf lug zup"" corresponds to ""red red blue yellow""
3. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
4. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green""

Looking at these examples, let's try to find the pattern for ""lug"":

- In examples 1 and 5, it's notable that the presence of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" with ""dax"" before or after.
- In example 2, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" and it comes before ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it is followed by ""walm"" which corresponds to ""blue"" as well.
- In example 4, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and precedes ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these examples, we see a consistent pattern: the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position among other words.

Rule:
lug -> blue
To decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we must look at the correlation between its occurrences and the corresponding outputs. Below is an analysis of each example:

1. Input: ""zup dax wif""      Output: ""yellow green red""
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""

2. Input: ""dax wif lug dax""  Output: ""green red blue green""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" at the start and the end
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""

3. Input: ""dax lug""          Output: ""green blue""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""

4. Input: ""zup walm dax lug"" Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" has no direct one-to-one correlation but may be causing the repetition of ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""

5. Input: ""lug dax wif""      Output: ""blue green red""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Every time 'wif' appears in the input, the output is 'red'.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to discern the pattern and meaning associated with the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. When ""dax bluf"" appears, the output is ""green green."" This suggests that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" but only following ""dax.""

2. The second example further confirms this, as ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow red red green,"" with ""bluf"" again resulting in ""red"" after ""wif,"" but ""green"" when following ""dax.""

3. In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red,"" once again indicating ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" following ""wif.""

4. The phrase ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" yields ""yellow blue red green green red,"" showing ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" following ""dax"" before ""wif.""

5. The fifth example, ""dax bluf,"" results in ""green green,"" which is consistent with the previous observations.

Rule: 

bluf -> ""green"" when it immediately follows the word ""dax,"" and ""red"" when it immediately follows the word ""wif"". If ""bluf"" appears in other contexts not given in the examples, the rule for those contexts is not defined with the given data.
Rule: The word ""walm"" acts as a command to repeat the colors associated with the words that come before it, the number of times depending on how many unique color-associated words are present.

Explanation:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and the repetition rule applies similarly.
- ""wif lug walm"" gives ""red blue blue blue,"" which points to ""wif"" being related to the color red, and then ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times adding to red once.
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" turns into ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that ""dax"" is green, then ""lug"" (blue) once, followed by ""wif"" (red) once, ""dax"" (green) once, and finally ""zup"" (yellow) repeated 3 times as there are 3 unique color words before ""walm.""
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" indicating that after ""walm,"" any subsequent color-associated words will also follow the rule of repetition based on their position. ""Bluf"" is new and associates with the colors green and red, suggesting it might contain two colors.

Walm -> Causes repetition of the colors associated with the unique words preceding it, for as many times as there are unique color-associated words present.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, lug consistently translates to the color blue, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green' in each example.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
- Here, ""wif"" precedes ""red"" and is followed by ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""wif"" on its own results in ""red.""

Input: wif dax wif lug wif
Output: red green red blue red
- Here, ""wif"" alone once again corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green"" when it follows ""wif,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" when it follows ""wif.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- Consistent with earlier, ""wif"" produces ""red.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" and ""lug"" by ""blue.""

The rule induced from the examples is that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" every time it appears. When ""wif"" is followed by another word, that word dictates the next color in the sequence: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" There is no example that shows ""wif"" affecting the meaning of the word after it; ""wif"" always translates to ""red"" regardless of its position.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence, it always translates to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
Rule:
To determine the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze its usage and pattern within various example inputs and their corresponding outputs. Across all examples, one can observe that the outputs are names of colors which correspond to the words preceding and succeeding ""bluf.""

Let's consider the examples one by one:

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
Here, ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds with ""yellow."" This could indicate ""bluf"" takes on the color preceding it, which would be ""red"" in this case.

2. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
This example follows the same logic as the first, suggesting that ""bluf"" again takes the color of the word just before it, ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

3. wif bluf -> red red
Again, this correlation supports the rule of ""bluf"" taking the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

4. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
In this more extended sequence, ""bluf"" first follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and then later it follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Each time, ""bluf"" matches the color of the preceding word as per the pattern we are deducing.

5. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" reiterating the established pattern.

Synthesizing the information from these examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.

Therefore, the deduced rule is:
bluf -> takes the color of the previous word
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs. Let's analyze each input-output pair and look for occurrences of ""walm.""

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" does not appear in other examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to two ""yellow"" before ""walm.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""yellow.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" with ""walm"" occurring after these.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Observations:
1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, it results in repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
2. ""walm"" has followed different words (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif""), and in each case, it repeats the color output of the word before it.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it, specifically repeating the color three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,163
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" is part of the output sequence corresponding to the position of ""dax"".
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for a pattern in each example provided. Let's evaluate each input and its corresponding output to identify the pattern related to the use of ""wif.""

1. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf | Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
3. Input: zup walm lug wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
4. Input: zup dax wif | Output: yellow green red
5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup | Output: blue red green green green yellow

From reviewing these examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently triggers the output of ""red."" Additionally, it seems that other words in input affect the color output before ""wif"" appears. Each of the other words correlates with a specific color - ""dax"" correlates with green, ""lug"" correlates with blue, and ""zup"" correlates with yellow. After ""wif,"" the color pattern resumes according to the words that follow.

Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears. Every single input that contains the word ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" being in the output. Other words in the input correspond to other colors in the output: for instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of bluf, let's look at the relationship between the input and the output in the given examples:

1. Input: wif bluf dax 
   Output: red red green

2. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

3. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow

Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example, the word ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
  - Since ""bluf"" is in the middle and the output is ""red red green,"" this suggests that ""bluf"" may assume the color preceding it, meaning ""bluf"" would be ""red"" in this context.

- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds again with ""red.""
  - Here ""bluf"" is at the end, and the output is ""blue red blue blue,"" once again suggesting that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word right before it, which would be ""blue.""

- The third example shows ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""
  - With ""bluf"" at the end and the output being ""yellow blue blue,"" it further supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word, hence ""blue"" here.

- The fourth example again shows ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""dax"" as ""green.""
  - With ""bluf"" at the end and the output is ""blue green green,"" this reinforces that ""bluf"" matches the color of the word before it, ""green"" in this case.

- The fifth example has ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""lug"" as ""blue,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""
  - With ""bluf"" at the end and the output being ""red blue yellow yellow,"" it further substantiates that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, making ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow"" here.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the word preceding it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> assumes the color of the preceding word in the input sequence.
Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. 

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" means ""red red red"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" means ""green green green"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" at the end, and since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" is ""red red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" is ""green green green"".

Thus,

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm zup
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue blue yellow,yellow green blue blue blue yellow,False,164
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"". Independent of its position in the sequence, ""lug"" always results in the output ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern in which the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Input: ""dax wif zup"" -> Output: ""green red yellow""
Input: ""lug dax"" -> Output: ""blue green""
Input: ""dax zup wif"" -> Output: ""green yellow red""
Input: ""wif walm dax"" -> Output: ""red red red green""

As ""dax"" maintains its association with ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence, it seems reasonable to conclude that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Each time the word 'wif' appears in the input, the word 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output.
zup -> meaning. Meaning: zup translates into the color ""yellow"".

Rule: Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is replaced by ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the rule for ""bluf"". To do this, we must look for patterns that correlate the input and output across all the examples.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Let's examine the outputs whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". This happened twice, suggesting consistency.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", with ""wif"" coming before ""dax"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" is the final word in the series, even if ""dax"" comes before it, the output is simply a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"".
- In a longer sequence, ""bluf"" leads to the output ""red"", when it is preceded by both ""wif"" and ""dax"". But when ""dax"" appears after ""bluf"", the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) follows.

From these observations, we might infer:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color output of the word before it. However, when ""bluf"" is preceded by both ""wif"" and ""dax"" specifically, it seems to output ""red"". Without more context, this pattern is somewhat ambiguous, as there is only one instance of ""bluf"" following both ""wif"" and ""dax"". To confirm the rule for ""bluf"", more examples would be helpful, especially ones that further clarify its relationship with ""wif"" and ""dax"" together.

Given the examples, a tentative rule could be: bluf -> repeat the preceding color, with a possible exception or special rule when preceded by ""wif dax"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" affects the color output by extending the quantity of the preceding color output. The rule seems to be that the color before ""walm"" is repeated thrice instead of being said once.

Let's review the examples:

- ""dax walm wif walm"" yields ""green green green red red red"", where ""green"" corresponds to ""dax"", and ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"". Both colors are tripled due to the presence of ""walm"" after each.

- ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red"", where ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup"" and ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"" again, tripled because of ""walm"".

- ""lug dax walm"" yields ""blue green green green"", where ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"" and ""green"" corresponds to ""dax"", which is tripled due to ""walm"".

- ""zup wif walm"" is provided twice and consistently yields ""yellow red red red,"" adhering to the same pattern as outlined above.

- ""wif dax zup walm"" yields ""red green yellow yellow yellow"", where the pattern continues except that ""walm"" comes at the end, tripling only the output corresponding to ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it triples the color output that immediately precedes it.

Walm -> meaning. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color corresponding to that word is outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,165
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning is the color blue.

Rule: Whenever the word lug appears in the input, it corresponds to the color blue in the output.
To determine the meaning of dax, we will look at the input and output pairs to discern a pattern.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- The word dax corresponds to green and wif corresponds to red.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
- Here, dax still corresponds to green. The new word zup corresponds to yellow, lug corresponds to blue, and wif still corresponds to red.

Input: dax zup dax zup
Output: green yellow green yellow
- The word dax corresponds to green and zup still corresponds to yellow, reaffirming our previous findings.

Input: dax
Output: green
- When dax is on its own, the output is simply green, reaffirming that dax corresponds to green.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- dax corresponds to green at the beginning and the end. Wif still corresponds to red. It's not clear what walm means from this example alone. However, it seems like walm might result in the repetition of the previous color, which in this case is green.

From these observations, it is clear that dax corresponds to the color green, regardless of the context it is used in. Other words in the input correspond to other colors, and the pattern of colors corresponds to the order of words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" based on the given examples.
To understand the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs.

First observation:
- Input: wif zup
- Output: red yellow

In this instance, ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow."" There is no context other than the single occurrence of each, so we infer ""zup"" to mean ""yellow.""

However, let's consider more examples to see if this holds.

Second observation from additional examples:
- Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
- Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Here we see ""wif"" is consistently mapping to ""red,"" and ""zup"" is consistently followed by ""yellow"" in the output regardless of what follows or precedes it.

Third observation:
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
- Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Once again, ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

Similar patterns occur in the fourth and fifth examples, with ""zup"" reliably mapping to ""yellow.""

Rule:
zup -> ""yellow""

Meaning:
zup means ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples provided:

- ""zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
- ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""
- ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green""
- ""lug wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue blue""

Based on the provided data:

- Whenever we see ""bluf"" at the end of a sequence, the output is the color before it, repeated once.
- If ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" could mean to repeat the previous color mentioned.
- In the longest provided sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" with the output being ""green red."" This is a deviation since it's not just ""green"" repeated.
- The preceding rule is somewhat contradicted by the ""wif bluf dax"" example, where the output for ""bluf dax"" is ""red green,"" breaking the pattern of ""bluf"" causing a repeat of the previous color.

Given this information, a potential rule for ""bluf"" is that it typically signifies a repetition of the previous color word in the sequence. However, there’s an irregularity in the sequence involving ""dax,"" which suggests that either ""dax"" influences ""bluf"" in an unconventional manner or there may be an error in the input-output relationship.

Based on the majority of consistent observations, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color mentioned in the sequence (with the possible exception of ""dax"" influencing this rule).
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated color of the word it follows. Examining each line:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" causes the next instances of color to repeat that same color (""red"") until a new word/color (""dax"") is introduced.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" extends this color.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" replicates that color.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" extends the ""blue"" color.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" replicates that color.

walm -> meaning. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to repeat the corresponding color of that word for the span of output that follows, until a new word/color appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,166
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine each of the input-output pairs to identify any consistent patterns.

1. Input: wif
   Output: red

In this first example, ""wif"" corresponds directly to the word ""red.""

2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

Here, ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

In the third example, ""wif"" appears at the start and still corresponds to ""red."" Following ""wif,"" the word ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The pattern for ""wif"" remains consistent.

4. Input: wif
   Output: red

Once more, ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red,"" so the pattern is unchanged.

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

In this final example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue."" It's notable that ""walm"" corresponded to ""red"" in a previous example but to ""blue"" in this one; this suggests that the meaning of ""walm"" and other words might be context-dependent. However, the meaning of ""wif"" has consistently been ""red,"" irrespective of its position.

Based on these examples and the consistent representation of the color ""red"" whenever the word ""wif"" appears, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule is irrespective of the context in which ""wif"" appears; it always corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it is used.
Based on the examples provided, bluf appears to repeat the color word that preceded it in the sequence. Here's how the pattern matches each example:

- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"" (bluf repeats ""lug"", which means blue).
- ""zup wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow red red"" (bluf repeats ""wif"", which means red).
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" becomes ""red red blue green red"" (bluf repeats ""wif"", which means red).
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" becomes ""red blue yellow yellow"" (bluf repeats ""zup"", which means yellow).
- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"" (bluf repeats ""dax"", which means green).

So the rule for bluf seems to be to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Observing the given examples, we can establish a correlation between the nonce word 'walm' and the outputs that follow after:

1. ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue"". We observe that 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'. The appearance of 'walm' leads to three instances of 'blue'.

2. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" outputs ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red"". 'Lug' translates to 'blue', and 'wif' translates to 'red'. Following 'walm', there is a repetition of the color immediately before it. First 'walm' has 'lug' before it and there are three 'blue' after, second 'walm' has 'zup' before it leading to three 'yellow'.

3. ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here 'walm' follows 'zup' (yellow) and precedes the repetition of three 'yellow'.

4. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Here 'walm' follows 'lug' (blue) and produces three 'blue' in the output.

5. ""zup walm lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". 'Walm' follows 'zup' (yellow) resulting in three 'yellow' before 'lug' translates to 'blue'.

From these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the color word immediately before it to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,167
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" is included in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that specific words correspond to specific colors. Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

1. ""wif zup lug zup lug"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue yellow blue""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
3. ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow""
4. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow red green""
5. ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green""

From these examples, we can infer that specific nonce words directly translate to certain colors:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""

Given that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the fourth example, it seems that ""bluf"" may be synonymous with ""zup,"" or there was an inconsistency/mistake in that particular example.

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze how it is used across different examples and the corresponding outputs.

In the first input, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif dax walm"" and the output is ""yellow red green green green."" This suggests that ""zup"" could translate to ""yellow,"" but we need more evidence.

Looking at the second input, ""dax bluf wif zup,"" the output is ""green green red yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is at the end, and the corresponding output ends with ""yellow,"" giving further credence to ""zup"" meaning ""yellow.""

In the third input, ""zup wif lug wif,"" the output is ""yellow red blue red."" The first word of the output is ""yellow,"" matching the position of ""zup"" in the input.

In the fourth input, ""wif zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""red yellow green green."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" the output is ""yellow blue red green green red,"" and ""zup"" is the first word, which is aligned with ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on these observations across all the examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correspond with a pair of colors in sequence. Looking more closely at the examples:

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to a pair of ""yellow"" colors following ""zup.""

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- ""bluf"" corresponds to a pair of ""red"" colors following ""wif.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- Here ""bluf"" again corresponds to a pair of ""red"" colors following ""wif,"" but before ""dax"" and ""walm.""

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- ""bluf"" corresponds to a pair of ""blue"" colors following ""lug.""

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
- Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to a pair of ""red"" colors, this time following ""wif.""

To synthesize the rule from these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" results in the output of a pair of colors. The color that is duplicated seems to be the one that directly precedes ""bluf"" in each case. Therefore, the rule of ""bluf"" could be described as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes ""bluf"" twice in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the outputs corresponding to the different inputs, focusing on when ""walm"" is present and how the outputs change.

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
2. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
5. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""

From the inputs and outputs, we can deduce:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Now, let's examine the effect of ""walm"" on the outputs.

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output repeats ""red"" three times.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output repeats ""blue"" three times before continuing with the pattern for ""wif dax.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output repeats ""green"" three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" and the output repeats ""yellow"" three times before continuing with the pattern for ""lug.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" is at the end again, following ""zup,"" and the output repeats ""yellow"" three times.

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated three times in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,168
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position or the other words present in the inputs.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at the position of the word in the input and its corresponding output color. It is important to notice sequences or patterns that may help identify a rule. Let's analyze the examples given and see if there's a pattern associated with ""dax"":

- Example 1: dax bluf -> green green
- Example 2: zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
- Example 3: dax lug dax wif dax -> green blue green red green
- Example 4: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
- Example 5: zup dax -> yellow green

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is in the output. The position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to affect its corresponding color in the output as it changes position but always maps to ""green."" There is no evident dependency on the surrounding words either, as ""dax"" follows and precedes different words but still results in ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. The appearance of the word ""dax"" in the input always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position or surrounding context.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that each unique word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output. Comparing the inputs and outputs provided:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
2. ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
4. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Noticing that ""walm"" and ""dax"" both correspond to ""green"", we can see that these are not part of the rule for ""wif"" specifically. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In each input, regardless of the other words present or their order, ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
From the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- ""lug bluf zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue yellow blue""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" translates to ""red red yellow red blue green""
- ""dax bluf"" translates once again to ""green green""

Based on the examples, the first word seems to determine the color, and the word ""bluf"" is repeated as the same color as the first word. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" but ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it. For lug it's blue, for dax it's green, for wif it’s red.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that precedes it.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in the output of the color associated with the preceding word repeated one extra time beyond the first instance. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red. When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color output is repeated an additional time.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in all given examples.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" This rule is consistent across all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. This is observed in every example where ""bluf"" follows another word whose output is a color, and the output color is then repeated for ""bluf."" Below are the specific observations that support this:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" which means ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" outputs ""red red red blue blue,"" showing that the color associated with ""lug"" is repeated by ""bluf.""
- The fourth example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" outputs ""yellow red green red red,"" and ""bluf"" is duplicating the color of the word right before it ""wif,"" which has been associated with ""red.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" the output ""green green yellow yellow green,"" shows that ""bluf"" is indeed repeating the colors from the preceding words.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: repeats the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll analyze the patterns present in the given examples.

Looking at the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color ""blue."" It doesn't represent a single instance of the color but rather a repetition.

Let's examine each instance:

1. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
   Here, ""walm"" generates the color green twice after ""dax"" which is initially translated as green.

2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   Again, ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue repeated twice after ""lug"" which is initially translated as blue.

3. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   ""walm"" generates the color blue twice following the initial ""lug"" translated as blue.

4. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
   ""walm"" results in the color green being repeated twice after the original color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.

5. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   In this final example, ""walm"" extends the blue color twice after ""lug.""

Rule:

""walm"" -> repetition of the color indicated by the previous word, occurring twice more than the initial occurrence. If the previous word is ""lug,"" and ""lug"" represents blue, then ""walm"" following ""lug"" would represent blue repeated twice more, giving a total of three instances of blue in a row. If ""dax"" is preceding ""walm"" and ""dax"" is initially green, then ""walm"" would represent green repeated twice more, totaling three instances of green in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax zup wif walm
    ",Output: yellow green yellow red red red,yellow green yellow red red red,True,170
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with a specific color output every time it is used. As such, we can deduce that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:
dax -> green

Each example confirms this:

- When the input is only ""dax"", the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" or ""zup,"" the color order follows the pattern but ""dax"" remains ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is repeated, as in ""dax lug dax wif dax,"" it consistently translates to ""green"" with other words switching to their corresponding colors.

These consistent associations across different contexts suggest that ""dax"" specifically means ""green,"" independent of its position or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" also to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""walm"" to red, and ""wif"" to red as well. There is a direct mapping between each nonce word and a color output that repeats consistently across examples.

Hence, the rule is: wif corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Every occurrence of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it translates to the color that immediately preceded it.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which translates to blue), therefore ""bluf"" translates to blue.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which translates to green) and ""zup"" (which translates to yellow), and in both instances, ""bluf"" translates to the color that came before it.
- The third example shows that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it translates to red, just like ""wif"".
- Similarly, in the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to green; just like ""dax"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" again translates to the color of the preceding word, which is blue (from ""lug"").

Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to change the color output to a sequence of the same color as the word that precedes ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

1. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" follows both ""dax"" and ""walm.""

2. dax walm -> green green green
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" follows both.

3. wif walm -> red red red
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" follows both.

4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""yellow"" follows both.

5. dax wif walm -> green red red red
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" follows both.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated for the number of times ""walm"" would dictate.

walm -> turns the output into a sequence of the same color based on the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif dax lug bluf zup
    ",Output: yellow red green blue blue yellow,yellow red green blue blue yellow,True,171
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" I'll compare the inputs and outputs for patterns:

- When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" appears in various positions and does not seem to correspond to a single color.
- ""lug"" precedes the output color that corresponds to the following word (based on the first and second examples).

Looking at each instance where ""lug"" appears, let's see how it maps:

- ""wif lug zup"" maps to ""red blue yellow."" Since we know ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" in this case looks like it mapped to ""blue.""
- ""zup lug dax"" maps to ""yellow blue green."" Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and we can hypothesize that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""lug"" again looks like it corresponded to ""blue.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" maps to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" It's a bit more complex. We recognize ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""lug"" prempting ""walm"" where the output is ""blue blue blue"" suggests ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""blue,"" and that ""lug"" didn't directly translate to any of those colors.
- ""lug wif zup wif"" maps to ""blue red yellow red,"" suggesting that after ""lug,"" it followed the pattern of the color corresponding to ""wif"" which is ""red,"" thus giving ""blue"" again.
- ""lug zup wif zup"" maps to ""blue yellow red yellow."" This also follows the pattern where ""lug"" precedes ""blue,"" and the rest follows the color coding of the corresponding words.

Based on the patterns in these five examples, ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue"" no matter its position in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding output, focusing on the position of ""dax"" and the color that it translates to:

1. Input: zup dax lug wif dax
   Output: yellow green blue red green
   
2. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   
3. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   
4. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   
5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Looking at the position of ""dax"" and the corresponding color in the output, it appears that ""dax"" always translates to ""green."" Hence, the meaning of ""dax"" can be inferred as ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the input-output pairs presented, it can be observed that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red' in every instance where it appears. Thus, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Analyzing the given examples, we are trying to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's examine the pattern of color outputs associated with this word and its surrounding context.

1. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   
2. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red
   
3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   
4. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   
5. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

Noticing the outputs, whenever ""bluf"" appears:

- It is always followed by ""red"" in the output, no matter what other word precedes it.
- The color that precedes ""red"" seems to depend on the word immediately before ""bluf"" and not on ""bluf"" itself.
- In cases where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is always ""red red.""
- In cases where ""bluf"" is at the end of the input, it results in a single ""red"" in the output.

Given this analysis, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with the output color ""red."" Moreover, ""bluf"" does not appear to change the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> red
To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's first examine the consistent patterns in the provided examples. 

From the first input-output pair:
- ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow""
- Here, ""wif"" results in ""red"" and ""zup"" in ""yellow""

From the second input-output pair:
- ""wif dax lug walm"" leads to ""red green blue blue blue""
- We know ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue""

Analyzing the third input-output pair:
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow"", ""wif"" produces ""red"", and ""lug"" produces ""blue""

Looking at the fourth input-output pair:
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" corresponds with ""green green green yellow blue green""
- ""dax"" results in ""green"", ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", and ""lug"" results in ""blue""

And finally, with the fifth input-output pair:
- ""dax walm wif"" gives us ""green green green red""
- ""dax"" gives ""green"", and ""wif"" gives ""red""

Now, let's look specifically at ""walm"" across the examples:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" it leads to repeated ""red"", which means it might repeat the color of the word before it.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" it leads to repeated ""blue"", which again, might suggest it is taking on the color of the preceding word.
3. In the only instance where ""walm"" doesn't immediately follow another color-associated word (""zup wif lug zup walm""), it still results in a repetition, which is of the color yellow that was just referenced by the word ""zup"".

In every case, ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, ""walm"" appears to be a repeater of sorts.

Rule:
Walm -> meaning. Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,172
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue"" in the outputs. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the sentence. Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" and how it correlates with the color output. Let's analyze the examples:

- Input: dax
  Output: green
  This input/output tells us that the word ""dax"" alone translates to the color green.

- Input: dax wif walm
  Output: green red red red
  ""Dax"" here is again green, but now we have ""wif"" and ""walm"" both producing red outputs.

- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
  Output: green green green red blue green green green
  In this example, it's clear that ""dax"" continues to produce green, but ""lug"" now correlates with blue. Since ""dax walm"" produces ""green green"", this might suggest that ""walm"" repeats the previous color. This is supported by the last ""walm"" also resulting in a repetition of green. ""Wif"" appears again, but here it precedes a red and a blue, being positioned before ""lug."" It's possible ""wif"" induces a repetition/continuation of the previous color, not necessarily red as initially thought.

- Input: dax
  Output: green
  Again, ""dax"" on its own consistently translates to green.

- Input: zup dax lug dax
  Output: yellow green blue green
  Here, ""dax"" is green where it appears, ""lug"" is blue, and we see a new word ""zup"" which correlates to yellow.

The most consistent rule we can deduce from these examples is that ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following correlations:

- ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"".
- ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" only appears once, and in that instance, it corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" only appears once, and in that instance, it corresponds to ""green"".

It should be noted that ""walm"" translating to ""blue"" might not be definitive because it only has one occurrence. There could be other rules at play that aren't apparent from the single instance.

Considering only the consistent translations, we can formulate the following rules:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: dax -> green

""Rule"" here simply means the consistent substitution of one word for another across different examples.
Analyzing the examples provided:

- When 'dax' precedes 'zup', the output is green and then yellow.
- When 'zup' precedes 'bluf', the output is yellow followed by yellow.
- When 'zup' precedes 'wif', the output is yellow followed by red.
- When 'wif' precedes 'zup', the output is red and then yellow.
- When 'lug' surrounds 'zup' or follows 'zup', the output is blue, yellow, and blue, respectively.

From the above patterns, 'zup' consistently translates to yellow irrespective of preceding or following words. Thus, the word 'zup' does not change meaning based on context; it always corresponds to the color yellow in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word preceding it.

Rule: Whatever color is associated with the word that comes immediately before bluf, bluf takes on that same color. For instance, if the word before bluf is 'wif' which outputs 'red', then 'bluf' following it will also output 'red'.
To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- Here, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red."" After ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Here, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" which is then repeated three times after ""walm,"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" which is repeated three times after ""walm,"" followed by ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- Here, we see that ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" lead to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow"" respectively. Post ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"" is repeated three times before the sequence continues normally.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, we do not have a translation for ""bluf"" directly, but we can infer ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""blue"" for ""lug,"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup."" After ""walm,"" the color of ""yellow"" associated with the preceding ""zup"" is repeated three times.

From these inputs and outputs, we can deduce that ""walm"" is an operation that repeats the color word preceding it three times in the output. Based on these examples, the rule seems consistent regardless of what the preceding color word is, so we will generalize this rule rather than assign ""walm"" a single color meaning.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green green green green,blue red green green green,False,173
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided information, we are trying to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" from the context of a series of examples. Each example consists of an input of nonce words and an output that translates those nonce words into colors. Let's analyze the examples and see what correlates with ""lug"":

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

Here, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and ""walm"" correlates with blue. Since we have ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" it indicates that ""lug"" also translates to blue.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

In this example, ""dax"" correlates with green and ""zup"" with yellow. The word ""wif"" correlates with red. Since ""lug"" appears twice and the output has blue twice, this backs up our earlier observation that ""lug"" correlates with blue.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Here, both instances of ""dax"" correlate with green, ""walm"" correlates with green which differs from the first example but could be context-dependent, and ""zup"" correlates with yellow. Since ""lug"" occurs once and the output shows a single blue, this is consistent with our understanding that ""lug"" means blue.

Input: zup dax zup lug
Output: yellow green yellow blue

The pattern here is straightforward. ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, followed by another ""zup"" meaning yellow, and ""lug"" follows, meaning the output is blue.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Once again, ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" and ""walm"" are red based on this example (even though ""walm"" correlated with blue in the first example), and ""zup"" is yellow. ""lug"" is immediately before ""zup"" and correlates with blue.

From all the examples, we can confidently deduce that ""lug"" consistently correlates with the color blue regardless of its position among the other nonce words. Therefore:

lug -> meaning. Rule: ""lug"" means blue.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for 'dax' seems to be that it translates to the color 'green'. Each time 'dax' is mentioned in the input, the color 'green' appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we are trying to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"". Let's look at each example and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - This suggests that ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red"".

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - Here ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" seems to be repeated as ""red"" three times. The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"".

3. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""zup walm"" at the end replicates the ""yellow"" followed by three ""red"" (though here they appear as yellow). ""lug"" and ""dax"" may correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively, or vice versa.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""walm"" again results in ""red"" repeated. ""zup"" is ""yellow"". The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well.

5. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
   - ""wif"" is ""red"", reinforcing that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

From these examples, the rule seems to be:
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- Other words have their own color associations but ""wif"" consistently means ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, while other words correspond to different colors.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze the position where it occurs in each example and the corresponding output.

1. In the first example, the output sequence has the color ""yellow"" repeated twice at the position of ""bluf."" Prior to ""bluf,"" the pattern is ""yellow blue.""
   Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" results in ""red red,"" which is the output color repeated twice. Before ""bluf,"" the pattern is ""yellow green.""
   Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

3. The third example shows ""bluf"" resulting in ""red red,"" a repetition of the color ""green."" Again, this is seen as a color repetition.
   Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

4. In the fourth example, the sole occurrence of ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" with the color ""yellow"" being repeated.
   Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

5. The fifth example has ""bluf"" occurring twice and both times it's translated to a double occurrence of the color indicated previously that is ""blue"" and then ""yellow.""
   Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

Rule:
From these examples, we infer that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color word immediately before its occurrence. If no color word appears before ""bluf,"" the color yellow is repeated, as seen in the fourth example.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the previous color word twice. If there is no previous color, repeat ""yellow"" twice.
Based on the given examples, we can see a pattern regarding the word ""walm"" and the associated colors in the output. Essentially, for every occurrence of the word ""walm,"" a sequence of repeating colors is generated in the output. The color that repeats is determined by the word that directly precedes ""walm."" To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe the color that precedes it and the sequence that follows it in the output. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and we see a repetition of ""blue"" in the output.

2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated after it.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Here, ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm"" generating a sequence of ""blue."" The word ""wif"" precedes the second ""walm,"" resulting in a sequence of ""red.""

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" resulting in a sequence of ""red.""

Therefore, ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color output corresponding to the immediately preceding word the same number of times as there have been unique words since the last ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output that corresponds to the word preceding ""walm"", as many times as there have been unique words since the last ""walm"" (or since the start if it's the first ""walm"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,174
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the information provided in the examples, we can analyze the pattern of words and their corresponding colors to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Let's look at the appearances of ""dax"" and what color is output each time:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

3. Input: dax lug dax wif dax
   Output: green blue green red green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" every time it appears

4. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

5. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Across all examples, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is consistently ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word has a corresponding color output:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue (this is inferred since 'lug' also maps to blue)

The rules for the sequence appears to be that each input nonce word is mapped to a specific color in the output, maintaining the same order as the input. Therefore, the rule for the word 'wif' consistently results in the output 'red' regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Comparing each line of the input and the associated output, I notice a consistent pattern in which each given word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Here's the breakdown of what each word translates to based on the available data:

- ""walm"" and ""lug"" always result in ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively, whenever they appear in the input.
- ""dax"" is consistently linked to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color ""red.""

Given this pattern, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" as it consistently results in ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
The examples show the word ""bluf"" being translated into ""red"" or ""green"" dependent on the context. Let's examine the patterns where ""bluf"" appears:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" it translates to ""blue"".
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" it translates to ""red"".
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" it translates to ""green"".

Given these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the provided examples and the outputs associated with them. Let's analyze each one:

1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   We notice that the word ""walm"" appears at the end and produces three instances of 'blue'.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by 'zup' and 'lug' before another 'dax', and we have three instances of 'green' at the more beginning.

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   ""Walm"" appears twice in this input. The first ""walm"" is preceded by two 'blue' and followed by 'zup' which gives 'yellow', whereas the second ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug walm zup"" and followed by a red 'wif', giving us three yellows.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" is preceded by 'zup' which is associated with the color yellow, and there are three 'yellow', one for 'zup' and two for 'walm'. 

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" follows 'dax' and 'lug', which correspond to 'green' and 'blue', and it results in two additional blues.

Looking at these examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in multiple instances of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. To be more precise, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it two additional times resulting in three of the same color consecutively. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""Repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,175
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue."" This is supported by the consistent mapping in each example where ""lug"" is present.

Rule: lug -> blue
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to examine the inputs and outputs where ""dax"" is used and look for a consistent pattern. The appearance of ""dax"" should correspond to a specific color in the output. 

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green
""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in this sequence.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
Here, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is repeated in the output as ""green green"".

3. Input: lug dax zup dax wif -> Output: blue green yellow green red
Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the output follows the order of inputs.

4. Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Once more, ""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

5. Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
""Dax"" is the first word and corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sentence. The rule appears to be that each word is associated with a specific color, with ""dax"" always being associated with ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Let's validate this hypothesis by examining each line of input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" is unknown, but it appears to also correspond to ""red.""

3. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax lug
   Output: red green blue
   - Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - Lastly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

In every example, ""wif"" is consistent with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the inputs and correlating them with the outputs provided, the first step is to identify patterns related to the word ""zup"" and the corresponding output ""yellow"". In each case where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the output. To validate this, we should consider all occurrences:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here the word ""walm"" doesn't seem to correspond to the word ""yellow,"" as the output is just repeated yellows without additional context for ""walm"".
- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" results in ""yellow red red yellow blue"". The second ""zup"" produces a ""yellow"" again towards the end of the sequence.
- ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" creates ""yellow red green red red"". In this case, ""zup"" is the first word and correlates with the first ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""lug dax zup"" turns into ""blue green yellow"", with ""zup"" accounting for the last ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green"". Again, ""zup"" is associated with the initial ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can conclude that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". It does not appear to change based on position or the presence of other words. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates into the color that precedes it. Here is the evidence supporting this deduction:

1. In the first input, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"".

2. In the second input, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow green yellow green red red"". This pattern indicates that ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""wif,"" which is ""red"".

3. In the third input, ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" equates to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" follows suit.

4. The fourth input, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", produces the output ""red red green green red red red blue red"". Here ""bluf"" becomes ""red"" after ""wif"" and ""green"" after ""dax"".

5. Finally, the fifth input, ""dax bluf zup"", corresponds to ""green green yellow"" in the output, which also supports the rule where ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color value of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns and the positional context of the word in each input in relation to the outputs.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Walm seems to be related to yellow since zup is followed by three yellows.

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- Walm is followed by three blues, zup by one yellow, and wif by one red. Lug precedes walm and results in blue before walm's color repetition.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- Walm is seen to produce three repetition of the previous color, which is green, and then changes to red after wif.

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- Walm repeats the blue, as seen in other examples.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- Walm again causes repetition of the previous color, which is blue in this case.

Rule:
Walm -> Causes the repetition of the previous color thrice. If the 'walm' is preceded by 'dax', 'lug', or 'zup', it repeats the corresponding color thrice (green for 'dax', blue for 'lug', and yellow for 'zup'). If preceded by 'wif', the pattern is interrupted and followed by red (as seen in the third input), but this rule cannot be confirmed for the case of wif as there is only one example.

So the meaning of walm could be expressed as: walm -> Repeat the previous color thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,176
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears on its own, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" is combined with other words (""dax"", ""walm"", ""zup"", ""wif""), it still translates to ""blue"".
- The other words (""dax"", ""walm"", ""zup"", ""wif"") consistently translate to other colors regardless of their position relative to ""lug"".

With these observations, we can conclude the rule for ""lug"" is:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Analyzing the sequence of inputs and their corresponding outputs, I will deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax"".

- In the first example, ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red"". The word ""lug"" appears multiple times across examples and always translates to ""blue"". Similarly, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" to ""red"" as well, given that it does not change between examples where ""walm"" is present. Therefore, it suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", as it is the only new element in the sequence that translates to the only new color in the output.

- In the second example, ""lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""blue green blue"". This reinforces the idea that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and since the second word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", this is consistent with the rule deduced from the first example.

- The third example, ""lug wif dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue red green red"". This continues to support the idea that ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""dax"" falls in the position where ""green"" appears in the output.

- In the fourth example, ""zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red green"". Here, ""wif"" is consistent with being ""red"", and ""dax"" again aligns with the output ""green"". We also see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

- The fifth example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". ""Lug"" and ""wif"" maintain their associated colors, ""blue"" and ""red"", respectively, and ""zup"" is again linked to ""yellow"". Given that ""walm"" after ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"", and considering previous rules, it seems that ""walm"" changes to ""yellow"" only after ""zup"". The new word “dax” occurs in the position of ""green"" which further supports the previous observations.

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule for ""dax"" is consistent:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color pattern in the output. By examining the frequency and placement of the word ""wif"" and its corresponding color in the output, we can try to induce the rule.

Here are the examples with a focus on instances of ""wif"" and their immediate color correspondences:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

- ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output.

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

- ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" following three ""green"" from the words ""dax walm.""

Input: wif
Output: red

- ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax wif lug
Output: green red blue

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" following ""green"" from ""dax.""

From these examples, we can see that regardless of what comes before or after, ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red."" There is no variation in the output color based on the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence. Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

So the induction for the meaning of ""wif"" is:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" from the given examples, consider each instance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. wif dax bluf -> red green green
5. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue

From these examples, it's apparent that every time ""bluf"" appears, the word that immediately precedes it has the same color output as ""bluf"". This would imply that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word before it. Specifically:

- In examples 1 and 4, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are red.
- In example 3, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are blue.
- In example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are blue again.
- Example 2 demonstrates that when ""bluf"" is the last word, its color is the previous word's color, yellow in this case (even though ""bluf"" does not directly follow ""zup"", the last unique word it follows is ""zup"").

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, walm seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it:

- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- lug walm -> blue blue blue
- wif walm -> red red red

When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is three instances of the color that represents the word in the sequence before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the prior word, three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug
    ",Output: red red red blue,red red red blue,True,177
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" No matter its position in the sequence or the presence of other words, ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" in the output. The usage of ""lug"" does not appear to depend on any context or other words around it. Therefore, the rule for what ""lug"" means in this context is simply:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" To illustrate, every instance of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the other words around it. As such, the rule can be determined as follows:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the given examples, each input word corresponds to a unique color in the output. When examining the outputs corresponding to the input that contains the word ""wif,"" the first output color is consistently red, regardless of the word that follows it.

Here are the observed correspondences for the other words based on the inputs and outputs given:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow

Now, let's apply this to determine the meaning of ""wif"":

- In the first example, ""lug dax walm wif"" leads to ""blue green green green red."" We can see that lug, dax, and walm correspond to blue and green as determined earlier, and wif's presence results in the color red at the end of the output sequence.
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" leads to ""green green green red red."" Again, dax and walm correspond to green and wif is followed by red, which is also the output for bluf.
- In the third example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" leads to ""red blue blue red yellow."" Here, wif corresponds to red both times it is used, preceding other colors.
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax"" results in ""red green."" Wif corresponds to red and dax to green.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup"" leads to ""red yellow."" Wif corresponds to red and zup to yellow.

Given these observations, we can deduce the meaning of wif:

Rule: wif corresponds to the color red. 

So, wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position within the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the inputs and outputs closely:

- When ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" is provided as input, the output is ""red red blue green red."" Notably, the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and by looking at the pattern, it seems ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

- ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow,"" pointing to the word ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

- In the input ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" the output ""yellow red red yellow blue"" correlates with ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The two occurrences of ""red"" suggest that ""bluf"" might also mean ""red.""

- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" again indicating that ""bluf"" could mean ""red.""

- Finally, in the input ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" The word ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The additional word ""walm"" also maps to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" precedes a sequence of ""red red,"" it's reasonable to infer it also means ""red.""

Based on these patterns, we can induce the rule that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples and see how ""walm"" influences the output.

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   In this example, the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif""; ""dax"" leads to a ""green"" output and ""wif"" to ""red"" output. ""Walm"" seems to triple the output associated with the word that precedes it.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""zup"" precedes the first ""walm,"" and the output is three ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" before the second ""walm"" yields three ""red"" again. So ""walm"" is tripling the output colors.

3. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   The pattern holds: ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in three ""blue.""

4. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   We see the same rule applicable: the last word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" leading to three ""red.""

5. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   Consistent with previous observations, ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in three ""green.""

Based on this analysis, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that precedes it three times.

Rule:
walm -> Tripling the output color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,178
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To induce the rule for what ""lug"" means in the provided context, we need to examine the patterns and relationships between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here are the steps to deduce the rule:

1. Analyze each example individually:
    - When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue.""
    - When ""lug"" is combined with other words, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the other words have their outputs, such as ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

2. Check for consistency across examples:
    - The output for ""lug"" is consistently ""blue"" in every example, regardless of the other words present. 

3. Formulate a hypothesis:
    - It appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

4. Test the hypothesis with all examples:
    - Input: ""lug"" / Output: ""blue"" (consistent)
    - Input: ""lug"" / Output: ""blue"" (consistent)
    - Input: ""wif lug"" / Output: ""red blue"" (""wif"" appears to be ""red,"" confirming ""lug"" is ""blue"")
    - Input: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" / Output: ""yellow red green green green blue"" 
      (Other words have distinct outputs, but ""lug"" remains ""blue"")
    - Input: ""lug wif lug"" / Output: ""blue red blue"" (Here, ""lug"" appears twice, outputting ""blue"" each time, and ""wif"" outputs ""red"")

Rule:
Since ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all provided examples, we can conclude the following rule:

lug -> meaning. Meaning: ""lug"" means ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" from given examples, let's look at the relationship between the output (colors) and the input (words sequence), focusing on the occurrences of ""dax."" 

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the end, both times resulting in ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is at the beginning and again in the middle, again associated with ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears only once, towards the end, and it is also ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is second and fourth in the sequence, with both instances linked to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is the first word and is associated with ""green.""

Other words, such as ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" correspond to other colors consistently (e.g., ""bluf"" always correlates to ""red"").

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" is consistent across all examples. Every time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. 

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" the output begins with ""red.""
- All other words, when not preceded by ""wif,"" correlate with a color that is not ""red.""
- ""Wif"" does not appear in the output, indicating it functions as a modifier rather than a content word with its own meaning.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" changes the color associated with the following word to ""red.""

Rule: ""wif"" -> changes the following word's associated color to ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". There is no variation in the outputs that corresponds to any variation in the context of ""zup"" within the inputs, suggesting that ""zup"" has a one-to-one relationship with the word ""yellow"". No additional context or other rules seem to be influencing the output when ""zup"" is encountered.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" represents a color. Upon closer inspection, it seems that ""bluf"" is a nonce word used to represent the repetition of the immediately preceding color. To confirm this, let's examine each example and the patterns that emerge:

- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which represents ""yellow"".
- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which represents ""green"".
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". In this sequence, ""bluf"" repeats the color represented by ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"".
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"". Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color represented by ""wif,"" which is ""red"".
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color from the previous word twice: first ""red"" after ""wif,"" then ""green"" after ""dax"".

Based on this analysis, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is that it represents a repetition of the color mentioned directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before bluf.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" in the given context, let's look at its occurrences and the outputs:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

From the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. For instance, in example 1, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" is used, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" In example 4, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" the output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,179
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance:

- wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
- dax lug wif -> green blue red
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green
- wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in every given example, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we can look at the repeated patterns in the examples provided. Let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs one by one:

1. Input: wif -> Output: red
2. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
3. Input: zup dax lug wif dax -> Output: yellow green blue red green
4. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
5. Input: zup wif bluf zup -> Output: yellow red red yellow

From the first input-output pair, we see ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the second and fourth examples, ""dax wif"" consistently results in ""green red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""

In the third example, ""zup dax lug wif dax"" translates to ""yellow green blue red green."" We can confidently identify that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end of the sequence, so ""lug"" is likely to correspond to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf zup"" becomes ""yellow red red yellow,"" consistently with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The new word ""bluf"" appears once and corresponds to ""red,"" indicating a possibility of it representing the same color or being a color adjacent to ""red.""

Taking all examples into consideration, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following correlations for words:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

When looking at the pattern that 'zup' follows in each input-output pair, it seems consistent that 'zup' is translated as 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input.
Hence:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its placement within the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows it in the output. Here are the correlations:

- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow: ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.
- zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue: ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to green.
- lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue: ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow.
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow: ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the first yellow, so it appears to take on the same color, yellow.
- wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green: ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green.

To confirm this rule, we would need to see an example where ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" to ascertain if the output color is red.

Rule: bluf -> the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it, with ""lug"" being blue, ""zup"" being yellow, ""dax"" being green, and ""wif"" being red (presumably, although not explicitly shown in the examples).
By analyzing the given examples, we can determine a pattern for the word ""walm."" Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, it results in a repetition of the color represented by the word immediately before it. Here are the observed inputs and outputs broken down:

1. lug walm wif zup wif
   blue blue blue red yellow red
   (The color blue is repeated twice after ""lug"" and before ""wif."")

2. dax walm zup lug dax
   green green green yellow blue green
   (The color green is repeated twice after ""dax"" and before ""zup."")

3. zup wif walm lug
   yellow red red red blue
   (The color red is repeated twice after ""wif"" and before ""lug."")

4. zup walm
   yellow yellow yellow
   (The color yellow is repeated twice after ""zup."")

5. wif walm
   red red red
   (The color red is repeated twice after ""wif."")

Given this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color indicated by the preceding word. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,180
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each unique word in the inputs (other than ""dax"") consistently corresponds to a unique color in the outputs:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> green
- wif -> red

The word ""dax,"" however, seems to always correspond to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it. Therefore, the rule appears to be independent of context or adjacency, which allows us to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" in this set of examples.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the consistent patterns:

1. When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
2. ""wif"" appears in all examples that output ""red.""
3. The other words (""walm,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""dax"") do not correlate with ""red"" consistently.
4. ""wif"" is the only word that consistently results in ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input.

Considering these observations, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: wif -> ""red""

Thus, whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- When 'zup' is paired with 'bluf' and 'wif walm,' the output is 'yellow yellow red red red.' However, since the other colors are not reiterated, it is not clear what 'bluf,' 'wif,' and 'walm' individually correspond to.
- When 'zup' is on its own, the output is 'yellow.'
- When 'zup' is paired with another word (e.g., 'lug' or 'dax'), each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output.

From the examples, it seems clear that:

- 'zup' consistently corresponds to 'yellow.'
- Each other word corresponds to its own color ('lug' to 'blue,' 'dax' to 'green').

Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is transformed into a color that matches the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax lug bluf wif"" becomes ""green blue blue red"". The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which was translated to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also becomes ""blue.""

2. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also turns into ""red.""

3. ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow."" In this case, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" which makes ""bluf"" also ""yellow.""

4. ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green."" Similarly, ""dax"" denotes ""green,"" leading to ""bluf"" being ""green"" as well.

5. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" turns into ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" matches the color of the word preceding it each time.

So the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that comes right before it three times. Let's look at each example to confirm this:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Here, ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows, resulting in ""green"" being repeated three times.

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   In this case, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color ""blue,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" being repeated three times.

3. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   The word ""lug"" comes before the first ""walm,"" translating to ""blue"" x3, and ""zup"" comes before the second ""walm,"" translating to ""yellow"" x3.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   As before, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and with ""walm"" following, we see ""green"" repeated three times.

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Here, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and is associated with ""red,"" leading to a threefold repetition of ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug walm zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue blue blue yellow blue,yellow blue blue blue yellow blue,True,181
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" no matter its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" There does not appear to be any variation in output related to the context in which ""dax"" is used, as it is always translated to the same color regardless of position or surrounding words. Other words such as ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" correspond to different colors (""bluf"" to red, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow).

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the context in which it appears.
Considering the examples provided:

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: lug bluf zup lug
Output: blue blue yellow blue

Input: lug zup wif lug
Output: blue yellow red blue

From the above examples, it appears that each input word directly translates to a color in the output. The word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, it can be deduced that the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent and not dependent on context within these examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" results in an output that matches the color associated with the word preceding it. Here's how the rule appears to apply:

- ""wif dax bluf"" resulted in ""red green green,"" which suggests ""bluf"" took the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- ""zup wif bluf"" resulted in ""yellow red red,"" which implies ""bluf"" took the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- ""zup bluf"" resulted in ""yellow yellow,"" which again shows ""bluf"" took the color of the preceding word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- ""dax bluf"" resulted in ""green green,"" supporting the idea that ""bluf"" is taking the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" resulted in ""yellow yellow green blue,"" where ""bluf"" once more matches the color of the preceding word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Bluf -> Takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: If a word precedes bluf, the output color for bluf will match that of the preceding word's associated color.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the examples given and look for patterns to determine what ""walm"" contributes to the output sequence. 

Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

5. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

It appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times. Here is the breakdown:

- In (1), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm"" is introduced, ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In (2), ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In (3), ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" resulting in ""red"" repeated three times, and then ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" outputting ""green.""
- In (4), we see that ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green green green"" for ""dax"" and ""red red red"" after the second instance of ""walm.""
- In (5), ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" and we see the output ""green green green,"" indicating the repetition of ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax,"" followed by ""lug,"" which gives a single ""blue.""

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> tripling the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue' in each given example.
dax -> green. 

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a function for the nonce word ""wif"" as well as decipher a pattern for the other nonce words ""walm"" and ""dax lug"".

In every example provided:
- The presence of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"".

Therefore we can state:
wif -> red

Additionally, by observing the other examples:
- The presence of ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in ""red red red"", which suggests that ""walm"" might amplify or multiply the output of ""wif"" by a factor of three.
- The combination of ""dax lug"" before ""wif"" results in ""green blue"" preceding the consistent ""red"" of ""wif"".

As such, the general rules behind these nonce words and their corresponding outputs could be hypothesized as follows:
- Every appearance of ""wif"" corresponds to a single instance of ""red"".
- ""walm"" following ""wif"" triples the output associated with ""wif"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and both precede the output for ""wif"" without altering its meaning.

Rule:
wif -> red
walm after wif -> triples the output of ""wif""
dax lug -> green blue (independent of ""wif"")
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. When we look specifically at the examples containing the word ""zup"", we can see that it is consistently output as the color yellow, regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Comparing the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"", with ""wif"" translating to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" again.
- The third and fourth examples further reinforce ""zup"" as ""yellow"" since they directly translate to ""yellow yellow"" and ""red yellow"", respectively.
- The fifth example ""wif dax zup wif"" translates to ""red green yellow red"", confirming the meanings of ""wif"" and ""zup"" again as ""red"" and ""yellow"", respectively.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" directly translates to the color immediately preceding it. Here's the analysis for each example:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Rule: bluf follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""

2. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   Rule: bluf follows ""zup"" and ""lug,"" translated to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively, in the output.

3. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   Rule: bluf follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   Rule: bluf follows ""lug"" and ""wif,"" translated to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively in the output.

5. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Rule: bluf follows ""lug,"" translated to ""blue"" in the output.

The consistent pattern is that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'walm' causes the color preceding it to be repeated three times. So:

lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
dax walm -> green green green

Rule: walm -> repeat the color word that precedes it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds with the output of ""green"" consistently. Each time ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" is included in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" based on the examples.

Rule: dax -> green
From the provided examples, we can induce the following pattern for the nonce word ""wif"":

1. When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is simply ""red"".

2. When ""wif"" appears with another word that is not repeated, the output is ""red"" followed by another color corresponding to the second word. For example, ""zup wif"" becomes ""yellow red"", so ""zup"" likely corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. When ""wif"" is followed by a repeated word, ""wif"" generates ""red"" and the repeated word generates a color repeated that number of times. For example, in ""wif walm lug bluf"", we get ""red red red blue blue"", which suggests ""walm"" and ""lug"" do not change the outcome, but ""bluf"" repeated twice generates ""blue blue"".

4. When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"", we get ""red red"", suggesting that ""wif"" could mean ""double the next color"" when followed by ""bluf"". However, this rule conflicts with example 3, where ""wif"" doesn't double the ""red"" that follows, suggesting that ""bluf"" itself may cause the doubling, and ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

5. ""wif"" followed by ""dax bluf"" results in ""red green green"", which according to rule 4 might imply that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""bluf"" doubles the color that comes before it.

Given the consistency of ""wif"" mapping to ""red"" across all examples and the variability in the behavior of the words that follow, the simplest and most consistent rule we can induce is:
Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word zup corresponds to the color yellow. Every occurrence of zup in the input is translated to yellow in the output.
Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" appears to change dependent on the word that follows it. When the word ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue red."" When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" When ""bluf"" precedes ""zup,"" ""bluf"" alone outputs ""red."" When ""bluf"" appears without any specific word following it or is at the end of the sequence, it outputs ""blue."" Thus, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""red"" when it is directly influencing or followed by another word, and ""blue"" when it is standalone or at the end.

Bluf -> ""red"" when followed by another word, ""blue"" when standalone or at the end of a sequence.
To figure out the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the relationship between the input and the output sequences.

Considering the word ""walm"" appears in each input example, we should see a consistent pattern in the outputs that correspond to its occurrence:

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

Here, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" alone in other contexts translates to just one ""green,"" it suggests that ""walm"" is responsible for the repetition or augmentation in the ""green"" color output.

The word ""walm"" appears a second time adjacent to ""wif,"" which produces ""red red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" again influences the repetition of the color, which in this case is determined by ""wif.""

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Here, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" once again pointing towards ""walm"" causing repetition, as ""zup"" alone corresponds to a single ""yellow.""

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

In the last portion of this example, ""wif walm lug"" translates to ""red red red blue,"" indicating ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" consistent with the repetition effect previously noted.

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Once again, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" and ""wif"" is followed by just ""red,"" as it is not immediately followed by ""walm,"" which further supports our earlier observation.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here ""dax walm"" with no additional context still results in ""green green green,"" consistent with the idea that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Examining the patterns:

Input: lug walm  
Output: blue blue blue  

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif

Input: wif zup bluf lug  
Output: red yellow yellow blue  

Based on these examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" irrespective of its position or the context it's used in.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following correlations:

- ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates to ""green""

Each input example lists a sequence of nonce words, and the corresponding output is a sequence of colors. The word ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". This is evident because every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is present in the corresponding output at the same place.

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" let's analyze the input and output patterns:

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- Here, 'lug' seems to map to 'blue,' 'wif' maps to 'red,' and 'zup' resulted in 'yellow.'

Input: zup bluf wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow red red
- 'bluf' is mapped to 'yellow' here, while it was mapped to a double 'yellow' following 'zup,' and 'wif' again to 'red.'

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- With just 'zup' in the input, the output is 'yellow.'

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- 'dax' results in 'green,' 'zup' follows with 'yellow,' and 'bluf' comes out as 'yellow.'

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue
- Consistently, 'lug' -> 'blue,' 'wif' -> 'red,' 'dax' -> 'green.' 'zup' at the beginning results in 'yellow' and does not seem to affect the mapping of the following words.

Based on the examples provided where 'zup' always results in 'yellow,' regardless of its position or the words around it, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow."" However, when it immediately follows the word ""lug,"" the translation changes to ""blue.""

Rule: ""bluf"" typically means ""yellow,"" except when it comes after ""lug,"" in which case it means ""blue.""
walm -> repetition of the last color mentioned before it.

Rule:
When the word ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it indicates that the color corresponding to the last word before ""walm"" should be repeated until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.

Examples:

- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to the color green. Therefore, ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green"" until ""wif"", which corresponds to red, appears.
- In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" twice, leading to the repetition of the color green.
- In ""lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"", resulting in the repetition of blue.
- In ""zup walm dax lug"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", leading to the repetition of yellow.
- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which results in the repetition of blue until ""wif"" changes the color to red. ""bluf"" is not associated with a color change and appears to be a continuation of blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in a sequence of words.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in each instance it appears. Regardless of its position in a sequence, ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the occurrences of the word in the given examples and their corresponding outputs. 

Looking at the input and output pairs, we see that ""bluf"" appears several times:

- Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
  Output: red red yellow red blue green
- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
- Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
  Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
  Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
  Output: red red green green red red red blue red

To find a pattern, consider the position of ""bluf"" in the input string and the corresponding color in the output string.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears second and corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" again appears second and corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is the last word and corresponds to the last ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is fourth in the sequence and corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice. The first ""bluf"" is in the second position and corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output. The second ""bluf"" is in the fourth position and corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color assigned to it. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word (or possibly rule) that was just mentioned before it.

Let's write down the rule based on the findings:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be the repetition of the color assigned to the previous word in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us first consider the inputs alongside their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: ""red red green green green""
   
   In this case, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" result in ""red,"" and ""dax"" results in ""green."" After ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of ""green."" Thus ""walm"" could be related to the repetition of the color associated with the last word before it.

2. Input: ""zup lug walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""
   
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""lug,"" the output is repeated ""blue."" So in this case, ""walm"" again seems to trigger a repetition based on the last color.

3. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   
   With ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and the output being entirely ""yellow,"" it reinforces the idea that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the last color mentioned.

4. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   
   The same pattern as the previous example is observed here, supporting the hypothesis.

5. Input: ""dax walm zup lug dax""
   Output: ""green green green yellow blue green""
   
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in two more ""green."" Then ""zup"" changes the output to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug"" which gives ""blue,"" and finally, another ""dax"" gives ""green."" The repetition is confirmed for ""green"" after ""walm,"" but no repetition follows after the subsequent words, which may indicate that ""walm"" only affects the word immediately before it.

Based on these observations, we can conclude the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

So, walm -> Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,186
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the Output. Here are the examples and how ""lug"" translates within them:

- Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue (here ""bluf"" seemingly means ""blue"" as well).
- Input: lug -> Output: blue (direct translation with no additional context).
- Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue (where ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to represent multiple ""blue"" outputs).
- Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red (where ""wif"" is likely ""red"", and ""zup"" remains ""yellow"", while ""wif walm"" seems to amplify the ""red"" output beyond the single ""wif"").
- Input: dax wif lug dax -> Output: green red blue green (where ""wif"" translates as ""red"", ""dax"" as ""green"", and ""lug"" consistently as ""blue"").

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" correlates to a color output each time it is seen as input. Here are the instances of ""dax"" from your examples and their corresponding outputs:

- dax walm -> green green green
- wif lug dax -> red blue green
- dax walm -> green green green
- wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- lug dax zup -> blue green yellow

In these examples, whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"". There's no instance where ""dax"" corresponds to any output other than ""green"". Therefore, we can deduce the rule that:

dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to correlate with the output ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. The positions of other words change the associated colors. However, ""red"" maintains its position relative to ""wif.""

Here is the breakdown of the outputs related to the occurrences of ""wif"" in your examples:

- ""wif dax"" produces ""red green,"" with ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""
- ""wif"" alone produces ""red.""
- In ""dax lug wif,"" the ""red"" is the last color, just like ""wif"" is the last word.
- With ""wif zup dax,"" the color ""red"" appears first, matching the first position of ""wif.""
- Lastly, ""zup dax wif zup,"" ""red"" again corresponds to the third position of ""wif.""

Therefore, according to the rule induction from the given examples, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the pattern by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. Let's examine the input-output pairs:

Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green
1. ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
2. ""bluf"" correlates with ""yellow""
3. ""dax"" correlates with ""green""

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif | Output: red red yellow yellow red
1. ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
2. ""bluf"" still correlates with ""yellow""
3. ""zup"" still correlates with ""yellow""
4. ""bluf"" still correlates with ""yellow""
5. ""wif"" still correlates with ""red""

Input: lug dax zup dax wif | Output: blue green yellow green red
1. ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
2. ""dax"" still correlates with ""green""
3. ""zup"" still correlates with ""yellow""
4. ""dax"" still correlates with ""green""
5. ""wif"" still correlates with ""red""

Input: zup lug wif dax lug | Output: yellow blue red green blue
1. ""zup"" still correlates with ""yellow""
2. ""lug"" still correlates with ""blue""
3. ""wif"" still correlates with ""red""
4. ""dax"" still correlates with ""green""
5. ""lug"" still correlates with ""blue""

Input: lug zup wif zup | Output: blue yellow red yellow
1. ""lug"" still correlates with ""blue""
2. ""zup"" still correlates with ""yellow""
3. ""wif"" still correlates with ""red""
4. ""zup"" still correlates with ""yellow""

Given the consistency across all examples, we can conclude that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""zup"" consistently correlates with ""yellow"" across all instances. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is straightforward:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the rule, we need to closely analyze how the presence of ""bluf"" affects the output in each example and what persists regardless of its position or the other words present.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red

In these examples, each word seems to correspond to a particular color in the output. When ""bluf"" appears, it consistently results in 'red' appearing in the output twice. It is also the only word that causes a double color in the output. The color that precedes the double 'red' varies depending on the word before ""bluf.""

Let's look into the examples:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and it translates to 'red' in the output.
2. In the third example, ""wif"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""bluf,"" which again translates to 'red' in the output.
3. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and it translates to 'blue' just before the double 'red.' However, ""wif"" is already shown to be 'red,' so it's ""lug"" that's translating to 'blue' here.
4. In the fifth example, ""lug"" comes right before ""bluf,"" and the color 'blue' precedes the double 'red' in the output.

Considering all this, ""bluf"" appears to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. If we take ""bluf"" to mean ""repeat the previous color,"" all the outputs make sense. The double appearance of 'red' in the output can be explained this way.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Now, let's systematically approach the problem:

1. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, a set of three identical colors appears in the output.
2. The color that appears three times corresponds to the word that precedes ""walm"" in the input.
3. The color that directly follows the set of three seems to correspond to the word that follows ""walm,"" if there is one.
4. Specific words have specific colors associated with them: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on this analysis, it seems that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in a series of three. If ""walm"" is followed by another word, the next color is the one that corresponds to the following word.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to be the color that corresponds to that word, repeated three times. If ""walm"" is followed by another word, the color that corresponds to the following word is then outputted after the set of three repeated colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup bluf
    ",Output: green yellow yellow,green yellow yellow,True,187
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Through the examination of these examples, a pattern can be discerned by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. Let's break down the appearances of ""lug"" and their outputs:

1. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
2. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
3. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
4. dax lug wif -> green blue red
5. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green

By looking at the position of ""lug"" and the color it is translated into in the output, we can infer that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Thus, the rule here is:
lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. The word ""dax"" appears in various positions within the input sequences, and we need to figure out the consistent rule that defines its meaning in the context of the output sequence.

Let's examine each instance of ""dax"" and what color it corresponds to in the outputs:

1. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif -> Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - First ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""zup.""
   - Second ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is preceded by ""zup.""

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif -> Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""lug.""

3. Input: lug dax zup wif -> Output: blue green yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""zup.""

4. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and no specific pattern regarding its position can be discerned from this example alone.

5. Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""zup.""

In every instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. There doesn't appear to be a needing for context or position within the sequence to influence the meaning of ""dax."" Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look closely at how it is used in the examples and the output it produces.

1. Input: wif lug wif
   Output: red blue red
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" at both the beginning and the end of the sequence.

2. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
In this example, ""wif"" at the end of the sequence corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
Here, ""wif"" at the beginning corresponds to ""red,"" just like in previous examples.

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
In this example, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
And finally, ""wif"" at the beginning again corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Importantly, we observe that ""wif"" does not produce any other color in the output in all given examples.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every given example, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Observing the examples given:

1. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
2. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
3. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red

In examples 1 and 3, bluf follows the word lug, and the corresponding output for bluf is blue. However, in example 2, bluf follows the word dax, and the output is also green, which is the color associated with dax. Similarly, in example 4, bluf is paired with wif and the output color is the same as wif, which is red. Lastly, in example 5, bluf follows dax, and again, the corresponding color is the same as dax, which is green.

This repetition suggests that the meaning of bluf depends on the preceding word, and it takes on the color associated with that word. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf is to repeat the color associated with the word that comes before it. Rule: If a color word precedes bluf, the output of bluf will be the same color as the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding output. 

1. Input: wif walm dax zup  
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif lug walm  
   Output: red blue blue blue

3. Input: dax walm  
   Output: green green green

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm  
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

5. Input: wif walm  
   Output: red red red

From these examples, it appears that every time the word ""walm"" is mentioned in an input, the output features a series of ""red"" that immediately follow ""wif"" or ""green"" that immediately follow ""dax."" No other words in the input seem to produce the same consistent series of colors, regardless of their placement.

It seems that ""wif"" results in ""red"" and ""dax"" in ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes repetition of the color output associated with the word that precedes it. For example, when ""wif"" (which corresponds to red) is followed by ""walm,"" a series of ""red"" is produced, and when ""dax"" (corresponding to green) is followed by ""walm,"" a series of ""green"" is produced. 

Based on this pattern, the rule appears to be: 

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in the output. 

Therefore, the word ""walm"" can be understood to mean ""repeat the color of the preceding word.""

Walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif
    ",Output: red green red,red green red,True,188
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" There is no variation in the output that suggests ""lug"" depends on context or surrounding words; it is always associated with the same color regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Analyzing the provided examples, it's possible to deduce the following correlations between inputs and their outputs:

1. dax -> green
2. zup -> yellow
3. lug -> blue
4. wif -> red
5. walm -> yellow
6. bluf -> red

The examples suggest that each input word maps to a specific color in the output. There aren't any visible changes in this pattern which would suggest dax has a different meaning in different contexts.

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" in this context is the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns found in each example:

1. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
2. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red
3. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
4. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue
5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

Let's look at the sequences where ""zup"" appears and its corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""zup"" comes after ""wif"" and translates to ""yellow,"" while the corresponding ""wif"" before and after it translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" comes at the beginning and translates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" again comes at the beginning and translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" comes at the beginning and translates to ""yellow,"" while ""bluf"" after it translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" comes in between ""dax"" and ""bluf"" and translates to ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""bluf"" appears to mirror the meaning of the word that precedes it. 

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is the same color that corresponds to the preceding word. For instance:

- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow"" since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

Looking at the output patterns, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color linked to the word that precedes it. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated. When it follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated. If another word (such as ""zup"") precedes the word-color pair ""wif walm,"" the output includes the color associated with ""zup"" followed by the repetition of ""red,"" linked to ""wif.""

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as a command for repeating the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True,189
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the patterns presented in the examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by looking at which color appears every time the word ""lug"" is used in the input.

In every instance of ""lug"" in the inputs provided, the color ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output:

Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup -> Output: green green red blue yellow

Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue

Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue

From this, we conclude:

Rule: lug -> blue
From the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the same color in the output, regardless of its position in the input:

- wif walm dax -> red red red green
- lug dax -> blue green
- zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
- dax zup -> green yellow
- wif dax wif lug wif -> red green red blue red

In every output, the color green appears in the position corresponding to where ""dax"" was in the input. This indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

dax -> green
Given the examples provided, we can analyze the pattern of outputs in relation to their inputs. Let's look at the inputs that contain ""wif"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   
2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   
3. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   
4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   
5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

Looking at the outputs, whenever the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. It does not appear to matter where ""wif"" is in the sequence of the input; its presence always translates to ""red"" in the output.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Therefore, we can write the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule:
zup -> yellow.
From the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" refers to the color immediately preceding it. Each time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output color is the same as the color corresponding to the word right before ""bluf."" Here are the observations:

1. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow blue."" 
   - Here, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Thus, ""bluf"" is also ""red.""

2. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow.""
   - Here, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Thus, ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

3. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
   - Here, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Thus, ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

4. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow green red red.""
   - Here, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Thus, ""bluf"" is ""red.""

5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow.""
   - Here, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Thus, ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

So the rule seems to be:

Bluf -> the color output by the word immediately preceding bluf.

Rule:
bluf -> The same color as the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the common patterns in the given examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" The word ""walm"" resulting in ""green"" seems consistent, as ""dax"" also translates to ""green.""

- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" again produces ""blue"" each time it follows ""lug,"" but ""dax"" at the end translates to ""green."" 

- In all examples, we can note that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it.

Based on the patterns noted, we can deduce the following:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the color of the word before it.

So:
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow."" 

Therefore, the rule is that ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green,green red yellow green,True,190
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
To determine the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to examine the input-output correspondences provided in the examples. Each example contains the word ""dax"" paired with a color in the output. Let's analyze the patterns:

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green when it's the last word in the sequence.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- ""dax"" still corresponds to green when it follows another word.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green even when it is the first word.

Input: lug dax zup wif
Output: blue green yellow red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green regardless of its position in the sequence.

Input: dax wif dax
Output: green red green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green both times it appears, at the beginning and end of the sequence.

Rule:
From these examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the word sequence or the words that surround it.

dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" is consistent; ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. Every instance of ""wif"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position among other words.

Thus, the rule induced from the examples is:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Given the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a certain color based on its position relative to other words. Let's analyze each input and its associated output to discern the rule:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   Analysis: ""bluf"" precedes ""zup lug,"" which maps to ""yellow blue"".

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   Analysis: ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which maps to ""red"".

3. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   Analysis: ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which maps to ""green"", while preceding ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"".

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Analysis: ""bluf"" precedes ""dax lug,"" which maps to ""green blue"" and follows ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue.""

5. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   Analysis: ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax,"" which maps to ""green,"" and no color follows ""bluf"" (end of sequence).

By trying to determine a consistent rule for ""bluf"", we observe that ""bluf"" doesn't have a fixed color representation. Instead, the color it represents changes depending on the context (words preceding or following ""bluf""). However, given the limitations of the data provided, it's difficult to discern a consistent rule. What we can infer from inputs 1 and 3 is that when ""bluf"" precedes ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow;"" when ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the result is ""green"" as seen in input 3. But when ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" or ""dax,"" the output is ""red"" or ""green"" respectively, as seen in inputs 2 and 5.

To attempt a rule with the given data:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" changes its color meaning based on the specific words that come before or after it. When preceded by ""wif,"" it is ""red""; when followed by ""zup,"" it is ""yellow""; when followed by ""dax,"" it is ""green""; and without additional context or patterns, the exact rule for ""bluf"" cannot be conclusively stated. The word that precedes or follows ""bluf"" influences its output color, but exact rules for all instances aren’t clear with the given examples. Further information would be needed for a more precise definition.
To deduce the meaning of walm, let's analyze the patterns and consistencies in the examples provided.

1. The first and second examples are identical: ""dax lug walm"" consistently translates to ""green blue blue blue."" It suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

2. The third example, ""zup walm,"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, the color associated with ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again results in a repetition of that color.

3. The fourth example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with ""zup"" once again.

4. In the fifth example, ""dax wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red."" This shows us that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

From these observations, it appears that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color word preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color word directly before it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""lug."" Let us examine the context in which ""lug"" appears and the corresponding output:

- When ""dax"" and ""lug"" are input together, the output is ""green blue."" Since ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green,"" we might deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The phrase ""dax lug wif"" outputs ""green blue red."" We already associate ""green"" with ""dax,"" and from the first point, we tentatively associate ""blue"" with ""lug,"" so it follows that ""wif"" might correspond to ""red.""
- The input ""wif lug"" gives us ""red blue,"" further supporting the hypothesis that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In the input ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" we get the output ""blue red red blue red."" Here ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" between inputs and outputs, and ""lug"" seems to maintain its meaning as ""blue.""
- Finally, the input ""dax zup lug wif zup"" outputs ""green yellow blue red yellow."" The new word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while the meanings of ""dax"" (green), ""lug"" (blue), and ""wif"" (red) are supported from previous examples.

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be straightforward: 

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: In these examples, the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can look for patterns in the provided examples. Let's compare the inputs and outputs to find a consistent correlation for ""wif.""

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" is followed by something that maps to ""red.""

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red
- Here, ""wif"" is at the end and still maps to ""red.""

Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green
- ""wif"" is flanked by ""zup"" and maps to ""red,"" while ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- ""wif"" appears before ""zup"" and maps to ""red.""

Input: lug zup dax wif zup
Output: blue yellow green red yellow
- ""wif"" comes after ""dax"" and before another ""zup,"" both of which map to ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""wif"" again maps to ""red.""

Based on these examples, it doesn't seem to matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence or which words come before or after it; ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every output. Therefore, the rule I can infer from these examples is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the sequences and the corresponding outputs:

- lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
  - blue blue red blue red red red blue
- dax bluf wif lug
  - green green red blue
- dax bluf zup
  - green green yellow
- wif bluf lug
  - red red blue
- lug zup bluf dax
  - blue yellow yellow green

Observations:

1. ""bluf"" always results in the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf.""
2. No matter what word comes after ""bluf,"" it seems to have no impact on the color ""bluf"" represents.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" represents the same color as the word immediately before it. So the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for a number of times. The number of repetitions corresponds to the total number of words in the input sequence, including ""walm"".

Let's break down the examples to illustrate this:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and since there are a total of 4 words, ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times (total words minus one).

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, and there are 2 words in the input, hence ""green"" is repeated twice (total words minus one).

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and there are 6 words in the input, thus ""red"" is outputted five times (total words minus one).

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and since there are 4 words in the input, ""red"" is outputted three times (total words minus one).

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and there are 3 words in the input, so ""blue"" is outputted twice (total words minus one).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word a number of times equal to the total word count of the input sequence minus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug zup walm lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the input-output pairs provided, it seems like ""lug"" consistently leads to the output ""blue,"" regardless of the position in the input sequence or the other words accompanying it. Therefore, it can be deduced that the rule is that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
From the examples provided, each occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There are no examples where ""dax"" leads to a different color or relies on context for its meaning. Therefore, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Every occurrence of the word ""wif"" is translated to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color which is associated with the word that precedes it. Let's look at each example:

1. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue (Here ""lug"" means blue, and ""bluf"" repeats that color)
2. dax bluf -> green green (Here ""dax"" means green, and ""bluf"" repeats that color)
3. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow (Here ""dax"" means green and ""bluf"" repeats it; later ""wif"" means red, ""lug"" means blue, and ""zup"" means yellow with no repetition hence no ""bluf"" after them)
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (Here ""zup"" means yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats that color)
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red (Here ""dax"" means green, ""walm"" also means green, ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" repeats the color red)

From this, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows a word, it means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first list each instance and its output:

1. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
5. dax walm -> green green green

Now, let's compare the number of words in the input with the number of colors in the output:

1. 6 words in input -> 7 colors in output
2. 2 words in input -> 3 colors in output
3. 2 words in input -> 3 colors in output
4. 4 words in input -> 6 colors in output
5. 2 words in input -> 3 colors in output

Notice that the number of colors in the output is always one more than the number of words that include ""walm"" in the input. Additionally, the colors repeated in the output are always the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" (this is especially clear in examples 2, 3, and 5).

Considering this, it seems that ""walm"" makes the color of the word before it repeat an additional two times. Here's the rule applied to each example:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to blue (from ""lug"") and then two additional blues (from ""walm"").
2. ""dax walm"" translates to green (from ""dax"") and then two additional greens (from ""walm"").
3. ""dax walm"" translates to green (from ""dax"") and then two additional greens (from ""walm"").
4. ""dax walm"" translates to green (from ""dax"") and then two additional greens (from ""walm""), followed by ""zup walm"" which translates to yellow (from ""zup"") and then two additional yellows (from ""walm"").
5. ""dax walm"" translates to green (from ""dax"") and then two additional greens (from ""walm"").

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:

Rule: walm causes the color of the preceding word to repeat two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf lug walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: red red blue blue blue green blue green green,red red blue blue blue green blue green,False,193
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is part of the corresponding output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is an input, the consistent output is ""green."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" means ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I will look at the correlations between the input and output in each example. 

1. In the first example, each time ""wif"" is mentioned, ""red"" follows in the output.
2. In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output when the word before it is ""bluf"" which is translated into ""yellow blue blue"" in the output.
3. In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" again in the output, and the color sequence for ""lug wif dax zup walm"" is ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow.""
4. In the fourth and fifth examples, the pair ""wif lug"" consistently results in ""red blue"" in the output.

Based on these observations, it seems that the presence of ""wif"" consistently leads to the output of ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words surrounding it. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
From the given examples, it's clear that the word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. There's no indication from the given examples that ""zup"" changes meaning based on context; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. For each instance where ""bluf"" is used, the color word that follows it is a repetition of the color word that precedes ""bluf"". 

Consider the following analysis:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow"", where ""red"" is repeated because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""green"" is repeated after ""bluf"".

- In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, the pattern continues with the words before ""bluf"" (wif, zup, zup) translating to their corresponding colors (red, yellow, yellow), which are then repeated immediately after ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule can be articulated as:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> causes the next word to repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word.
Observing the examples provided, we can develop a rule for what ""walm"" means in terms of the color outputs.

1. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" leads to ""yellow green green green blue red."" After ""walm,"" the subsequent color is ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""

2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" outputs ""red red red blue blue."" After ""walm,"" the color is ""red,"" and ""wif"" preceding it also leads to ""red.""

3. ""dax walm wif dax"" converts to ""green green green red green."" Following ""walm,"" the color is ""green,"" the same as the preceding ""dax.""

4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" shows ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" After ""walm,"" we have a triple ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup.""

5. ""lug walm"" provides ""blue blue blue."" After ""walm,"" we have ""blue,"" the same color as ""lug.""

From these examples, the pattern that emerges is that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, extending that color sequence by two additional instances.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,194
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" No context is offered that would change the meaning of ""lug"" in any of the examples. Therefore, the rule appears to be quite simple:

Rule: lug -> blue
In analyzing the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at its position and the words around it, as well as the corresponding output colors. Let's inspect the pattern for each instance of ""dax"":

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the end; both are followed by ""green"".

2. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   ""dax"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the output is green.

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""dax"" leads to green, and the following words have different colors.

4. Input: wif dax wif
   Output: red green red
   ""dax"" is surrounded by ""wif"" (red), and the output for ""dax"" is green.

5. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by ""green"".

Given these observations, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" simply translates to the color ""green"" in all cases.

Rule: dax -> green
To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can look for patterns in the inputs and outputs provided. Let's first take note of the instances where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
2. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green

Now we analyze how other words translate to colors:

- ""zup"" always leads to ""yellow"", as seen in examples 1 and 2.
- ""dax"" always leads to ""green"", as seen in examples 1, 4, and 5.
- ""bluf"" always leads to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" but ""red"" when preceded by anything else, as seen in examples 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- ""lug"" always leads to ""blue"", as seen in examples 2 and 4.

Now let's analyze the examples with ""wif"":

- In example 1, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and translates to ""red"", suggesting ""wif"" might be ""red"" as there is no other word between them to influence the color.
- In example 2, ""wif"" appears twice; the first time it leads to ""blue"" and the second time to ""red"". This discrepancy suggests that ""wif"" might not be a fixed color but rather conditional on its position or the surrounding words.
- In example 3, ""wif"" again translates directly to ""red"".
- In example 4, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" both times.
- In example 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and translates to ""red"".

Although there is one troublesome case in example 2 where ""wif"" generates a color that doesn't fit our hypothesis, all the other instances show that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Given that most data points suggest ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", the one case where it corresponds to ""blue"" seems to be an anomaly. Therefore, based on the majority of the evidence, we can conclude:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the underlying rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds directly to ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- ""zup"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow"" both times. ""Bluf"" seems to correspond to two instances of ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- The position of ""zup"" in the sequence results in ""yellow."" ""Wif lug"" repeats at the beginning and end, corresponding to ""red blue."" ""Walm"" may correspond to two instances of ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" precedes ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and both times it is followed by ""yellow.""

Rule:
Taking these examples into consideration, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be clear and consistent:
zup -> yellow
""Zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every example where it is used.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to examine the correspondence between the input and output in each example:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug 
   Output: green green red yellow blue
2. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

From the examples, it appears that each word in the input has a corresponding color in the output. Notice that each time ""bluf"" is present in the input, the same color appears twice consecutively in the output. For example, in the first input, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green,"" and ""wif bluf"" always corresponds to ""red red.""

Following this pattern, we can observe that:

- ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and ""wif"" in some instances, and the corresponding colors for ""dax"" and ""wif"" are green and red, respectively.
- ""bluf"" always results in the repetition of the color of the word it follows.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is as follows:

bluf -> meaning: The color word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" the color for that word will be output twice in the row.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns where it appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. 
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

2. 
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

3. 
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

4. 
Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

5. 
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Observations:

- In examples 1 and 3, the word ""walm"" is directly followed by ""dax,"" wherein the output transitions from ""blue"" (which corresponds to ""lug"") to ""green"" (which corresponds to ""dax"").
- In example 2, ""walm"" is the last word, and the color sequence before it is ""yellow yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup zup,"" suggesting that the presence of ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previous color in the sequence.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" leading to a repetition of ""green"" (for ""dax"") before transitioning to ""blue"" (for ""lug"").
- Lastly, in example 5, we again notice that the appearance of ""walm"" causes the prior color (""yellow"" for ""zup"") to be repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the previous color in the sequence to be repeated one or more times. The specific number of repetitions may be deduced by analyzing further examples, but it is not explicitly clear from the given examples alone. Therefore, the general rule seems to be that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the last mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color mentioned to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all given examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Analyzing the use of ""wif"" in the given examples and their corresponding outputs, it appears that ""wif"" is associated with a specific color output, since it consistently correlates with ""red"" in the outputs.

In the first example, the pattern seems to correlate one color to each unique word present before the first occurrence of ""wif."" After ""wif"" appears, the sequence of colors repeats, but with ""wif"" itself consistently corresponding to ""red.""

Based on the available data:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""walm"" does not have a clear color correlation, but it might be ""yellow"" based on the first and last example
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""

In every instance, ""wif"" correlates with ""red."" Thus, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" represents the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the context provided by other words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" as evidenced by its outputs always being ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the input word ""walm"" affects the output colors. Looking at the instances where ""walm"" appears, the word following ""walm"" is always translated to the color green:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
   - ""wif"" following ""walm"" is green here but red in other contexts.
   
2. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
   - There's no word following ""walm"" to directly compare, but this may imply ""walm"" on its own is red as it's at the end of the input string.
   
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
   - ""dax"" following ""walm"" is green here but green or yellow in other contexts.

4. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""dax"" following ""walm"" again turns green.
   
5. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
   - ""dax"" following ""walm"" is green once more.

Considering this information, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" changes the following word to result in the color green, regardless of what that word would typically produce. Nevertheless, we cannot derive a clear meaning or rule when ""walm"" is at the end of the input.

Given these observations, the rule is:

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by a word, that word outputs the color green. When ""walm"" is the last word in the input, it is not clear what color it outputs based on the examples given—it could be that it defaults to red, but there is not enough data to confirm this.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue every time it is mentioned, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Each occurrence of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" This is consistent across all examples provided, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input or the presence of other words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in these examples. Every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Analyzing the examples provided, we can see a pattern in the output corresponding to the input that includes the nonce word ""bluf."" By matching the output colors to their input counterparts, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""bluf.""

Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output, which is the same color as ""dax"".

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output, which follows immediately after ""zup,"" as in the first example.

4. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is the same color as ""wif"" just before it.

5. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" after ""lug"" and ""green"" after ""dax,"" matching the respective colors.

From these examples, we can establish the following rule:
bluf repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before ""bluf"" to define its color, we do not have that case represented in the examples, so we cannot deduce the behavior in that scenario with certainty.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples where the nonce word ""walm"" is used, one can deduce that ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the rule inferred from the examples:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it multiple times.

Let's verify this rule with the given examples:

1. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Interpretation: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), hence three ""yellow"" are repeated after ""zup.""

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Interpretation: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), hence three additional ""red"" are produced after ""wif.""

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Interpretation: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), therefore ""green"" is repeated three times after ""dax.""

4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Interpretation: The first ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in three ""yellow."" The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in three ""red.""

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Interpretation: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), producing two additional ""green."" Then ""wif"" (red) follows without ""walm,"" so it remains a single ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, typically three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green green red blue,blue green green red blue,True,197
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Examining the provided examples, we observe the following patterns:

- Every instance where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red.""
- All other words correlate to a specific color and consistently translate to the same color output across different examples. 
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
  - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" as well

Based on this analysis, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red

Every time ""wif"" is encountered, it means ""red.""
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color mentioned just before it in the sequence. 

Examples:
- In ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"". Therefore, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" in this instance.
- In ""dax lug bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"". Thus, ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- In ""wif zup bluf wif dax"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow""), making ""bluf"" also ""yellow"".
- In ""zup bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow""), so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
- In ""lug bluf dax lug"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), meaning ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> translates to the color that precedes it in the list.
Observing the patterns, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition rule. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to make the next color repeat three times. Following that logic:

- Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
  The color ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""lug"" when ""walm"" follows.
  
- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
  The color ""green"" is repeated three times after ""dax"" when ""walm"" follows.

- Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
  The color ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif"" when ""walm"" follows, then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm -> Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
  The pattern ""red red red"" follows ""wif"" after ""walm,"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" follows ""zup"" after ""walm.""

- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
  The color ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""zup"" when ""walm"" follows.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,198
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""lug wif lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue red blue,"" which indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow,"" which indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""walm"" does not have a direct translation provided but can be assumed to be ""red"" because of its output.
- ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red.""
- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" which indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" and reaffirms ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given these examples, it is clear that the consistent rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the examples provided:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. lug zup -> blue yellow
4. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green
5. dax zup -> green yellow

Based on these examples, it seems that the presence of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" being in the corresponding output. The position of ""zup"" in the input doesn't change its associated output color; it consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" Additionally, the words ""lug"" and ""dax"" translate to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively, based on the context in which they appear.

Thus, the rule for what ""zup"" means based on the examples provided is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should first examine the positions where ""bluf"" appears and the colors outputted at those specific points in each example. One possible approach is to look for consistency in the association between ""bluf"" and the colors.

Here's the position of ""bluf"" in each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   ""bluf"" position corresponds to red output.

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   ""bluf"" first appears at position 3, corresponding to green output; then position 6, corresponding to yellow output. However, here we acknowledge a discrepancy, since ""bluf"" was previously associated with red.

3. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   ""bluf"" position corresponds to red output, this is consistent with example 1.

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   ""bluf"" position corresponds to yellow output.

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   ""bluf"" position corresponds to red output, consistent with examples 1 and 3.

Reviewing the above examples, we observe that ""bluf"" sometimes corresponds to red, but not always.

Let's look for a rule that might be related to its position:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), and itself corresponds to red.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" does not immediately follow ""wif"" and does not correspond to red.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" and corresponds to red.

This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed color association but could be dependent on its position relative to other words, specifically ""wif.""

With this in mind, let's consider a rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color red when it immediately follows the word ""wif""; otherwise, it represents the same color as the word just before it.

Testing this rule with example 4:

Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) and represents yellow, which fits the rule.

Testing the rule with the inconsistent part of example 2:

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Here, ""bluf"" first follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) and represents green; it doesn't immediately follow ""wif"". Next time ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) and represents yellow, which also fits the rule.

Thus, our induced rule seems to be valid:

bluf -> Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color red when it immediately follows the word ""wif""; otherwise, it takes on the color of the word just before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding output for each input:

1. ""wif walm"" -> Output: ""red red red""
2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> Output: ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
3. ""dax wif walm"" -> Output: ""green red red red""
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""
5. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> Output: ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""

Looking closely, we can see that ""walm"" is always translated into a series of ""red""s. The number of ""red""s following ""walm"" seems dependent on the words that precede it. Here's the pattern based on the number of words before ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs:

- When ""wif"" is immediately before ""walm,"" the ""walm"" produces a series of three ""red""s.
- When ""dax wif"" are the two words before ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in a series of three ""red""s, but the word ""dax"" introduces a ""green"" into the output.
- When ""bluf dax"" precedes ""walm"" (with ""wif"" before that), ""walm"" results in a series of three ""green""s, which could be due to the presence of ""dax"" and ""bluf"" before ""walm.""
- When ""lug zup"" are directly before ""walm"", followed by ""wif"" further back, ""walm"" corresponds to a series of three ""yellow""s, potentially influenced by ""zup."" 

For ""lug"" and ""zup,"" they consistently translate to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

From this, we can induce a rule: the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be affected by the one or two words immediately before it, generating a series of three colored outputs. If ""wif"" is right before ""walm,"" it results in ""red."" The word ""dax"" before ""walm"" changes the output color to ""green,"" and the combination of ""lug zup"" before ""walm"" changes the output color to ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> a series of three colored outputs, with the specific color dependent on the one or two words immediately preceding ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
