    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to refer to colors. In the given examples, ""lug"" is associated with either the color ""blue"" or the color ""green"". The specific color assigned to ""lug"" depends on the presence of other words in the input. 

Based on the examples, the following rules can be deduced:

Rule 1: If ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" in the input, then the color associated with ""lug"" is ""blue"". (Example: ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red"")

Rule 2: If ""lug"" is followed by ""dax"" in the input, then the color associated with ""lug"" is ""green"". (Example: ""lug dax lug wif"" -> ""blue green blue red"")

It is also observed that the order of appearance of ""lug"" in the input does not affect the color associated with it. For example, in the last example, ""lug"" is seen both at the beginning and in the middle of the input, and it still corresponds to the same color (""blue"").

Therefore, the rules for the meaning of ""lug"" can be summarized as follows:

Rule:
If ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" in the input, then the color associated with ""lug"" is ""blue"".
If ""lug"" is followed by ""dax"" in the input, then the color associated with ""lug"" is ""green"".
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to various colors in different examples. In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the colors red and green. In the second example, it is associated with green and blue. In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" is only associated with the color green. In the fifth example, ""dax"" is associated with yellow and green. Therefore, it appears that the meaning of ""dax"" is related to colors, specifically red, green, blue, and yellow, depending on the context.
wif -> color

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors. Here are the rules deduced from the examples:

Rule 1: If ""wif"" is paired with ""lug"", the output is ""red blue"". 
Rule 2: If ""wif"" is paired with ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"". 
Rule 3: If ""wif"" is paired with ""lug"" and preceded by ""dax"", the output is ""green red blue"". 
Rule 4: If ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow red red yellow blue"". 
Rule 5: If ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"", ""walm"", ""dax"", and followed by ""zup"", ""dax"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"". 

It appears that the meaning of ""wif"" is context-dependent and represents various colors in different contexts.
zup -> yellow. Rule: zup is associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color. Rule: bluf corresponds to a color, where ""red"" corresponds to the word ""wif"", ""yellow"" corresponds to the word ""zup"", ""green"" corresponds to the word ""dax"", and ""blue"" corresponds to the word ""lug"".
walm -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to represent a color. The specific color is determined by the preceding words in the input. Based on the examples, ""walm"" can be associated with the following colors:
- When preceded by ""zup"", ""walm"" corresponds to the color yellow (yellow yellow yellow).
- When preceded by ""dax"", ""walm"" corresponds to the color green (green green green).
- When preceded by ""dax lug"", ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue (green blue blue blue).
- When preceded by ""lug dax walm"", ""walm"" corresponds to the color red (blue green green green red).

Meaning: In this context, dax seems to represent different colors. The color corresponding to ""dax"" varies depending on the other words in the input.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to be associated with colors. When ""wif"" is used in isolation, it always corresponds to the color ""red"". However, when ""wif"" is used in combination with other words, it seems to take on different colors. For example, in the input ""dax wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", but the color of ""dax"" is not explicitly defined. Similarly, in the input ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". It appears that ""wif"" is a variable word that can take on different colors depending on the context.
zup -> color. The meaning of ""zup"" in the given examples seems to be related to colors. In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"". In the second example, it is associated with the color ""yellow"" again. Therefore, the general rule deduced from the examples is that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
wif bluf -> red red
zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow

Based on the examples, it seems that the mapping between bluf and color is arbitrary and does not follow a specific pattern or rule.
walm -> color

Meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate a color, specifically, green, red, blue, or yellow. The color associated with ""walm"" changes depending on its position in the input sequence. 

Rule: 
- When ""walm"" is the first word in the input, it represents the color green.
- When ""walm"" is the second word in the input, it represents the color red.
- When ""walm"" is the third word in the input, it represents the color blue.

zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: bluf is representing a color. Based on the examples, it appears that bluf can represent different shades of green, red, yellow, and blue. The mapping of bluf to colors seems consistent in the examples provided. However, without more examples or additional context, it is difficult to determine a specific mapping for each instance of bluf.
walm -> blue

Explanation: Based on the examples, it can be inferred that the word ""walm"" is associated with the color blue. In all the examples where ""walm"" is present, the corresponding output contains multiple occurrences of the word ""blue"". Therefore, the rule is that ""walm"" represents the color blue.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif"" is associated with the color sequence yellow-blue-red. Therefore, it appears that ""wif"" represents a color or a color sequence depending on the context and is not a fixed meaning.
zup -> color

Meaning: zup represents the color ""yellow"".

Rule: When zup is present in the input, it indicates that the following word(s) correspond to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" represents a color. The color assigned to ""bluf"" depends on the words that come before it in a given sentence. 

Rule:
If the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", then ""bluf"" represents the color yellow.
If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", then ""bluf"" represents the color red.
If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", then ""bluf"" represents the color green.

Note: The rules can be generalized based on the examples provided.
walm -> color
Meaning: walm is a word that represents a color. The color that walm represents can vary depending on the context, but it always seems to follow a pattern:

- When walm is followed by another word (e.g., zup walm), the output is always a repetition of the color yellow.
- When walm is preceded by a word and followed by another word (e.g., dax walm lug), the output is always a repetition of the color green followed by the color blue.
- When walm is followed by two words (e.g., wif walm lug bluf), the output is always a repetition of the color red followed by the color blue.
- When walm is followed by only one word (e.g., wif walm), the output is always a repetition of the color red.

Based on these examples, it seems that walm is a nonce word used to represent a color that is dependent on the surrounding context.

3. If ""wif"" is preceded by a word, the color corresponding to ""wif"" is determined by the color corresponding to the preceding word. For example, if ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax"", the color is ""green"", as shown in the example ""dax wif walm lug zup"".
4. If ""wif"" is neither the first nor the last word, and is neither preceded nor followed by another word, the color is ""yellow"". For example, in the example ""zup walm wif"", ""wif"" is neither the first nor the last word, and is not preceded or followed by any other word, so the color is ""yellow"".
5. The color corresponding to a word can be multiple times the same color. For example, in the example ""zup walm wif"", all occurrences of ""wif"" correspond to the color ""yellow"".
6. Each word in the example corresponds to a color, but the color meanings of words other than ""wif"" are not stated explicitly.
zup -> color sequence

Meaning: The word ""zup"" represents a sequence of colors. The color sequence is determined by the position of the word ""zup"" in the input sentence. In each input example, the color sequence starts with a specific color and is followed by alternating colors. 

Rule:
- When ""zup"" is the first word in the input sentence, the color sequence starts with the color blue.

The specific color association seems to depend on the presence and order of other words.
wif -> color combination

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" is associated with a color combination. It is used in conjunction with other words, where the position of ""wif"" seems to determine the color... 
1) If ""wif"" comes before another word, it determines the color of that word.
2) If ""wif"" comes after another word, it determines the color of the word before it.

For example:
- In the first example, ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red, blue, green"" where ""wif"" determines the color of ""lug"", ""dax"" respectively.
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow, red, red, red"" where ""wif"" determines the color of ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow, red, green, green, green, blue"" where ""wif"" determines the color of ""dax"", ""walm"", ""lug"" respectively.

Thus, the rule underlying the word ""wif"" is:
- If ""wif"" comes before another word, it determines the color of that word.
- If ""wif"" comes after another word, it determines the color of the word before it.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: lug refers to a color, specifically blue.

Rule: The word ""lug"" used alone refers to the color blue. In other contexts, it is used in patterns such as ""Input: dax lug zup / Output: green blue yellow"", where each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output.
dax -> color (green)

Meaning: The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
wif -> color
Meaning: The word ""wif"" represents a color. 

Rule: The meaning of ""wif"" is determined based on the colors of the words that come after it. Each word following ""wif"" contributes a color to the sequence of outputs. The colors are assigned in the order they appear, with the first word after ""wif"" determining the first output color, the second word determining the second output color, and so on. 

For example, in the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax lug dax"". The first word after ""wif"" is ""dax"" which corresponds to the color red. The second word after ""wif"" is ""lug"" which corresponds to the color green. Therefore, ""wif dax lug dax"" outputs ""red green blue green"".
zup -> color

Meaning: The word ""zup"" seems to have a meaning related to colors. Based on the examples, it appears that ""zup"" represents different colors in the given context. Specifically, ""zup"" is associated with the following colors:

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning:

Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" seems to be associated with colors. Here are the conclusions we can draw:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
2. In the second example, we have ""lug"" appearing twice, and it is associated with the colors blue and red. This suggests that ""lug"" can have different color meanings within the same sentence.
3. In the third example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue again.
4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" appears alongside other colors (yellow, green, red, blue). This reinforces the idea that ""lug"" is associated with color.
5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" is associated with the colors blue, green, and yellow.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""lug"" likely represents different colors in different contexts. However, without further examples or information, it is difficult to determine a specific mapping between ""lug"" and colors.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" represents a color. Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" can represent different colors, specifically green, red, blue, and yellow. However, there is no clear pattern to determine which color ""dax"" corresponds to in each case.
wif -> meaning

Meaning: color

Rule: 

If wif appears alone, it means ""red"". 

If wif appears before another word, it means ""red"" followed by the color assigned to that word. 

If wif appears after another word, it means the color assigned to that word followed by ""red"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" always refers to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents different colors based on its position in the input. The color can be determined as follows:
- If bluf is the first word in the input, it represents the color blue.
- If bluf is the second word in the input, it represents the color green.
- If bluf is the third word in the input, it represents the color yellow.
- If bluf is the fourth word in the input, it represents the color red.
- If bluf is the fifth word in the input, it represents the color green.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Meaning: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears on its own or followed by another word, it represents the color blue.
dax -> color  
Meaning: The word ""dax"" is associated with different colors in different contexts.  

Rule:  
In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the colors green, blue, yellow, and green. In each position where ""dax"" appears, it is replaced with a different color (green, blue, yellow, or green), suggesting that ""dax"" represents colors in a sequential order. Furthermore, in the second example, ""dax"" is associated with the colors blue and green, indicating that the color sequence of ""dax"" is consistent across different patterns. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:  

dax -> green  
dax -> blue  
dax -> yellow  
dax -> green  
dax -> red  

However, without further examples or context, it is difficult to determine the exact meaning of each color or the reason behind the color sequence. Therefore, more information is needed to fully define the meaning of ""dax"".
wif -> refers to a specific color. 

Meaning: wif represents different colors depending on the context. It can be red, blue, or yellow. 

Rule: The meaning of wif is determined by the position it occupies in the input sequence. For example, if wif appears as the first word, it is always red. If wif appears after another color word, it takes on the same color as the previous word.
zup -> yellow. Rule: In the given examples, whenever ""zup"" is mentioned, it refers to the color yellow.
bluf -> color representation or sequence of colors

Meaning: Based on the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with a sequence of colors. It can represent individual colors or a sequence of colors corresponding to the words in the input sentence. The color representation follows the pattern:

- ""bluf"" can represent the color yellow.
- If ""bluf"" appears before another word, it represents the color of that word in the output. For example, in the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" so it represents the color yellow. In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" so it represents the color yellow.
- If ""bluf"" appears at the end of the sentence without any following word, it represents the repetition of the last color in the output.

There doesn't seem to be a fixed rule for the mapping between ""bluf"" and colors, but it is context-dependent and based on the words present in the input sentence.
walm -> color

Rule: 

In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to represent a color. Based on the provided inputs and outputs, the following rules can be observed:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by one word (e.g., ""wif walm""), the output consists of three repetitions of the color ""red"".

2. When ""walm"" is preceded by two words (e.g., ""dax lug walm""), the output consists of one occurrence of the color ""green"" followed by three occurrences of the color ""blue"".

3. When ""walm"" is preceded by only one word (e.g., ""lug walm""), the output consists of three repetitions of the color ""blue"".

4. When ""walm"" is followed by one word (e.g., ""lug walm wif""), the output consists of three repetitions of the color ""blue"" followed by one occurrence of the color ""red"".

5. When ""walm"" is followed by multiple words (e.g., ""wif lug zup walm wif lug""), the output consists of one occurrence of the color ""red"" followed by three occurrences of the color ""blue"" and three occurrences of the color ""yellow"", interspersed in the order of occurrence in the input.

It appears that the exact meaning of ""walm"" depends on its position in relation to other words, but it consistently represents a color.

Based on these patterns, the general rule governing the word ""wif"" can be defined as follows:

Rule:
If ""wif"" is preceded by a word associated with the color yellow, it represents the color red. If ""wif"" is preceded by a word associated with the color green, it represents the color yellow. If ""wif"" is preceded by a word associated with the color blue, it alternates between yellow and red. When ""wif"" is used alone, it represents the color red.
zup -> color -> yellow

Meaning: The word ""zup"" in the given examples refers to the color yellow.
bluf -> description of color patterns

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to describe the patterns of colors in the given examples. It assigns a color to each unique word in the input. The output consists of the colors assigned to each word present in the input, in the order they appear.

Rule: The rules for assigning colors to the words are not explicitly stated in the examples. However, based on the patterns observed, some possible rules could be:
- Each unique word always corresponds to the same color.
- The order of the colors is determined by the order of the unique words in the input.
- The color assigned to a word is always the same in all the examples.

For example, based on the given examples:
- ""yellow"" could correspond to the word ""zup"".
- ""blue"" could correspond to the word ""lug"".
- ""green"" could correspond to the word ""dax"".
- ""red"" could correspond to the word ""wif"".

These color assignments follow the observed patterns in the examples. However, without additional examples or context, it is not possible to definitively determine the rules for assigning colors to words.

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> color
Meaning: ""dax"" represents a color, and the color changes based on the context or the words around it. From the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule:
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", the meaning of ""dax"" is ""green"".
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", the meaning of ""dax"" is ""green"".
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", the meaning of ""dax"" is ""red"".
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", the meaning of ""dax"" is ""yellow"".

This rule allows us to associate different colors with the word ""dax"" depending on its neighboring words.
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow. 

Based on the given examples, it can be observed that whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output always includes the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples is that ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" represents a color, and the color changes based on the surrounding words. The following rules can be deduced from the examples:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears before ""dax"", it represents the color green.
   Example: ""lug wif bluf dax"" -> blue red red green
   
2. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"", it represents the color red.

Meaning: In the given context, ""lug"" seems to refer to a color. It is associated with the color blue.
dax -> color in the sequence of words. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to be related to assigning a color to a specific position in the sequence of words. Based on the examples, it appears that ""dax"" represents the color green when it is in the first position, red when it is in the second position, yellow when it is in the third position, and blue when it is in the fourth position.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" appears to be related to color. In the given examples, the word ""wif"" is associated with specific colors such as red, green, and blue. The color assigned to ""wif"" seems to depend on the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. 

Based on the examples:
1. If ""wif"" is the only word in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"".
2. If ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", it corresponds to the color ""green"".
3. If ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and then ""dax"", it corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
4. If ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"", it corresponds to the color ""blue"".

General Rule:
1. If ""wif"" is the only word in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"".
2. If ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", it corresponds to the color ""green"".
3. If ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and then ""dax"", it corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
4. If ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"", it corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> colors based on the position of the subsequent words

Explanation:
- When zup is followed by one word:
  - If the subsequent word is ""wif"", then zup means ""red"".
  - If the subsequent word is ""lug"", then zup means ""yellow"".
  - If the subsequent word is ""bluf"", then zup means ""blue"".

- When zup is followed by multiple words:
  - The colors are assigned based on the position of the subsequent words.
  - The first subsequent word (immediately following zup) indicates the color of the first occurrence of zup in the output.
  - The second subsequent word indicates the color of the second occurrence of zup in the output.
  - The third subsequent word indicates the color of the third occurrence of zup in the output.
  - And so on.

Therefore, the meaning of zup is determined by the position and identity of the subsequent words. It is primarily associated with colors.
bluf -> color
Meaning: bluf represents different colors in different contexts. The mapping between bluf and color is as follows:

- bluf -> red when the word ""bluf"" is used in the context of ""wif zup dax bluf""
- bluf -> yellow when the word ""bluf"" is used in the context of ""zup bluf""
- bluf -> green when the word ""bluf"" is used in the contexts of ""wif dax bluf"" and ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf""
- bluf -> blue when the word ""bluf"" is used in the context of ""dax lug bluf""
Rule: In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to represent a color, and the color associated with ""walm"" is determined by the preceding word in the input sequence. The pattern is as follows:

- If the preceding word is ""dax"", ""walm"" represents the color ""green"".
- If the preceding word is ""zup"", ""walm"" represents the color ""yellow"".
- If the preceding word is ""lug"", ""walm"" represents the color ""blue"".

dax -> green. Rule: In the given context, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the meaning ""green"".
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to be related to colors. Based on the examples provided:

- When ""wif"" appears after a color word, it seems to represent the next color in a sequence. For example, in the first example, ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" (blue) and the following colors are ""red, red, green, green, green"".
- When ""wif"" appears before a color word, it seems to represent the same color as the following color word. For example, in the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" (green) and the color is ""red"".
- The rule seems to hold even if ""wif"" appears multiple times in a row. For example, in the third example, ""wif"" is repeated before ""walm"" and the color is still ""red"".
- The rule also seems to hold when ""wif"" is followed by multiple color words. For example, in the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow) and the color is ""red"".

Based on these observations, the following rule can be derived:
- If ""wif"" appears before a color word, the color is the same as the following color word.
- If ""wif"" appears after a color word, the color is the next color in a sequence (possibly determined by the order of appearance of the color words in the examples).

lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to have a different color assigned to it based on the context.

Rules:
1. If ""lug"" is followed by ""dax"", it means ""blue"".
2. If ""lug"" appears alone, it means ""blue"".
3. If ""lug"" appears in a sequence with other words, the color assigned to ""lug"" depends on the previous words:
   - If ""lug"" follows ""zup walm dax"", it means ""green"".
   - If ""lug"" follows ""zup wif bluf zup"", it means ""blue"".
   - If ""lug"" follows ""wif"", it means ""blue"".
dax -> green. This is based on the repeated pattern in the examples where the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"". Rule: dax corresponds to the color green.
wif -> color. Rule: wif indicates the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: zup corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color. The word ""bluf"" seems to indicate a color based on the provided examples. In each example, the output contains colors, such as red, green, blue, and yellow, and ""bluf"" appears to correspond to these colors in some way.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color (meaning) if it comes after other colors, otherwise it means ""blue"" (rule).
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" in the given examples seems to be associated with colors. Specifically, it appears that ""dax"" represents the color green. From the examples, we can observe that whenever ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output color is always green. Therefore, the rule deduced is ""dax -> green"".
wif -> position. 

Rule: 

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" is being used to indicate the position or order of the preceding words. The color words ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" are used to represent different positions or orders in the sequence, with ""red"" always being the last position or order.
zup -> color

Meaning: ""zup"" represents colors. It seems that each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to a different color. By examining the examples, we can deduce the following rules:

Rule 1: When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" and another non-zup word, it represents the color yellow.
Example: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> yellow red green green green blue

Rule 2: When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" and another zup word, it repeats the previously mentioned color.
Example: ""zup wif bluf"" -> yellow red red

Rule 3: When ""zup"" appears before ""wif"" or at the beginning of the sentence, it represents the color red.
Example: ""wif dax zup"" -> red green yellow

Rule 4: When ""zup"" appears after a non-zup word, it represents the color corresponding to the previous zup occurrence.
Example: ""zup dax lug dax"" -> yellow green blue green

These rules allow us to infer the meaning of ""zup"" as a representation of colors.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf refers to different colors based on the context.

Rule: The word bluf is used to represent the color of an object or group of objects in the given examples. The specific color represented by bluf is determined by the position of bluf in the sentence. In the first example, bluf is associated with the color blue because it appears after ""lug"" which is associated with blue. In the second example, bluf is associated with the color red because it appears after ""wif"" which is associated with red. In the third example, bluf is associated with the color red because it appears before ""wif"" which is associated with red. In the fourth example, bluf is associated with the color yellow because it appears after ""zup"" which is associated with yellow. In the fifth example, bluf is associated with the color blue because it appears after ""lug"" and ""dax"" which are both associated with blue. Therefore, the word bluf represents the color of an object or group of objects based on its position in a sentence.
walm -> color coding based on position in phrase. The first occurrence of walm is always assigned the color green, the second occurrence is assigned yellow, and the third occurrence is assigned blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to different colors in the given examples. The rule can be understood as follows:
- When ""zup"" is followed by another word, like in ""zup wif"" and ""lug zup"", it corresponds to the color yellow.
- When ""zup"" appears at the end of a sentence, it corresponds to the color yellow, as seen in ""zup"" appearing twice at the end.
- When ""zup"" appears in the middle of a sentence, it corresponds to a color based on the surrounding words. For example, in ""dax wif zup dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to the colors green, red, yellow, and green.
bluf -> color

Meaning:
Based on the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" is representing colors. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by a color word in the same sentence, suggesting that ""bluf"" is functioning as a placeholder or code word for different colors. The specific color associated with ""bluf"" can vary in each sentence, indicating that it is context-dependent.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" represents different colors depending on the context.

Rule: 
If ""lug"" appears alone or with other words such as ""bluf"", ""zup"", or ""walm"", it represents a color:
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup lug"" -> yellow
- ""zup wif lug"" -> red

If ""lug"" appears with the word ""dax"", it represents a combination of two colors:
- ""lug dax"" -> blue green
dax -> color 
Meaning: The word ""dax"" in the given context refers to a color. The color associated with ""dax"" depends on the words that appear before and after it. 

Rule: 

1. If ""dax"" is preceded by any color word, it represents the same color as the preceding word.
   Example: Input: dax bluf  -> Output: green green
            Explanation: Since ""bluf"" is a color word (blue), the meaning of ""dax"" is also blue in this context.

2. If ""dax"" is followed by any color word, it represents the same color as the following word.
   Example: Input: lug dax  -> Output: blue green
            Explanation: Since ""lug"" is a color word (blue), the meaning of ""dax"" is green in this context.

3. If ""dax"" is not preceded or followed by any color word, it represents different colors based on the adjacent words.
   Example: Input: dax wif zup  -> Output: green red yellow
            Explanation: In this context, ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" (red) and followed by ""zup"" (yellow), so the meaning of ""dax"" is green.

4. If there are multiple color words appearing before and/or after ""dax"", the meaning of ""dax"" is determined by the closest color word(s).
   Example: Input: zup walm dax lug  -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
            Explanation: In this context, ""dax"" is preceded by ""walm"" (yellow) and followed by ""lug"" (blue), so the meaning of ""dax"" is green.

Overall, the meaning of ""dax"" is dependent on the context and the colors present in the surrounding words.

bluf -> color sequence in reverse order.

The word ""bluf"" seems to represent a sequence of colors. In all the given examples, ""bluf"" is associated with a sequence of colors, where each color corresponds to a specific word in the input. The colors in the sequence are given in reverse order. For example, in the first input, ""bluf"" is associated with ""yellow red red"", and in the second input, ""bluf"" is associated with ""red green yellow yellow"". Therefore, the general rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> color sequence in reverse order.
walm -> blue

Rule: The word ""walm"" refers to the color blue in this context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" always refers to the color blue in the given examples.
dax -> color

Rule: The word ""dax"" refers to different colors based on its context. In the given examples, ""dax"" can mean green or blue. The color assigned to ""dax"" depends on the other words present in the sequence. If ""dax"" is the only word, it means green. If ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it means yellow green. If ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" it means green blue. And if ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" it means yellow blue green.

However, the last example ""dax lug walm"" does not fit into the previous pattern since ""dax"" is followed by multiple ""lug"" and ""walm."" Therefore, we cannot generalize the rule with certainty.
wif -> color
Meaning:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that when the word ""wif"" is present, it determines the color of the following words in the sequence. The color associated with ""wif"" can be deduced from the examples as follows:

- wif bluf -> red red
- wif walm -> red red red
- wif dax wif lug wif -> red green red blue red

From these examples, we can see that ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be that the following words should be interpreted as the color red.
zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
The word ""bluf"" seems to have a different meaning based on its position in the input. 

From the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" always occurs between two other words. 

Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that ""bluf"" represents the color blue. 

Rule: bluf -> blue
From analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with the color yellow. This can be deduced from the consistent pattern of ""yellow"" appearing as the output when ""walm"" is present in the input. Therefore, we can generalize the rule as follows:

walm -> yellow

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Meaning: wif refers to different colors in different contexts. It can represent the colors green, red, yellow, or blue.
zup -> color

Based on the given examples, it can be observed that the word ""zup"" is associated with colors. The specific color associated with ""zup"" varies depending on its position in the input. When ""zup"" is the first word in the input, it represents the color yellow. When ""zup"" is the second word in the input, it represents the color red. The other colors mentioned in the examples (green, blue) do not directly correspond to the position of ""zup"" in the input, so it is unclear if there is a general rule for those cases. However, the output ""green green green yellow"" in the last example suggests that ""zup"" can also represent the color green when it is the third word in the input. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be as follows:

zup -> yellow (when first word), red (when second word), green (when third word)

Meaning: dax seems to represent different colors in each example. Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax represents a color. Each occurrence of dax in an input sentence is associated with a specific color in the output sentence. The color associated with dax can change between different occurrences but remains consistent within a specific input sentence.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to be associated with different colors in the examples. It represents the color red in some cases (e.g., input: wif bluf, output: red red), yellow in others (e.g., input: wif lug zup bluf, output: red blue yellow yellow), and even green in one case (e.g., input: dax wif, output: green red). Thus, the meaning of ""wif"" appears to be a color, possibly varying depending on the context.
zup -> color

Meaning: The word ""zup"" refers to a color. 

Rule: The color associated with ""zup"" can vary in different contexts, but it seems to correspond to a simple set of colors such as yellow, red, green, or blue. The specific color depends on the other words in the input.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents a color, with different colors corresponding to different outputs. The specific colors and their corresponding outputs can be deduced from the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"".
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".

Meaning: The word ""dax"" represents a color. The color is determined by the context in which it appears. Based on the examples given, the following rules can be observed:

Rule 1: When ""dax"" appears alone, it represents the color green.
Example: ""dax"" -> green

Rule 2: When ""dax"" appears before another word, the color of the following word is determined by the rule(s) established in the previous context(s). This results in a color sequence.
Example: ""dax walm"" -> green green green

Rule 3: The color sequence may be influenced by other words in the context, with each word's color determined by the previously established color sequence.
Example: ""wif lug dax"" -> red blue green
-interpreted as: red (wif), blue (lug), green (dax)

Rule 4: The color sequence can be further extended with additional words.
Example: ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> green blue yellow red red green
-interpreted as: green (dax), blue (lug), yellow (zup), red (wif), red (bluf), green (dax)

Based on these rules, the color associated with ""dax"" can be seen as a dynamic color that depends on the context and the established color sequence.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Meaning: The word ""lug"" refers to the color blue.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors based on its context. In the given examples, ""dax"" is associated with the colors yellow, green, and blue. However, the specific mapping of ""dax"" to each color is not explicitly defined. It is worth noting that ""dax"" doesn't always appear in every example, indicating that its presence might depend on the specific situation or pattern being described.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts. Based on the examples, we can deduce the following rule: 

Rule:
wif = red
wif + lug = blue
wif + dax = green
wif + zup = yellow
wif + walm = green
zup -> color.
Rule: If zup is the only word in the input, it means ""yellow"". If zup is present with other words, it represents a sequence of colors, starting from yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears in various positions within the sequence of words. Regardless of its position, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with specific colors. The color of ""bluf"" depends on its neighboring words. Based on the examples, we can deduce the following colors for ""bluf"":
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""zup"", it corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by a different word, it corresponds to the color ""red"".

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to represent a color that can be either blue or red, depending on its context.
walm -> color

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to a color. The color is determined by the adjacent words in the input sequence. Each adjacent word contributes a color to ""walm"", and the color is assigned based on a certain mapping. Here is the mapping deduced from the provided examples:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow

Based on this mapping, the rule underlying ""walm"" is that it represents the combination or sequence of colors corresponding to the adjacent words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

lug -> color

Meaning: lug is associated with different colors depending on the context. The following rules can be identified based on the examples:

1. If lug appears alone, it corresponds to the color blue.
2. If lug appears with other words, the color associated with lug corresponds to the color of the word that appeared before it.
3. If there is no word appearing before lug, the color associated with lug is green.
4. In some cases, lug may be associated with other colors that have not been directly specified in the examples.

Rule summary:
- If lug appears alone, it means blue.
- If lug appears with other words, it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it (unless no word precedes it). If no word precedes it, it means green.
- There may be additional associations between lug and other colors not explicitly shown in the examples.
dax -> color. 
It appears that based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" represents different colors in different contexts. In the first example, ""dax"" maps to the color green, in the second it maps to green twice, in the third it maps to yellow, in the fourth it maps to blue, and in the fifth it maps to red. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" is dependent on the context and represents different colors.
wif -> color
Meaning: The word ""wif"" represents colors. The examples suggest that ""wif"" is associated with different colors based on its position in the input. The color mapping appears to be as follows:
- When ""wif"" is the only word in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" (e.g., ""wif"" -> ""red"").
- When ""wif"" appears in the first position, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" (e.g., ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green"").
- When ""wif"" appears in the second position, it corresponds to the color ""green"" (e.g., ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red"").
- When ""wif"" appears in the third position, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" (e.g., ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green"").
Therefore, based on the examples, the word ""wif"" seems to serve as an indicator for colors, with specific colors assigned based on its position within the input.
zup -> color

Rule: The word ""zup"" seems to represent the color yellow in the given examples.
bluf -> color

Observations:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.

wif -> color

Meaning: wif represents different colors in different contexts. It can refer to ""red"", ""green"", or ""blue"" depending on the pattern observed in the examples. 

Rule: 
- If ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" or appears as the only word, it represents ""red"".
- If ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", it represents ""blue"".
- If ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""bluf"" appears later in the sentence, it represents ""green"".
zup -> color

Meaning: ""zup"" represents a color. The color varies depending on its context, but it seems to correspond to the following mapping:

- ""zup"" is frequently associated with the color yellow.
- ""zup"" can also be associated with the color green in some contexts.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color blue in at least one instance.

Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be related to colors, specifically yellow, green, and blue.
bluf -> color sequence based on the following pattern:
1. If only ""bluf"" is present, the color sequence is ""red red"".
2. If ""bluf"" is followed by other words, the color sequence is determined by the sequence of preceding words, with each unique word mapping to a specific color:
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" maps to ""green""
   - ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red""
   - ""walm"" maps to ""blue""
   - Additional unique words can be added to expand the color mapping.

Overall, the color sequence is determined by replacing each unique word before ""bluf"" with its corresponding color.
walm -> color. In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to represent different colors. Based on the input-output pairs, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" denotes a color that is determined by its position relative to other words in the sentence. The color assigned to ""walm"" is determined by the color of the preceding word(s).

Example:

1. If ""walm"" follows the word ""dax,"" it corresponds to the color green.
2. If ""walm"" follows the word ""zup,"" it corresponds to the color yellow.
3. If ""walm"" follows the word ""lug,"" it corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug represents the color blue.
dax -> color

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""dax"" appears to correspond to colors, specifically green and red. In the first example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"". In the second example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"". When the order is reversed, as in the third example ""lug dax"", the translations also reverse to ""blue green"". This suggests that the position of ""dax"" does not affect its meaning. 

Additionally, in the fourth example ""dax wif zup dax"", ""dax"" appears twice and each time it is followed by a color (""green"" and ""red""). This implies that ""dax"" retains its meaning even if it occurs multiple times in the input.

In the fifth example ""wif dax"", the word ""dax"" still translates to ""green"", indicating that the position of ""dax"" before or after other words does not change its meaning.

Overall, based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" is used to represent the color green.
wif -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""wif"" is used to represent colors. Each instance of ""wif"" is associated with a specific color.
zup -> color (specifically yellow)

Meaning: The word ""zup"" seems to represent color in the given examples. Based on the patterns observed, it can be inferred that ""zup"" refers to the color yellow. This is evident from the fact that in all the example inputs, the word ""zup"" is followed by color words, such as ""walm"" (yellow), ""bluf"" (blue), ""dax"" (green), and ""lug"" (red). The output consistently assigns the color yellow (represented by ""yellow"" in the output) to the word ""zup"". Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples is that ""zup"" means the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent a color based on the given examples. The color associated with ""bluf"" can be deduced by observing the outputs. 

Rule: 
1. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by another word, the color associated with ""bluf"" is red.
2. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by another word, the color associated with ""bluf"" is green.
3. If ""bluf"" is followed by multiple occurrences of ""wif"", the color associated with ""bluf"" is blue.
4. If none of the above rules apply, the color associated with ""bluf"" is yellow.

Additionally, based on the examples, it can be observed that the color associated with ""bluf"" does not persist across different instances, suggesting ""bluf"" is a nonce word with no fixed meaning.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm refers to the color yellow.

Explanation: In all the provided examples, the presence of the word ""walm"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow. For example, in the first input ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
