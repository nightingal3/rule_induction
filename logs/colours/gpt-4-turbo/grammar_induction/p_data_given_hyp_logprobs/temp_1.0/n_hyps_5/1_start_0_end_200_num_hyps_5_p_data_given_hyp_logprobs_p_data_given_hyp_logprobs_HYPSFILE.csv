"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

Input: zup walm wif

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

In each instance, the word ""walm"" is followed by a series of three words that correspond to a sequence of three colors, which are the same three colors in repetition. In the first and last examples, ""walm"" comes after the words ""zup"" and ""lug,"" which produce the outputs ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. Following ""walm,"" the sequence of colors repeats one of the colors that came before it three times. Specifically:

- After ""zup,"" we get three ""yellow"" instances.
- After ""lug,"" we get three ""blue"" instances.
- After ""dax,"" we get three ""green"" instances.

Additionally, the word following ""walm,"" if it is ""wif,"" results in ""red.""

Analyzing the pattern, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times, and if it is followed by ""wif,"" ""red"" is included as the next color in the sequence.

- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" except when preceded directly by ""walm.""
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" when used in ""walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" though in other positions, it seems to induce repetition of the color word that directly follows, except ""wif."" 

Here's how ""walm"" functions in each example:

- ""zup walm wif"" has ""walm"" influence the output of ""zup"" (yellow) before it translating to ""wif"" (red) - three yellows and then red.
- ""dax walm wif"" again induces the repetition of ""dax"" (green) - three greens and then red.
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is three blues. It's not followed by a color word, so it seems to repeat the color before it.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" makes ""walm"" repeat ""green"" and after the second ""walm"" repeat ""yellow.""
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" makes ""walm"" repeat the color of ""zup"" (yellow).

With these observations, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" it results in three repetitions of the color word before ""walm,"" followed by the color word for ""wif"" (red). When ""walm"" follows another color word, not followed directly by ""wif,"" it causes three repetitions of the preceding color word. ""Walm"" influences only the color word that directly follows or precedes it, not both.

"Given the examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" repeats the color yellow.
- In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" repeats the color green twice, once after each instance of ""dax"".
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" repeats the color blue.
- In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green, so it repeats green; the second ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" but since there is no direct association for ""wif,"" it might be that ""walm"" repeats the last color word, which is yellow for ""zup"".
- In ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" repeats the color yellow.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it. If ""walm"" follows a word without a color association, it repeats the last mentioned associated color.",-0.6273059995160607,0,walm
"To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns visible in each example:

In every instance of ""walm"" appears, the color ""yellow"" follows. However, yellow is not the only color that follows ""walm."" After considering the outputs, it appears that ""walm"" causes the subsequent word to be repeated in the output, generating additional outputs in the color corresponding to that word.

Let's break it down:

1. When ""zup"" is placed before ""walm,"" it results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. When ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" it results in ""blue blue.""
3. When ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" it results in ""green green green.""
4. When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" it results in ""red.""

Furthermore, when ""walm"" is not followed by any word (seen in the second input string), the last output color is blue, which is the color associated with ""lug."" This may indicate that in the absence of an immediate successor, ""walm"" defaults to the color or behavior prior to its appearance.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" acts as a repeater for the subsequent word's corresponding color. Considering that ""walm"" appears to be within a sequence and affects the output of the subsequent word, ""walm"" could be considered a function or a modifier that duplicates the output of the following word and represents it in its associated color.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" would be:

Rule: walm causes the next word's output to be repeated as per its corresponding color rule. If no word follows ""walm,"" the last mentioned color is repeated.

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   
   In this sequence, ""dax"" precedes a repetition of ""walm wif walm."" Each word corresponds to a color, and ""green"" is repeated three times at the start, where ""dax"" is mentioned. This might suggest ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   
   Here, ""dax"" occurs one time and is followed by ""green"" in the output. This backs up the initial observation from the first example.

3. Input: dax wif lug dax
   Output: green red blue green
   
   Again, ""dax"" appears twice and each occurrence aligns with ""green"" in the output.

4. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   
   ""Dax"" appears once at the start and aligns with ""green"" as before.

5. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

- When the only word in the input is ""wif,"" the output is a single color, red.
- When ""wif"" is used with other words, it consistently results in ""red"" being present in the output.
- No matter the position of ""wif"" within the input (beginning, middle, or end), ""red"" appears in the output.

Let's map the other words to their colors to see if there are any contradictions to the presumed rule that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"":

- ""zup"" = yellow
- ""bluf"" = yellow (first example) but = blue (second and fourth examples), which indicates ""bluf"" changes based on context.

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

5. Input: zup dax lug

In examples 1 through 4, the occurrence of ""dax"" correlates directly to the word ""green"" appearing in the output, indicating that ""dax"" likely means ""green"" when it appears first. In example 5, however, ""dax"" does not precede ""green"" but rather ""green"" appears right after ""dax,"" and ""zup"" which comes before ""dax"" is translated to ""yellow"".

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to correspond with the color ""green"" in the output. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input examples is followed by the word ""green"" in the output.

Here's the evidence supporting this rule:

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is likely to mean ""green"" as well since it precedes two instances of ""green"" in the output, and ""zup"" likely means ""yellow,"" as it is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax lug"" outputs ""green blue"", implying ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"" each time, suggesting ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""bluf"" might mean ""green"" as well or could be a repeat of ""green"" caused by ""dax.""
- The final example, ""zup dax lug,"" outputs ""yellow green blue."" From previous inferences, ""zup"" is correlated with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and corresponding output in each example to identify any patterns.

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""walm"" in this context also corresponds to green.

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""walm"" corresponds to yellow here.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green. ""walm"" is followed by two green outputs.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. Again, ""walm"" is followed by green.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" is new and also corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. ""walm"" is followed by red here.

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that follows it. Let's extract the rule:

- In Example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), hence the repeated green before the change to red.
- In Example 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), hence the repeated yellow before the eventual change.
- In Example 3, ""walm"" is followed by nothing, but given the pattern, it repeats the green from ""dax.""
- In Example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), hence the repeated green before it changes.
- In Example 5, ""walm"" is followed by nothing, so it repeats the color of ""wif"" (red).

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately succeeding word to be repeated. In cases where ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it repeats the color of the last word mentioned before itself.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the following word (or the last word before it if it is at the end).",-0.07951067437,2,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, the pattern that emerges for ""walm"" seems consistent across all scenarios. Each time the word ""walm"" appears, the output features a repetition of the color that directly follows the word ""walm"" in the input.

Here are some observations that lead to this conclusion:

1. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red,"" indicating that the word after ""walm"" (wif) corresponds to ""red"" and is repeated as a result of the word ""walm.""

2. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" leads to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue,"" demonstrating that after the word ""walm,"" the word ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") is repeated.

3. ""zup wif dax walm"" turns into ""yellow red green green green,"" showing that ""walm"" causes ""dax"" (corresponding to ""green"") to be repeated after it.

4. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" yields ""green green green yellow blue green,"" indicating ""walm"" triggers the repetition of ""zup"" (yellow).

5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats ""wif"" (red).

Based on these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the following word's color translation to be repeated in the output sequence.

Using this rule, ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the word that directly follows it should be repeated in sequence for the output.",-0.08744881877701033,2,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze its usage across the different examples and how it relates to the pattern of outputs. 

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
3. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
4. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

Firstly, it seems that every word except ""walm"" has a consistent color associated with it:
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, let's try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by comparing the input with its corresponding output.

In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which correlates to green. However, ""walm"" in the output is mapped to three consecutive greens, but since ""wif"" follows which is red, ""walm"" cannot simply mean ""green.""

In the second example, ""walm"" is followed only by ""wif,"" and in the output, ""walm"" is followed by three yellows, the same color as ""zup.""

In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and in the output, this translates to three greens here as well.

In the fourth example, again ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and once more, ""walm"" results in two extra occurrences of the green color after ""dax.""

In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and consequently, ""walm"" results in two extra occurrences of red in the output.

Considering these observations, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word just before it twice more.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word two times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word two additional times.",-0.09042013917717526,2,walm
"From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with the output that repeats the color corresponding to the previous word multiple times (specifically, three times for each occurrence of ""walm""). Each instance of ""walm"" is derived from the color associated with the word that precedes it:

- In Example 1, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" outputs ""green."" After ""walm,"" we have ""green green green.""
- In Example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is associated with the color ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In Example 3, ""walm"" again follows ""dax"" (green), and we get ""green green green.""
- In Example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), hence ""green green green.""
- In Example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red red red.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-1.1253061800044333,2,walm
"Observing the patterns in the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" is directly linked to repeating the output of the preceding word or phrase. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the output of ""walm"" after ""dax"" is ""green green green"" (repeating ""green"" three times).
- In the second input, no color is directly linked to ""walm"" since we have a sequence of words before it, but ""walm"" is followed by two instances of ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", and we see ""walm"" producing ""yellow yellow.""
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green green.""
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which produces ""green,"" and then ""walm"" leads to ""green green green"" (repeating ""green"" three times).
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red red.""

From these observations, the rule could be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word twice more in the output. However, there is an inconsistency in the second input, where ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup wif lug.""

Considering this, a more accurate rule might be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the last word before it for the number of times equal to the number of occurrences of that word before ""walm"" within the input sequence.

- In the second example, ""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red."" Here ""zup"" adds ""yellow"" before ""lug"" (blue), and ""bluf wif"" simply follows as ""blue red.""

- The third and fourth examples show that ""zup"" can repeat the sequence of colors mentioned before it in reverse order, with ""zup walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (the reverse of ""wif walm"" which gives ""red red"") and ""zup lug walm"" resulting in ""yellow blue blue blue"" (the reverse of ""lug walm"" which gives ""blue blue blue"").
  
- The fifth example, ""lug dax zup,"" translates to ""blue green yellow,"" suggesting that ""dax"" is associated with green and ""zup"" again adds ""yellow,"" following the previous colors in reverse order, but since ""blue"" has no reverse in the sequence provided, only ""yellow"" is added.

Therefore, zup -> adds the color sequence mentioned before it in reverse order, with the specific reverse color mapping being blue <-> yellow, red <-> red, green does not have a reverse mentioned.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can compare the input strings and their corresponding outputs to identify patterns associated with the use of ""walm."" Let's analyze the examples against the outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" However, after ""walm"" is introduced, ""wif"" still translates to ""red,"" but now it is proceeded by two extra ""blue"" tokens before it.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is followed by two additional ""blue"" tokens, likely corresponding to ""walm.""

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: We have ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow."" When ""walm"" is present, each time we see an additional occurrence of the color that precedes it, followed by the base color. So ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" and ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" 

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Analysis: We observe the repetition pattern associated with ""walm"" again, where the color prior to it appears three times in succession.

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   Analysis: Yet again, ""walm"" is followed by a triplet of the color word just before it and then continues with the base colors of the following words.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color word before it two additional times. 

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color word two additional times.",-0.06456881431829418,3,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the rules linking the nonce word ""walm"" to its meaning can be deduced by cross-referencing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. Here's the analysis:

1. Each time ""walm"" appears, the word that follows (if any) in the input does not change its associated color in the output. 
2. ""Walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it three times, assuming that ""lug"", ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""zup"" are associated with ""blue"", ""red"", ""green"", and ""yellow"" respectively and consistently.

So, according to the examples, ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word three times in the output:

- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"" which results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"" which leads to ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm"" producing ""red red red"", and later ""zup"" (yellow) precedes another ""walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""wif zup walm dax zup"", ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm"" again with ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"", ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm"" giving ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Therefore, based on the patterns observed in these examples, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.5171297404444999,3,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" we should examine the pattern in which it is used across the examples, paying particular attention to the corresponding outputs.

In the first example, the phrase ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" where ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"" elements to the sequence.

In the second example, the phrase ""lug walm"" translates directly to ""blue blue blue,"" which further corroborates the notion that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of ""blue.""

In the third example, the words ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translate to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Looking at the position of ""walm,"" it appears each time ""walm"" is mentioned, the previous color is repeated three times.

The fourth and fifth examples follow the same pattern, whereby the color word preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" is a function word that induces the repetition of the previous color word three times.

Rule: walm -> When immediately following a color word, repeat that color word three times.",-0.6150586735723529,3,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" generates a repeated sequence of colors, with the number of repetitions and the specific color being dependent on the word that precedes ""walm"". Here are the observations from each input/output pair:

1. When preceded by ""lug"" (blue), walm produces ""blue blue blue"".
2. When ""walm"" is directly after ""lug"", it again produces ""blue blue blue"".
3. When preceded by ""dax"" (green) and followed by ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" produces ""red red red"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" respectively.
4. When preceded by ""wif"" (red) or ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" regardless of the surrounding words.
5. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" (yellow), it leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", and when it bears ""lug"" (blue) before it, it gives ""blue yellow red"", showing influence from ""lug"".

The output patterns suggest that ""walm"" indicates a triplication of colors. Specifically:

- After ""lug"", ""walm"" results in the triplication of blue.
- After ""dax"" or ""wif"", ""walm"" results in the triplication of red.
- After ""zup"", ""walm"" results in the triplication of yellow.

However, the behavior described cannot be said to be consistent across all examples; it is possible that the rule might involve context-sensitive transformations that are not entirely clear with the given data. Nevertheless, within the confines of these examples, we can propose the following tentative rule:

Rule: ""walm"" following a color word repeats that color three times except when preceded by ""dax"" or ""wif"" where it creates three reds, and except when preceded by ""zup"" where it produces three yellows. 

Thus, based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" could be interpreted as:

walm -> repeat the preceding color three times, with special cases for ""dax"", ""wif"", and ""zup"".",-1.1014483479003923,3,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" consistently translates to a sequence of three of the same color in the output. If we match the inputs with their outputs, the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" seems to determine the color that is repeated three times.

For example:
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and the output is ""red red red.""
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule governing the word ""dax."" Let's examine each input and its corresponding output to identify any patterns:

1. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
2. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
3. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green
4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

By examining the inputs and outputs, we can identify the following:
- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"", as seen in the inputs and respective outputs where ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- The output for ""walm"" is not entirely clear from a single instance. However, considering the consistency of the other words, and that in the final example ""walm"" appears three times and is followed by ""yellow"" each time, it would suggest that ""walm"" may output to ""yellow,"" although additional context or examples would be needed to confirm this.

Considering the above deductions, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.1062287380709524,4,dax

- In the first and fourth examples, ""dax wif"" consistently translates to ""green red"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears twice and each time it is followed by the word ""wif"" or ""zup"" (three colors apart), ""dax"" translates to ""green"". Also, notice the repetition pattern in the output that matches the input (""zup dax"" is ""yellow green"").

   Analysis: The pattern is the same as the one before; ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated.

Based on the patterns above, ""walm"" seems to cause the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.08336779883810976,4,walm
"Observing the provided input-output pairs, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
4. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

Looking at the sequence of outputs corresponding to the inputs where walm is present, we notice that:

- The word before ""walm"" consistently repeats its color multiple times after the word walm. For instance:
  - In example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"", we have ""blue"" three more times.
  - In example 2, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", we have ""yellow"" two more times.
  - In example 5, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"", we have ""green"" two more times.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the given input and output examples. The goal is to find a consistency or a rule that explains how ""walm"" affects the output sequence.

Let's analyze each set of input/output:

1) lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
It seems that ""lug"" corresponds to ""red"" or ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" or ""blue."" ""Walm"" appears to cause the color to repeat (blue blue blue) before moving to the next color indicated by the next word.

2) zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and as in the previous case, ""walm"" causes the color to repeat (yellow yellow yellow).

3) wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
Once again, after ""walm"" appears, the previous color (blue) is repeated multiple times.

4) dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
The pattern remains consistent — after ""walm,"" the previous color (green) is repeated.

5) dax walm -> green green green
The single instance of ""dax"" before ""walm"" becomes repeated color output of ""green.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to make the previous color in the sequence repeat three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.10449761033290246,4,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" in this context, let's observe the patterns and their corresponding outputs:

1. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
2. zup walm                   -> yellow yellow yellow
3. wif lug walm               -> red blue blue blue
4. dax zup dax walm           -> green yellow green green green
5. dax walm                   -> green green green

Now, look for patterns before and after ""walm.""

In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""walm"" is followed by an output color sequence that starts with the same color repeatedly. In example 1, after ""walm dax,"" we get ""blue blue,"" and before ""walm,"" there is ""lug,"" which also corresponds to the color blue. Example 3 confirms this as ""lug"" also precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue."" In example 4, we have ""dax"" before and after ""walm,"" with a sequence of green following it. Example 5, with just ""dax walm,"" gives us ""green green,"" further reinforcing that the pattern holds even with a single word before ""walm.""

In example 2, ""zup walm"" gives us three yellows, but there is no color to compare before ""walm."" However, it matches the pattern of the repeated colors observed in the other examples.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, the output color is repeated three times, and the repeated color is determined by the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

So, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is to triple the output color associated with the word right before it.

From the examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it's either at the beginning or the end of a sequence. But, when it is followed by ""wif"", it corresponds to ""red"". 

Let's examine the sequences to deduce the rule:

1. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
   Here, ""dax"" at the beginning and the end of the sequence corresponds to ""green"". When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", it corresponds to ""red"".

2. dax bluf -> green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and there is no ""wif"" succeeding it.

3. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   In this sequence, ""dax"" is at the end and corresponds to ""green"". The ""wif"" preceding ""dax"" does not change its meaning here because ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"".

4. dax walm wif -> green green green red
   The first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". It's not at the end of the sequence or followed by ""wif"". The second occurrence of ""wif"" changes the color after it.

5. zup dax -> yellow green
   ""dax"" is at the end of the sequence and corresponds to ""green"".

With this information, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" by default but changes to ""red"" when directly followed by ""wif"".

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the provided examples and look for patterns that correspond to the word ""dax"" and its translated color output.

In the examples:

1. When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"" except the last ""dax"" which output is ""red"": 
   
   - dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green   
   
2. ""dax"" is followed by a different word, and the output is still ""green"":
   
   - dax bluf -> green green

3. ""dax"" is at the end of a sequence, following different words, and the output is ""green"":

   - zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

4. ""dax"" is followed by other words, and the initial ""dax"" translates to ""green"":
   
   - dax walm wif -> green green green red
   
5. ""dax"" follows another word, and it still translates to ""green"":
   
   - zup dax -> yellow green

The color ""green"" is consistently associated with ""dax"" except when ""dax"" appears at the end of a sequence, in which case the output color is ""red"".

Rule: Dax translates to the color ""green"" when it is not at the end of a sequence. If ""dax"" is the last word in the sequence, it translates to the color ""red"". 

Therefore, dax -> green (or red if it is the last word in the sequence).",-0.13407892077753086,5,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that each specific word corresponds to a particular color. Here is what we can deduce from the given inputs and outputs:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- The word ""wif"" always gives the output ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow.""
- ""Walm"" is consistently followed by the color ""yellow"" until it precedes ""zup wif dax"" where it switches to the output ""blue.""
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the one example where it's used.

Let's focus on the word ""dax."" In all instances of ""dax,"" regardless of position in the series of words, the output color is ""green."" There doesn't seem to be context dependency within the given examples for the meaning of ""dax."" Therefore, we can conclude:

3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
   ""walm"" repeatedly matches ""blue"" (from previous examples, but outputs ""red"" here), ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""wif"" appears at the beginning and aligns with ""red.""

4. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

From the examples, we can see the following:

- Whenever the input has ""wif,"" the corresponding output is ""red.""
- The word ""wif"" seems to change the output color of some words that follow it when compared to their standard output color in isolation or when ""wif"" doesn't precede them.

To deduce a rule for ""wif"":

- ""wif"" itself directly corresponds to the color ""red.""
- When ""wif"" precedes another color word, it changes its corresponding output to ""red."" This is clear with the word ""walm,"" which usually translates to ""blue"" but shifts to ""red"" when it directly follows ""wif.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow."" This implies ""wif"" does not change the output of every word that follows it.

Given these observations, the rule for ""wif"" can potentially be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and may change the following color word to ""red"" unless the word typically corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow

From analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can induce the following pattern:

- Every instance of ""wif"" outputs ""red.""

Applying this rule to the examples:

- In Example 1, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which results in ""red red.""
- In Example 2, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" which results in ""red green.""
- In Example 3, ""wif"" is the first word and ""walm"" follows, resulting in ""red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" also translates to ""red.""
- In Example 4, ""wif"" starts the input sequence followed by ""walm"" and results in two ""red"" in the output sequence.

- We don't see any variation in the output for ""wif"" irrespective of its position in the list or the other words around it.

"Analyzing the given examples, it's possible to deduce a pattern for the word ""walm"" as it relates to the output colors. Let's look at the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax wif walm

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm

   Here ""zup"" correlates to yellow. After the first ""walm,"" the preceding color (yellow) is repeated twice before changing to red once ""wif"" is encountered. Then, following the second ""walm,"" red is repeated twice.
   
3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif

   ""bluf"" correlates to green, and ""lug"" correlates to blue. After ""walm,"" red is repeated three times before meeting a new color word ""lug.""
   
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   
   After ""walm,"" green is repeated twice more which is the color associated with the preceding word ""dax."" This also shows that the repetition effect of ""walm"" ceases when a new color word is encountered.

The consistent rule that emerges is that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it (if that word has a color associated with it) multiple times until a new color word is encountered. Based on the given examples, it's not completely clear how many times the color should be repeated, but it seems to be depending on the presence of other color words.

"By examining the output patterns that follow each occurrence of the nonce word ""walm"" and the surrounding words, we can attempt to infer the meaning or rule associated with ""walm.""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Here's what we can observe:

- Every instance of ""walm"" is followed by colors in the output without any additional words in between.
- The color red seems to consistently appear following ""walm,"" often repeated multiple times.
- The number of reds that follow ""walm"" appears to correspond to something preceding ""walm.""

One potential rule might be that ""walm"" is associated with the color red and the number of times the color red appears corresponds to something related to the words before ""walm."" Comparing the examples:

1. ""wif"" appears once before ""walm,"" and there is one subsequent red in the output.
2. ""wif"" appears once before the second ""walm,"" resulting in one red, and no words appear before the first ""walm,"" resulting in no additional color output.
3. ""wif"" appears thrice before ""walm,"" leading to three reds in the output.
4. No word appears before ""walm,"" hence no additional reds are present.
5. ""dax"" appears once before ""walm,"" corresponding to one red in the output.

Given these observations, the rule could be related to the occurrence of specific words preceding ""walm"" and their frequency. In the provided examples, the word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is directly linked to the number of reds. However, this connection does not hold for ""dax"" and ""walm"" in the last example (as we would expect two greens if ""dax"" had the same effect). More examples or information is needed to define a precise rule.

Nevertheless, given the examples and the information provided, a tentative rule might be as follows:

Rule: walm -> the word ""walm"" results in the output of one or more reds. The number of reds might be connected to the frequency or presence of certain words appearing directly before ""walm,"" where ""wif"" before ""walm"" adds reds to the output based on its frequency of occurrence.",-0.06505494869754055,5,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider each instance of its use:

1. dax wif walm -> green red red red
2. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red

Now, let's look at the patterns before and after ""walm"":

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, there is a sequence of reds in the output.
- The number of reds following the word ""walm"" seems to be linked to the instances of the word ""wif"" following ""walm"". In examples 1, 2, and 5, where ""wif"" follows ""walm"", there are sequences of three reds. In example 3, where ""wif"" does not follow immediately but is later in the sequence, there are also reds, with an extra color (blue) before the red associated with the later ""wif"". In the 4th example, ""wif"" does not follow ""walm"" at all, and there are no reds after ""walm"".

From this, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> Induces a red for each instance of ""wif"" that follows it in the sequence without an interruption by a different word. If ""wif"" is not present immediately after ""walm,"" or is interrupted by another word, the sequence of reds may be later in the output or may not appear immediately.

Rule: walm induces a sequence of reds corresponding to the number of consecutive ""wif"" words that appear after it.",-0.1294175043776577,5,walm
"Observing the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" determines the repetition of the color that follows its associated word. For example, when associated with ""wif,"" which outputs the color red, ""walm"" then repeats this color for a certain number of times. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats red three additional times.
- In ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow two more times, and then ""wif"" is red followed by ""walm"" repeating red twice.
- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" ""wif"" is red and ""walm"" repeats red one more time.
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""lug"" is blue and ""walm"" repeats blue two more times.
- In ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" repeats green two more times.

The rule that can be derived from these examples is as follows:

Rule: walm causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated one fewer times than the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm"" (if the word is a color, otherwise the color immediately preceding walm). However, there is an exception in the first example, in which ""wif"" should only be repeated twice if we strictly follow this rule, but it's repeated thrice instead, indicating a potential inconsistency in the data or a special rule for the first occurrence.

Based on this analysis, the tentative rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word a number of times based on the immediate previous color word, with an exception or special condition that may affect the initial count.",-0.5125128132716937,5,walm
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the output that corresponds to its occurrence in the sequences provided:

1. In the first instance, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of the color red.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by three reds twice, and it appears after ""wif"" each time.
3. In the third sequence, ""walm"" follows two instances of ""wif"" and then is followed by three reds.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is not preceded by ""wif"" but is followed by three instances of the color blue.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by three greens.

Thus, the color output after ""walm"" seems to be affected by the word just before ""walm."" When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" red repeats three times. When other words precede ""walm,"" the output color corresponds to the noun immediately before ""walm"" repeated three times:

- ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in three greens.
- ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in three blues.
- ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in three reds.
- ""zup"" or any other words that don't have a clear direct color association, don't have immediate examples to infer the rule for their colors directly in these given instances.

This suggests ""walm"" itself does not signify a particular color, but rather a repetition of color three times based on the previous word's associated color. However, for a complete rule, we would need more examples, especially those with ""zup"" (and similar non-color-associated words) directly before ""walm,"" to determine how ""walm"" affects color output in those cases.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. If the previous word is ""wif,"" then the color is red. If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is green. If ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" the color is blue.",-1.1954206610912614,5,walm

1. In the first example, the input ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""green,"" since ""dax"" also translates to green.

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue."" Here, we know that ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" is blue. Since ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in red again, this could mean that ""bluf"" could mean to repeat the color of the preceding word.

3. In the third example, ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" translates to ""blue red red blue red."" Here, ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif,"" which is red, and the output is red, supporting the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" translates to ""red green red red yellow red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif"" (red), and the output is red again, which is consistent with the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" Again, ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax"" (green), and the output is green, which is in line with our rule.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. This means that the output for ""bluf"" should be the same color as the word that comes just before ""bluf.""",-0.10495786602017776,6,bluf
"Based on the above examples, we can attempt to deduce the pattern to define the meaning of the nonce word 'bluf.'

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green,"" implying that 'bluf' means 'green' since 'dax' translates to 'green' in the given output.
- The second example, ""wif bluf dax lug,"" translates to ""red red green blue."" Given that 'wif' stands for 'red,' 'dax' stands for 'green,' and 'lug' stands for 'blue,' 'bluf' also stands for 'red' here, which conflicts with the first conclusion.
- The third example, ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" becomes ""blue red red blue red."" It suggests that 'bluf' translates to 'red' again, consistent with the second example but not the first.
- The fourth example, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" translates to ""red green red red yellow red."" Here, 'zup' is 'yellow,' but 'bluf' is 'red,' consistent with the second and third examples but not the first.
- The fifth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" corresponds to ""blue red blue green green."" In this instance, 'bluf' translates to 'green,' which is consistent with the first example but not the others.

Based on these observations, 'bluf' does not have a consistent one-to-one word translation in the provided outputs. However, comparing examples one and five, which both yield 'green' for 'dax' and 'bluf,' provides a hint that:

Rule: 'bluf' repeats the color word immediately preceding it.

Therefore:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns associated with ""bluf"" and its related output. Let's analyze the examples to find the rule.

1. Whenever ""bluf"" is present, the term ""green"" is always part of the output.
2. The position of ""green"" in the output corresponds with the position of ""bluf"" in the input.
3. We observe that other words like ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" have consistent outputs: ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow.

To summarize the rule based on the given examples:

Rule: bluf corresponds to the color green in the output, and its position in the output sequence matches its position in the input sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> green",-0.9273176533363338,6,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze each example and look for patterns.

- In examples 1 and 3 (""lug walm"" and ""lug walm zup""), ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times. This suggests that when ""lug"" is present, ""walm"" might mean ""blue"" repeated as many times as there are words following ""lug.""

- In example 4 (""zup walm""), ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times, which could imply that ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it and repeats it the same number of times as there are words in the input.

- In example 2 (""lug dax walm""), ""walm"" follows ""lug dax,"" and the output is ""blue green green green."" This could mean ""walm"" is taking the colors associated with ""lug"" and ""dax"" (blue and green, respectively) and adding to the repetition by one.

- In example 5 (""lug dax walm wif""), ""walm"" follows ""lug dax"" again, and the output includes one new color ""red"" which is likely from ""wif."" The pattern of repeating the colors associated with the preceding words continues, with an additional repetition of ""green"" for ""dax.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:
""walm"" repeats the sequence of colors associated with the preceding words. It starts by repeating the color of the first word before it, then continues with the next, adding an extra repetition for each subsequent word. If ""walm"" stands alone (after one word), it repeats that color three times.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:
Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with each word immediately before ""walm"" in the sequence, beginning with three repetitions for the first word and adding one additional repetition for each word present before ""walm,"" except for the word directly before ""walm,"" which sets the color.",-0.3271036155747223,6,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word or phrase the same number of times as there are letters in the preceding word or phrase. 

For example:
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" has three letters and its color is blue.
- ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green"" because ""dax"" has three letters and its color is green.
- ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow"" because ""walm"" follows the rule associated with ""lug,"" resulting in three blues, and ""zup"" adds a yellow at the end.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Each example shows that no matter the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence, the output is always ""green"" when the term ""dax"" is present. Meanwhile, other words like ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" seem to correspond to different colors (""red,"" ""green,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively), and their positions do not appear to influence their output.

As ""dax"" is a nonce word (a made-up word without a previously defined meaning), we are determining its meaning strictly based on its context within the examples. The consistent output of ""green"" whenever ""dax"" appears indicates a rule that the presence of ""dax"" leads directly to the output of ""green.""

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" and ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

1. When the input is simply ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
2. When ""dax"" is appended to ""wif,"" as in ""wif dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
3. The last example shows that when ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" as in ""wif lug,"" the output pairs ""red blue.""

Using just the given examples, we can infer that ""wif"" by itself corresponds to ""red."" The output changes when ""wif"" is combined with other words, which suggests that ""wif"" could be a modifier that takes on additional properties when combined or may indicate that other words have their own corresponding colors that output in sequence following ""wif."" However, the examples are not sufficient to deduce a more complex pattern for when ""wif"" is in combination with other words, but we can confidently associate ""wif"" by itself with a single color.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to determine the pattern of how input words correspond to output colors. Observing each example:

1. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to 'green,' and when ""zup"" follows, we get 'yellow.'

2. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

""dax"" again corresponds to 'green,' ""walm"" also corresponds to 'green,' and ""wif"" gives us 'red.' After all these, ""zup"" adds a 'yellow.'

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

""zup"" is the first word and corresponds to 'yellow,' and ""bluf"" seems to also correspond to 'yellow.'

4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

Here ""zup"" is followed by 'yellow,' ""wif"" by 'red,' and ""bluf"" again by 'red.'

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

""zup"" starts with 'yellow,' ""dax"" is 'green,' ""walm"" is 'green,' ""lug"" appears for the first time, and it is 'blue,' and finally, ""wif"" is 'red.'

Based on these examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow.' So the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Therefore:
zup -> yellow",-0.08248710141051284,7,zup
"Based on the examples provided and examining the context in which ""zup"" is used, we can attempt to deduce the rule governing its meaning. However, since the examples do not provide a clear pattern for individual translations of the non-nonce words like ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" we will focus specifically on the occurrences of ""zup.""

In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the word that follows it (if there is one) and ""zup"" itself result in ""yellow"" being included in the output. If ""zup"" is at the beginning of the input, the word following it also is represented as ""yellow"" in the output, like in the third and fourth examples: ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"" and ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red"".

Notice that whenever ""zup"" is included, it corresponds to a ""yellow"" in the output sequence. This happens regardless of its position in the input sequence, be it at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end.

Following another observation, when ""zup"" precedes another word, that word is translated based on some unknown rule, as evidenced by ""bluf"" variously translating to ""yellow"" and ""red"" depending on its position relative to ""zup"" and other words.

Rule:
zup -> ""yellow""

This rule dictates that the presence of ""zup"" in the input corresponds directly to ""yellow"" in the output, and it may also affect the interpretation of the word that immediately follows it if there is one. However, further examples with consistent translation of other words would be necessary to fully understand the complete rules governing this language.",-0.8472257710467949,7,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the consistent patterns in the given examples:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is outputted. 
- The appearance of ""walm"" leads to ""green"" in the output.
- The presence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- The term ""bluf"" is associated with ""yellow"" in the first instance and with ""red"" in the second instance.
- ""lug"" seems to correspond with ""blue.""

Note that in every input, regardless of position or other words, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" in the output. It seems independent of other words and maintains this same output consistently.

Based on this, the rule for ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: zup consistently translates to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input.",-0.9095309650217948,7,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" one must look for patterns within the input-output pairs provided. Here's the pattern analysis:

- When ""zup"" appears after ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" the resulting output is ""yellow"" following the ""green.""
- When ""zup"" appears before ""bluf,"" which outputs two ""yellow,"" the output is a string of ""yellow"" colors equal to the number of words input.
- When ""wif"" (which outputs ""red"") is used with ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""red.""
- When multiple words precede ""zup,"" the output sequence starts with ""yellow,"" followed by the associated colors of the words before ""zup.""
- When ""zup"" precedes words like ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""wif,"" it outputs ""yellow"" first, followed by the sequence of colors linked to each subsequent word.

Amongst each example, ""zup"" is consistently associated with the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position and the words surrounding it.

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule appears to be:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" or ""red"", depending on its position relative to ""wif"" (the presence of ""wif"" after ""bluf"" suggests ""red"" might be a modifier or consequence of the combination, rather than the inherent meaning of ""bluf""). The meaning of ""bluf"" is inconsistent based only on the given data, but what is clear is that ""bluf"" is not interchangeable with ""zup"" despite both yielding ""yellow"" in their first occurrence.

Given this information, the meaning we can assign to ""zup"" with the current data is:

From these examples, it is clear that whenever ""bluf"" is included in the input, ""red"" is the resulting color in the output. There is one discrepancy with example 3 where ""zup"" seems to override the expected ""red"" output as it is always followed by ""yellow"". This suggests that ""bluf"" may mean ""red,"" but its effect can be overridden if a specific word follows it (such as ""zup"").

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relation between the input words and the colors in the output. We will look for patterns of when ""walm"" appears and the colors that follow it.

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the following colors are red.

- wif walm -> red red red
- zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
- lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the following color is also red, except for the one case where ""wif"" follows ""zup walm"" and it is yellow.

- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red

- dax walm -> green green green
- zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
- lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

4. ""walm"" consistently results in the same color either repeating three times (in the case when it's the second word) or makes the following color be red when it does not repeat the previous color. This would suggest that ""walm"" acts as a sort of repeater or intensifier for the previous word's associated color, or as a reset to red if it is incompatible with this rule.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the same color for the word preceding it three times. If the word that precedes ""walm"" is incompatible with repeating three times, it defaults to red.

- ""zup dax walm"" correlates with ""yellow green green.""
- ""lug wif dax walm"" correlates with ""blue red green green.""

In the outputs after ""walm,"" the color corresponds to the color of the previous word, repeated three times. This suggests that ""walm"" causes the next word's color to be repeated three times.

3. After ""zup,"" the word ""walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup dax,"" it results in ""green,"" just as ""dax"" does.
5. When placed after ""lug wif,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" yields ""green"" as well.

It seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it, with that color said three times. Here's the induction of the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it three times. For example, if the preceding word is associated with the color red, ""walm"" would mean ""red red red."" If the preceding word is associated with the color green, ""walm"" would mean ""green green green,"" and so forth.

Based on the patterns observed in the outputs, here is the breakdown:

- ""wif"" appears to be associated with red.
- ""dax"" appears to be associated with green.
- ""zup"" appears to be associated with yellow.
- ""lug"" appears to be associated with blue.

- ""zup"" outputs ""yellow""
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue""

It's also noticeable that there is no direct color output associated with ""walm;"" instead, ""walm"" seems to cause the word following it to repeat its color output three times.

- In the first input: ""walm dax"" results in ""green green green.""

2. The color that seems to correspond specifically to ""walm"" itself is always ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can form a rule:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the last mentioned color
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red""

When we look at the pattern in which the word ""wif"" appears and the output that follows, we notice:

- In the first example, after ""wif"" follows ""dax"", and ""red"" precedes ""green"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is directly followed by ""walm"", and the output is ""red"" followed by another ""red"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and is followed by ""red"" in both instances.

- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and then another ""wif"" followed by ""dax"", with the output being ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""green"".

It appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" every time it is used. There is no context-dependent rule that alters the meaning of ""wif"" in the examples provided; it consistently equates to ""red"" regardless of what follows.

Hence, the meaning is:
wif -> red",-0.7896038548909902,8,wif
"Analyzing the examples provided, I will now examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif.""

1. In the first example, the word ""wif"" appears between ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. After ""wif"" comes ""dax,"" which leads to ""red green."" So, ""wif"" here has resulted in the color red appearing in the output sequence before ""dax.""

2. In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" which corresponds to blue. Here, ""wif"" leads to a sequence of reds with the same number of reds as there are ""walm""s following it until the next non-""walm"" word.

3. In the third example, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and is followed by ""bluf"" which does not appear in the other examples. However, ""wif"" still leads to the color red, suggesting that the ""wif"" influences the color red regardless of the following word.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" again and leads to a ""red red"" output. This echoes the same pattern as in the other examples.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears twice and both times it results in red appearing in the output, once at the beginning and once in the middle before ""dax,"" which then results in ""green.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be:
 
Rule: ""wif"" results in the color red appearing in the output sequence, and if ""wif"" is followed by a word that has a corresponding color, that color appears immediately after the red; when ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the number of reds in the sequence matches the number of subsequent ""walm"" words.

Thus the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

"Based on the given examples, one can observe the following:

- Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output sequence.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input determines the position of ""red"" in the output.
- Other words in the input correspond to their own unique color in the output that does not change based on the presence of ""wif"".
- ""Wif"" does not seem to affect the color associated with other nonce words around it. For example, ""zup"" always corresponds to yellow, regardless of whether ""wif"" is before or after it in the input.

Rule:
wif -> red",-1.425692397931683,8,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each example to understand its position and corresponding output color.

In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds with the color blue.

In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" which is red, thus ""wif"" could be functioning as a modifier changing ""walm"" to red.

In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds with red, but it's followed by ""bluf"", which is also red.

In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" again, with both corresponding to the color red.

In the last example, ""wif"" appears twice and both times it corresponds with the color red.

By examining all the examples given, the rule seems consistent for ""wif"" except for the first example, where it correlates with blue. To reconcile this, let's hypothesize that ""wif"" might have changed the color due to its position or surrounding words.

However, given that in all other instances ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and considering the first instance might be an anomaly or have additional rules, the basic rule for ""wif"" is as follows:

2. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""red red yellow yellow red"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"" and then repeats the color of ""zup"". The last ""wif"" stands alone without a following ""bluf"", so its color is not repeated.

- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"". The word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"", following the word ""dax"".
- In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" following ""wif"", and to ""yellow"" following ""zup"".
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"".
- In ""wif bluf dax"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"", while ""dax"" is translated separately as ""green"".
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows a sequence of colors where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". The word ""bluf"" is placed after ""lug"" and is translated as ""blue"" twice, keeping the pattern consistent.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-1.2224974828679491,8,bluf

- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output color is ""green.""
- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output color is ""red.""
- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output color is ""blue.""

It's important to note that if ""bluf"" repeats, the associated color of the preceding word also repeats in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be replicating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.",-1.2770885228232054,8,bluf

4. Input: wif dax lug walm

5. Input: wif walm dax zup

- In example 2, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" following which ""walm"" leads to ""red.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and then ""walm"" produces ""green.""
- In example 4, ""lug"" is represented by ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" results in additional ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

- In the first example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" It is not immediately clear which word corresponds to ""walm,"" but every color is mentioned twice except for ""red"" which is only mentioned once.
  
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""red"" appears three times, which is more than any other color.

- In the third example, ""lug dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green green green red."" Similar to the previous example, ""green"" is repeated three times.

- In the fourth example, ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue."" Once again, ""blue"" appears three times.

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" Like before, one color (""red"") is repeated three times.

Upon inspecting the examples, we notice that the output color corresponding to ""walm"" is repeated three times in each case. Therefore, we can deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes just before it in the sequence three times.

"To infer the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the correspondences between the input and the output color patterns.

Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output color pattern starts with ""red"" and repeats ""red"" for the position of ""walm.""
   - Example: ""wif walm"" -> ""red red""

2. When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output color pattern starts with ""blue"" and repeats ""blue"" for the position of ""walm.""
   - Example: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue""

3. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color pattern includes ""green"" before ""walm,"" and then it repeats ""blue"" for the position of ""walm.""
   - Example: ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue""

4. ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the preceding word's corresponding color, if that word has a corresponding color.

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" takes the value of the color associated with the preceding word in the input string.

Rule: walm -> the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the series. If the preceding word corresponds to ""red,"" then ""walm"" is red. If the preceding word corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" is yellow. If the preceding word corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" is blue. If the preceding word corresponds to ""green,"" then ""walm"" is green.",-1.0310001535196773,8,walm
"From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" induces the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. This is evident since, in every output, the color that follows ""walm"" is the same as the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""walm."" Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color blue is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color blue is repeated once after ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color green is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color blue is repeated twice after ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the color red is repeated twice after ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-1.048188678088602,8,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns associated with the output colors.

- In the first input, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" while ""lug"" alone leads to a single blue in the other examples. This indicates that ""walm"" might be a doubling or repetition rule for the color that precedes it.
  
- In the second input, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" and usually, ""wif"" on its own corresponds to a single red. This supports the repetition hypothesis.
  
- In the third and fourth inputs, ""walm"" again follows colors and leads to them being repeated twice more.

- The fifth input shows ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red,"" thus conforming with our earlier observation.

Looking at these patterns, we can conclude a potential rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats the color that immediately precedes it two more times.

Other words like ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" seem to produce outputs independent of the presence of ""dax,"" since in the third example, ""walm"" and ""wif"" both produce ""green,"" while ""bluf"" produces ""red."" Meanwhile, in the fifth example, ""wif"" yields ""red,"" and ""bluf"" yields ""yellow."" However, ""zup"" consistently yields ""yellow"" in both the first and fifth examples.

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and before ""dax,"" which would ordinarily be ""green."" But in this instance ""dax"" is shown as ""red,"" hinting that ""bluf"" might switch the color of the following word, except it doesn't line up with observation 1.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") and is again followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red."" Here ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which might support it changing the color of the following word, but it still conflicts with the first example.
5. The fifth example is the most revealing. ""Bluf"" appears at the end, after ""dax"" (green), yet the last ""wif"" is not ""red"" (as we would expect if ""bluf"" changes colors) but ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" directly correlates to ""green"" here, not altering the color of any adjacent words.

Based on these observations, there seems to be a contradiction or missing information. The ""bluf"" word appears to change its meaning contextually, which is not consistent across all examples. Let's analyze one last time by laying out the pairs:

1. wif bluf -> red red (bluf could be red, especially if ""wif"" also means ""red"")
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf could be yellow, but then why not red as in example 1?)
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green (bluf could mean ""the next word should be red if possible"")
4. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red (could possibly align with the rule from example 3)
5. dax bluf wif -> green green red (also aligns with the rule from example 3)

Based on the rule induced from examples 3, 4, and 5, ""bluf"" might mean ""make the following word red, if possible."" However, the available data is insufficient to confirm this rule with certainty. Therefore, the best induced rule with the given data, assuming examples 1 and 2 might contain errors, anomalies, or missing context, is:

Rule: bluf -> the following word should be red, if possible.",-1.1124303383246552,9,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" I will look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by the word ""wif."" The sequence ""bluf wif"" correlates with the output ""green red,"" while ""bluf"" on its own corresponds with the color ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug walm,"" and the output is ""yellow blue blue.""

3. In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is either followed by ""dax"" or precedes it, and in both cases, the part of the output corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""red.""

4. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is at the end, preceding a ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""

After examining the patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" is not tied to a static color output but rather depends on its position and neighboring words. The most consistent pattern is that when ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is green before the color representing ""wif"" (which seems to be consistently red). In other positions, ""bluf"" corresponds to red or green, but there isn't enough consistent information to determine a rule for those positions. However, the sample size and context are limited, making it difficult to extract a definite rule for all occurrences of ""bluf.""

Based on the provided data, here's an attempted rule induction for ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""wif,"" it corresponds with the color green; otherwise, it may correspond with the color red or green, likely influenced by other contextual factors not immediately discernible from the examples provided.

Bluf -> meaning:
When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it means green. In other contexts, it may vary between red and green, with the specific rule for this variation unclear due to insufficient data.",-1.204732004747845,9,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the association between the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the instances where ""bluf"" appears:

1. Input: (wif bluf) Output: (red red)
2. Input: (dax bluf) Output: (green green)
3. Input: (zup bluf) Output: (yellow yellow)

From these examples, we observe that whenever ""bluf"" occurs after another word, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word:
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-1.2069196721508624,9,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each word corresponds to a color.

Let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is between two instances of ""wif"" and also occurs after ""dax"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". In this context, ""bluf"" leads to ""red"" and ""green"" in the output, specifically following the color ""green"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"". The output following ""bluf"" is ""yellow blue"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" surround ""dax"" leading to ""red red green"" in the output, with ""bluf"" being associated with ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output is ""yellow red"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is after ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", the output for ""bluf"" here is ""green"".

The color that appears associated with ""bluf"", regardless of its position relative to other words, is consistently ""green"". This suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given context. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> green",-1.2796372738070687,9,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the input and output sequences. Observing the patterns, we see that every time ""walm"" is mentioned, a sequence of the same color repeats in the output, with the number of repetitions apparently linked to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Here ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" Again, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" The first ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times, and the second occurrence of ""walm"" also follows ""lug,"" hence ""blue"" is again repeated three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

From these observations, we can discern a pattern: ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the preceding word to be outputted multiple times. Additionally, the number of times the color is repeated seems consistent at three, regardless of which word precedes ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding itself to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.08347563106879119,9,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it for as many times as there are letters in the word ""walm"".

Let's go through the examples provided to validate this rule:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   The color 'yellow' associated with 'zup' is repeated three times (the number of letters in 'walm').

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   The color 'green' associated with 'dax' is repeated three times.

3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif

   The color 'yellow' (from 'zup') is repeated three times, followed by the other colors in sequence.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   The color 'blue' (from 'lug') is repeated three times, then after 'zup' ('yellow'), 'lug' occurs again followed by 'blue' repeated three times.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   The color 'red' (from 'wif') is repeated three times.

Therefore:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color word that precedes it. Here is the analysis:

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" which denotes ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which denotes ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.

3. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" After ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times. ""Walm"" does not follow ""dax"" here so we do not see a repetition after ""dax.""

4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") twice, and in both cases ""blue"" is repeated three times.

5. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

So the general rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it means that color is repeated three times.

Therefore: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",-0.0917754990152198,9,walm

3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

Analyzing the patterns:

- In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" between ""lug"" (blue) and another ""lug"" results in a sequence of three ""yellow"" between the two ""blue."" So, ""walm"" appears to be repeating the color corresponding to the word before it.
  
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is three ""green"" in a row.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and results in three ""yellow"" before another color comes up.

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow). The output is three ""blue"" after the first ""lug,"" then ""yellow"" follows ""zup,"" and the pattern continues.

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output is three ""red"" in a row.

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it results in three consecutive outputs of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" creates a repetition of the prior color three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" two more times.

From the second example:

Observations:
1. Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

We see ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" ""walm"" is also translated to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates into ""yellow"" here.

2. Input: zup walm

In this example, regardless of the position of ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow"" at the start, and ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" rather than ""blue,"" as seen in the previous example. This suggests that ""zup"" may influence the color attributed to ""walm.""

3. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Here, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" However, after ""zup,"" ""lug"" still translates to ""blue."" This suggests that ""zup"" has no effect on ""lug,"" but ""walm"" might be influenced since ""wif"" follows it with ""yellow"" and not ""blue.""

4. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif

In this input/output pair, we notice that ""zup"" is again followed by ""yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" might indeed correspond to ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug zup

Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup,"" and as we've seen before ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates into ""yellow."" 

From the above analysis, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. However, its presence doesn't alter the output of other words that have consistently mapped outputs (""lug"" is always ""blue,"" ""wif"" is always ""red""), yet it may influence the output of ""walm"" which changes output based on its presence.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns and relationships in the given examples.

In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" is followed by three yellow outputs.

In the second example, ""zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" alone is followed by three yellows again.

In the third example, ""lug walm zup,"" ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""lug,"" which produces blue outputs, but ""walm"" itself is followed by one yellow, which deviates from the three-yellows pattern we initially saw.

In the fourth example, ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again, and this time ""walm"" is followed by three blue outputs and no yellow, which is entirely different from the patterns we saw before.

In the fifth example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows the sequence ""zup lug zup"" and is followed by three yellows, which is again a different pattern.

Upon observing these examples, it is challenging to find a single consistent meaning for ""walm"" since its output colors depend on the context of the preceding word(s). However, there is one consistency: the color following ""walm"" is always the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" we see yellow as the output, just like ""zup"" on its own. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it is followed by blue outputs, the same color associated with ""lug.""

Hence, ""walm"" appears to take on the color of the preceding word in the sequence. However, this rule does not explain why in some cases ""walm"" is followed by a triplet of the same color, while in other cases it's a single color. There might not be enough context to fully understand this aspect of the pattern.

The rule can be summarized as follows:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word in the output as many times as ""walm"" occurs.

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green
3. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue

Looking closely, we can notice the following patterns:

- In all examples where ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" is also present in the output. 
- ""Wif"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that directly follows it. For example:
  - In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" so when ""wif bluf"" is present together, the output is ""red red.""
  - In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well. When ""wif"" is next to ""zup,"" the output is ""red yellow,"" indicating that ""wif"" takes the color of ""zup"" which is the word after ""wif"".
  - In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" When it's ""lug wif lug,"" the output is ""blue red blue,"" indicating that ""wif"" takes on the color of ""lug"" that follows it directly.

- The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" unless it is preceded by ""wif,"" in which case the translation becomes ""red.""
- ""wif"" seems to modify the color translated from the word that follows it, changing it to ""red.""

Examining the examples:

1. wif bluf -> red red (bluf is normally yellow but here it is red)
2. zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green (""wif"" follows ""zup,"" but affects ""lug,"" which would have been blue if not for ""wif."")
3. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow (""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" but since ""zup"" is not a color word, ""wif"" affects ""bluf,"" turning it from its usual yellow to red.)
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (""bluf"" is yellow, but ""wif walm"" translates to red red red, indicating that ""wif"" here affects a sequence rather than a single word.)
5. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue (The first ""lug"" is blue, the next ""wif lug"" translates to red blue, and the subsequent ""bluf,"" unaffected by ""wif,"" is blue.)

Given these patterns, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" changes the color translation of the subsequent word to ""red.""

"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we should examine the consistent pattern across the given examples with their respective outputs.

Input: zup wif walm  
Output: yellow red red red

The output for ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and given the three reds subsequent to ""wif walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" repeated the color of the word before it.

Input: lug walm wif lug  
Output: blue blue blue red blue

The output for ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. Between the two ""lug"" words, we have ""walm wif,"" which corresponds to blue blue followed by red. It reinforces the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

Input: dax walm wif bluf  
Output: green green green red red

The output for ""dax"" is green and ""wif"" is red. After repeating the color for ""dax walm,"" ""wif"" changes the color to red.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif  
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Following the rule deduced above, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" after ""lug"" becomes blue, ""zup"" changes the color to yellow, and ""wif"" follows as red.

Input: dax walm  
Output: green green green

Here, following ""dax"" with green, ""walm"" repeats green twice, which aligns with the established pattern.

So, based on the pattern across the examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to correlate with repetition. Specifically:

Rule: walm -> meaning: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word directly before it thrice.",-0.07497089635717645,11,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns between the input and output strings. We can start by identifying consistent correlations between known words and colors:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"".
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"".
- ""bluf"" is not present in all examples, but ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"" when it appears with ""wif"".

Now, let's focus on the occurrences of ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"". Since ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", the ""walm"" in this context might be adding two additional ""red"".
2. ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue"". Here, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red"". Since we have an additional ""blue"" at the beginning and an additional ""red"" in the middle, ""walm"" could be correlating with two extra ""blue"" in this context.
3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red"". Since ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""bluf"" is also ""red"", the ""walm"" here might correlate with two extra ""green"".
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". We can see that ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""wif"" is ""red"". The word ""walm"" here produces two extra ""blue"".
5. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". Knowing that ""dax"" is ""green"", ""walm"" in this context correlates with two extra ""green"".

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" generates two additional colors identical to the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, when placed after a color word, the effect of ""walm"" is to repeat that color word two more times in the output.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.",-0.10834159004065878,11,walm
"Observing the provided examples, we can derive a pattern for what ""walm"" means based on the words that precede it and the color outputs it generates.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
4. When ""walm"" is the only word after ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times, which confirms the rule from example 3.
5. When ""walm"" follows multiple colors such as ""dax lug,"" both ""green"" and ""blue"" are repeated, in the sequence of their appearance before ""walm,"" followed by the colors associated with the words after ""walm.""

From the above analysis, we can deduce that ""walm"" appears to cause the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, repeated three times. When there is no preceding word, such as in example 5, no color is repeated.

So it seems 'wif' by itself causes the first part of the output to be 'red', and it dictates the color that follows based on the word that comes immediately after 'wif'. If the word is 'bluf', it adds another 'red'; if the word is 'lug', it adds a 'blue'.

If we were to summarize the meaning based on these examples alone, with the specific relationship to the preceding word remaining unclear but acknowledging that ""bluf"" represents a color, the meaning could be deduced as:

bluf -> color",-0.12053005263684503,12,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following:

1. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the single occurrence of ""blue"" in the output.
2. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", which means that ""bluf"" here again corresponds to ""green,"" which is the repetitive color in the output.
3. ""dax wif bluf"" gives us ""green red red,"" and ""wif bluf"" by itself also translates to ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""wif.""

Given the last two points, ""bluf"" seems to change meaning depending on its context, whether it follows ""dax"" or ""wif."" However, in the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds directly to ""blue.""

Since ""bluf"" changes color meaning depending on the words that precede it, let's lay down a general rule that seems to apply:

- When the word ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green.""
- When it directly follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""
- In the absence of ""dax"" or ""wif"" before ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""blue,"" as seen in the first example where it is placed between ""lug"" and ""zup,"" which don't seem to affect its meaning.

So, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""blue"" by default, ""green"" when preceded by ""dax,"" and ""red"" when preceded by ""wif.""",-0.32871260514352113,12,bluf
"Observing the provided examples, we can infer the following:

In examples where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" in this context translates to ""red."" 

However, in the example where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating that in this case, ""bluf"" means ""green.""

When ""bluf"" is in a sequence that starts with ""zup,"" then ""lug,"" followed by another ""zup,"" and then ""walm,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue."" This is the only instance where ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" and it occurs within a specific sequence of other nonce words.

Combining these observations, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it, meaning that it has no inherent color by itself but reflects the color associated with the previous word. If preceded by ""dax,"" it outputs ""green,"" and if preceded by ""wif,"" it outputs ""red."" In the sequence given in the first example, ""bluf"" has output ""blue,"" possibly due to the unique combination of surrounding words.

Thus:

bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the context, specifically the word that comes directly before it.",-0.9045624908915492,12,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the colors outputted in correlation with the presence of ""bluf"" and other words:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""zup,"" the color blue is outputted.
- When ""bluf"" is on its own immediately after ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the color red is outputted.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" or ""dax"" without any other words following or preceding those combinations, the color green is outputted.

Given this information, it seems that ""bluf"" itself may not have a fixed color meaning but rather depends on the context of the words around it. The rule seems to hinge on what words come before ""bluf.""

From the examples we have:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the resulting color is yellow, except when ""lug"" is also in the sequence right before ""bluf,"" which gives blue. This suggests that ""lug"" might have a unique interaction with ""bluf,"" resulting in the color blue.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output color is red.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" alone, the output color is green.

Therefore, ""bluf"" does not represent a fixed color but rather indicates that the output color should be determined by the preceding word according to the above-stated rules.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word preceding it in the sequence and the color it dictates: ""zup"" generally leads to yellow (but can lead to blue if ""lug"" precedes ""bluf""), ""wif"" leads to red, and ""dax"" leads to green.",-1.1155034440323945,12,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each input word corresponds with a color in the output. The word 'bluf' consistently yields the color 'blue'. Therefore:

bluf -> blue

Rule: Whenever 'bluf' appears in the input, the output is 'blue'.",-1.7464759792295774,12,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

By comparing the inputs with their outputs, we can try to determine the pattern for ""walm"" and other words:

- The word ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""

Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output shows a repetition of the color that maps to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Now let's apply this rule to ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output shows ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" might represent a repetition of the last color mentioned, which is three times ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and therefore ""walm"" leads to three times ""green.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" again, which leads to three times ""green"" after ""green"" once for ""dax,"" meaning ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of the last mentioned color.
- In example 4, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" which results in ""red red red.""
- In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Given the consistent pattern that ""walm"" results in a thrice repetition of the last color stated, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: Walm -> Causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.",-0.09201199266390798,12,walm
"Observing the examples given:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

The color that follows each word seems to correspond to the word's position relative to the word ""walm."" It appears that ""walm"" changes the output colors to be based on the last color that appeared before it and repeats that color multiple times relating to the number of words following it. Let's consider each case:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" would repeat the color that came before it (""blue"") the number of times that correspond to the number of words that come after it (in this case, zero words after ""walm"", hence three ""blue"" colors for the three ""walm"").

2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" repeating the color ""green"" from ""dax,"" three times due to zero words following ""walm"".

3. ""dax walm lug"" yields ""green green green blue,"" meaning ""walm"" repeated ""green"" from ""dax"" three times, since there is one word after ""walm"" (""lug"").

4. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" where ""walm"" repeated ""red"" from ""wif"" three times with zero words following it.

5. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" echoing the pattern where ""walm"" repeated the color ""yellow"" from ""zup"" three times due to the words following it (""wif lug"").

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the last color before it to be repeated a number of times based on the number of words that come after ""walm,"" plus two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color output before ""walm"" an amount of times equal to the number of words following ""walm"" in the sequence plus two additional times.",-0.1000872356325977,12,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it three times. To verify this rule, let's analyze the examples:

1. ""wif lug walm"" yields ""red blue blue blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" three times.

2. ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" three times.

3. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" yields ""yellow red green green green blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" three times.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

4. ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color for ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" three times.

5. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" yields ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color for ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" three times.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.10344196584413794,12,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the sequences of inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- When ""lug"" follows ""wif"" before ""walm,"" the output is 'blue' but repeating the sequence ('wif lug') after ""walm"" seems to repeat the color sequence that follows directly after 'walm' as seen in the last example. There's a repetition of 'yellow' three times which correlates with the presence of ""zup"" before ""walm"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three greens.
- When ""zup  wif"" precede ""walm,"" the output is three reds.
- When ""zup wif dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three greens following a yellow and a red.
- ""wif"" always corresponds with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

From the above observations, ""walm"" seems to function as a rule that instructs us to repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding nonce word a variable number of times. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of nonce words between ""walm"" and the nearest preceding ""zup,"" inclusive of ""zup."" If there isn't a ""zup,"" then the repetition is of the color corresponding to the nonce word immediately before ""walm.""

Let's apply this rule to construct the meaning:

- Input: wif lug walm - Output: red blue blue blue - ""walm"" repeats the color for 'lug' (blue) since there is no ""zup"".
- Input: dax walm - Output: green green green - ""walm"" repeats the color for 'dax' (green) since there is no ""zup"".
- Input: zup wif dax walm lug - Output: yellow red green green green blue - ""zup"" is the nearest preceding word to ""walm,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color for 'dax' (green) three times because there are three words between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" inclusive of ""zup.""
- Input: zup wif walm - Output: yellow red red red - ""walm"" repeats the color for 'wif' (red) since that is the word before ""walm,"" and there are two words between ""zup"" and ""walm"" inclusive of ""zup.""
- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug - Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue - ""walm"" repeats the color for 'zup' (yellow) one time (since ""zup"" is immediately before ""walm""), but since there's another sequence after ""walm,"" it continues with yellow to represent the words ""wif lug"" after ""walm.""

Based on this analysis:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the nonce word immediately preceding ""walm,"" the number of times equal to the total number of words from ""zup"" to ""walm"" inclusive of both. If there is no ""zup,"" repeat the color corresponding to the nonce word immediately before ""walm"" once.",-0.10354386970765518,12,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the patterns of input and outputs provided. The pattern suggests that the output colors are not dependent on any fixed color for any specific nonce word, but rather on the number of times a nonce word appears and possibly its position in the sequence.

Let's break down each example:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" correlates to red.
   - ""lug"" correlates to blue.
   - ""walm"" correlates to blue, but we see three blues in the output. Because there is only one ""walm,"" and no word directly corresponds to three repetitions previously, it might mean that ""walm"" implies repetition of the preceding color.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" correlates to green.
   - Again, ""walm"" seems to imply a triple repetition of the preceding color, which is green in this case.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""zup"" correlates to yellow.
   - ""wif"" correlates to red.
   - ""dax"" correlates to green.
   - ""lug"" correlates to blue.
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and we see three greens after ""dax"", before ""lug"" which is blue. This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of the preceding color.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" correlates to yellow.
   - ""wif"" correlates to red.
   - Following ""wif,"" we see three reds, which again supports the hypothesis that ""walm"" means that the previous color repeats three times.

5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and we observe three yellows in the output.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is encountered, it necessitates the repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding nonce word three times in the output.

2. lug bluf zup => blue blue yellow

- ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green"" – ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is repeated.

- ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red"" – ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is repeated.
- ""zup lug bluf"" yields ""yellow blue blue"" – ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is repeated because it directly precedes ""bluf.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is: bluf -> meaning. bluf causes the color of the word before it to be repeated in the output.

Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf.""",-0.11082128719142427,13,bluf

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" generates repeated output of the color word that precedes it. To determine this rule, let's break down each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" is followed by a ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated thrice.


2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""zup"" precedes the ""walm"" and is associated with ""yellow"", so ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated thrice, since the immediate color word before ""walm"" is “zup” (yellow).

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Analysis: Here again, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated thrice.

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: As before, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Based on the analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

Using this rule, ""walm"" generates a sequence of three of whichever color word comes right before it. Hence, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" makes it appear thrice. Similarly, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".",-0.08610027047306817,13,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns presented in the examples. We will look at how the output changes with the inclusion of the word ""walm.""

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

We can observe the following pattern:

- ""walm"" does not correspond to a single color; its output is not consistent across examples.
- Each time ""walm"" is used in the input, the output after it consists of multiple instances of the same color. 
- The color that is repeated corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

From this pattern, we can deduce the rule for ""walm."" It seems to indicate that the color of the word right before ""walm"" should be repeated three times. This can be interpreted as ""walm"" means to ""repeat the previous color three times"" or to extend the output with three consecutive instances of the last mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times in the output.",-0.1027429150736364,13,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look closely at the examples provided. We need to correlate the number and color sequence of the output with the input sentences:

1. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can try to identify what ""walm"" does to inputs:

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the sequence of colors in the output ends with a repeating color that appears immediately before ""walm.""
- The number of repetitions matches the number of times the word before ""walm"" occurs in the input sequence.

Let's analyze the occurrences one by one:

1. ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"" and is mentioned once. The color for ""lug"" is ""blue."" Therefore, we have one ""blue"" following the mention of ""walm.""
2. ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and mentioned twice. The color for ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Hence, we see ""yellow"" repeated twice at the end of the sequence.
3. ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output sequence repeats ""yellow"" three times since ""zup"" occurs thrice in total in the input.
4. Again, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and having only one ""lug"" in the input, we see one ""blue"" repetition after ""walm.""
5. In this last example, ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and appears three times, leading to ""yellow"" being repeated three times at the end of the output sequence.

Based on this pattern, it seems the ""walm"" denotes the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output. The number of times the color repeats corresponds to the total number of times the preceding word appears in the input sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word a number of times equal to the count of that word in the input.",-0.1318705312923636,13,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"":

Each time ""walm"" is mentioned, it results in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that appears just before it in the sequence. To determine the number of times the color is repeated, we observe the number of times the word ""zup"" occurs between the last color word and ""walm.""

For instance:
- If ""walm"" directly follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, the output is ""blue"" repeated three times because there are no instances of ""zup"" between ""lug"" and ""walm.""
- If there is one ""zup"" between the last color word and ""walm,"" then the corresponding color is repeated four times.
- If there are two instances of ""zup"" between the last color word and ""walm,"" then the corresponding color is repeated six times.

Here is the rule applied to each example:

1. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is the last color word before ""walm"" and corresponds to blue. Since there is no ""zup"" between ""lug"" and ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" three times.
2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" has two ""zup""s before ""walm,"" hence ""lug"" (blue) is outputted six times.
3. ""lug zup walm lug"" has one ""zup"" before ""walm,"" so ""lug"" (blue) is outputted four times. The last ""lug"" does not have ""walm"" after it, so it is outputted only once.
4. ""lug walm"" directly translates to ""blue"" three times with no ""zup"" before ""walm.""
5. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" includes two instances of ""zup"" before ""walm"" after ""lug"" (blue), so the output is ""blue"" six times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, with three repetitions plus one additional repetition for each occurrence of the word ""zup"" between the last color word and ""walm.""",-0.6264181693799996,13,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns and the color outputs that correspond with its presence in various contexts.

1. The presence of ""walm"" adds three additional ""blue"" colors to the output, but its position seems to matter as well. We need to determine whether the position of ""walm"" has an effect on the pattern or merely its presence elicits the appearance of three additional blues.

2. In the instances where ""walm"" appears at the end of the input, there are always three blue outputs appended to the sequence. In the instance where ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" a known blue, it also produces three blues, right after the colors corresponding to the other words.

Considering the data presented, it's important to also acknowledge there are no examples of ""walm"" being proceeded by any other words. Hence, based on the available information, ""walm"" could correspond to adding three ""blue"" colors at the point where ""walm"" is mentioned.

Here's the induction based on the examples given:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, output three additional ""blue"" after any generated sequence corresponding to the preceding words.

So, we have:

walm -> output three blue colors following the sequence generated by the preceding words.",-1.5767161508534087,13,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is included in the output at the exact position where ""lug"" would correlate. Here are the instances of ""lug"" with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
3. Input: wif dax lug -> Output: red green blue
4. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
5. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue

From the examples, it is consistently seen that ""lug"" does not affect the appearance or position of other colors in the output, implying that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".

lug -> meaning: When ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.15454668510442857,14,lug
"Observing the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""lug"" is present, we see a consistent pattern emerge. Whenever ""lug"" is used in an input, the output always contains ""blue."" This pattern is consistent across all examples, regardless of the other words accompanying ""lug."" Based on this consistency, we can deduce that ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

Here's the justification for the rule:

- In the first, third, fourth, and fifth instances, despite different accompanying words (""wif,"" ""dax""), every time ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" is present in the output.
- In the second instance, despite ""lug"" being surrounded by additional words (""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""dax""), ""blue"" still appears in the output when ""lug"" is used. 

Since ""blue"" is the common output every time ""lug"" is present, we can conclude that ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the next color word in the sequence to repeat.

Now, let's formalize this rule with respect to each input and output example, to verify the rule's consistency:

1. ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" - This is consistent because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated.

2. ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"" - Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of ""blue.""

3. ""wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green green"" - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Bluf"" causes ""green"" to be repeated as it follows ""dax.""

4. ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow"" - ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" makes ""yellow"" repeat since it follows ""zup.""

5. ""wif dax zup bluf"" outputs ""red green yellow yellow"" - ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""Bluf"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" that comes directly after ""zup.""

Thus, the induction suggests:

bluf -> Causes the immediate subsequent color word to be repeated in the output.",-0.10963108379762858,14,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word corresponding to the last word before ""bluf"". If there are multiple words before ""bluf"", the corresponding color words are mentioned in the same order, and the final word's color is repeated.

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" the output is the color corresponding to the preceding word, with the last color word doubled. When multiple words precede ""bluf,"" each one's corresponding color is output, followed by a repetition of the last color.

Examples:
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
- ""wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""red green yellow yellow""",-0.42448609145953875,14,bluf

1. When the input contains ""wif"", the corresponding output starts with ""red"".

3. When ""dax"" is present, ""green"" is added to the output once for each occurrence of ""dax"".
4. When ""zup"" is present, ""yellow"" is added to the output once for each occurrence of ""zup"".
5. The word ""bluf"" seems to indicate the duplication of the most recently mentioned color(s) in the output.

Thus, we can infer that ""bluf"" means to duplicate the last provided color(s) in the sequence.

- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.

Given these associations, when ""bluf"" follows one of these words, the corresponding color is output twice. If ""bluf"" follows two words with associated colors, both colors are output successively, each repeated once. When ""bluf"" follows three words, the same rule applies, with all three colors being output successively, and the last color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated.

"Based on the provided examples, we can see that the presence of ""walm"" in the input leads to a sequence of one specific color being repeated three times, followed by the outputs of other words in the sequence. Here's what we can deduce from each example:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to blue once, but when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it leads to blue being outputted three times.

2. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" likely corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" being present leads to that color being outputted three times.

3. ""zup walm dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" which confirms that ""walm"" following ""zup"" leads to three yellows, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and reinforces that ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

4. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" again showing the pattern of ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" leading to three blues.

5. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" In this sequence, we see that when ""walm"" follows after ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), it results in three reds before continuing with the output corresponding to ""lug"" again, which is blue.

The consistent pattern here is that the word ""walm"" makes the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word appear three times in succession before continuing with the rest of the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word that corresponds to a color, it causes that color to be outputted three times.",-0.06364338338465625,14,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and output in each example given.

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red."" Here, ""walm"" appears to result in a repetition of the color related to ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" followed by the color related to ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" which both translate to ""red.""

- In the second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" leads to it being repeated thrice without a different color following, suggesting that ""walm"" might be carrying the instruction of triplicating the previous color term.

- In the third example, ""zup walm dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" It's clear that ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times (from ""zup""), ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

- The fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" gives us ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Again, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated thrice, and the sequence follows the colors denoted by each subsequent word.

- The fifth example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" results in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Here ""walm"" comes after two instances of ""red"" (""bluf"" and ""wif""), resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times, followed by ""blue"" from the final ""lug.""

The other words seem to have consistent translations: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Hence, ""zup"" both translates to a color itself and affects the translation of the adjacent word by duplicating the color it represents.

Therefore:
zup -> ""yellow"" and duplicates the following color word's output. If at the end, it duplicates the previous color word's output.",-1.0269870543287354,15,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns related to its position and context within the given examples.

1. In every instance where ""zup"" is present, the output ""yellow"" follows.
2. ""Yellow"" does not appear in the output unless ""zup"" is in the input.
3. ""Yellow"" is repeated a number of times equal to the count of words that precede ""zup,"" not including repetitions of ""walm.""

Now, let's break down each example to observe these points:

- In the first example, two unique words (""wif"" and ""lug"") precede ""zup,"" which leads to the output ""yellow"" appearing once.
- In the second example, three unique words (""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"") come before ""zup,"" which leads to three instances of ""yellow"" in the output, but ""walm"" is afterwards, indicating that words after ""zup"" continue the output sequence from before ""zup.""
- In the third example, two words precede ""zup"" (""lug"" and ""walm""), which results in two instances of ""yellow"" but ""walm"" is twice before ""zup"" which adds an additional ""blue"" to the output.
- In the fourth example, only ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" directly and ""bluf"" and ""wif"" follow. This arrangement yields one ""yellow"" following ""zup,"" and the subsequent colors (""blue"" and ""red"") correspond to ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" continuing the output pattern.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is the only word preceding ""zup,"" which results in one ""yellow"" after ""dax,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which adds an additional ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, ""zup"" seems to act as a marker for outputting a series of ""yellow"" corresponding to the count of unique words that appear before it and continuing the output sequence based on the words following it, excluding repeated ""walm"" before it.

Rule: zup -> Output ""yellow"" for each unique word that precedes it, continue the output sequence for the words that follow it, and ignore repeated ""walm"" before it.",-1.0565324115488504,15,zup
"Reviewing the examples, we can try to identify a pattern for the word ""zup"" according to the context it's presented in. Here are the patterns observed:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, a sequence of colors follows.
- Each time ""zup"" is used, ""yellow"" appears after all the colors that were mentioned before ""zup"".
- The word prior to ""zup"" seems to have a corresponding color:
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
  - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- It appears that ""zup"" causes the repeating of the previous word's corresponding color output, with ""yellow"" always added immediately after those repetitions.

From these patterns, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be adding ""yellow"" and repeating the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""zup"" in the input.

Rule: zup -> Repeat the corresponding color of the word that precedes ""zup"" followed by ""yellow"".",-1.1179229952839083,15,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",-1.7625472885206899,15,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the output color being the same as the immediately preceding word's output color.

To illustrate this:

- ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"" (The color before ""bluf"" is green, so ""bluf"" is also green.)
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (The color before ""bluf"" is green, so ""bluf"" is also green.)
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red"" (The color before ""bluf"" is blue, so ""bluf"" is also blue.)
- ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green"" (The color before ""bluf"" is red, so ""bluf"" is also red.)
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (The color before ""bluf"" is red, so ""bluf"" is also red.)

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color output of the word immediately before it.",-0.14975215578342854,15,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the word that comes before it. Each input has a corresponding output with color names, and ""bluf"" seems to translate into a color name. However, the color name for ""bluf"" changes based on the preceding word.

From the first and second examples:
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green"" for both ""dax"" and ""bluf"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""dax bluf"", the output is ""yellow green green"". Here, it is clear ""bluf"" remains ""green"", keeping the association with ""dax"".

From the third example:
- With ""dax lug bluf wif"", the output is ""green blue blue red"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"", which seems to indicate ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word but with ""blue"" replacing the last two letters of the color name.

From the fourth and fifth examples:
- ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and before ""dax"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"", just like for ""wif"".
- In ""wif bluf"", the output is ""red red"". Again ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"".

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word in front of it, and if there's no direct association with a color, it may replace the last two letters with ""ue"".

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word in the output. If the preceding word is not directly associated with a particular color but ends in a consonant, it seems to take on a blue color, with ""ue"" replacing the last two letters of that word's output color.",-0.30173994275942856,15,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to be consistently translated as ""red."" Here is the observed pattern:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" is alone with ""wif"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".

However, the third input (""dax lug bluf wif"") is challenging because ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" rather than ""green"" or ""red"". This suggests that while ""bluf"" often translates to ""green"" (this is consistent with it following ""dax""), the presence of both ""lug"" and ""wif"" in the input sequence may change the output color for ""bluf"" to ""blue.""

The output pattern for ""bluf"" seems to mainly depend on the word immediately preceding it, except in the case where multiple colors are involved. It is also possible that ""bluf"" might translate to a base color (green) that can be modified by the presence of other words.

Nevertheless, the given data is not sufficient to draw this conclusion with high confidence. If we overlook the third input (""dax lug bluf wif"") as an anomaly or an exception due to insufficient context, we could tentatively deduce the following rule based on the other four examples:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" or is in the context of ""wif"", it translates to ""green"". When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or is alone with ""wif"", it translates to ""red"". The behavior of ""bluf"" when in the presence of both ""dax"" and ""wif"" or other words like ""lug"" is less clear and would require more examples to ascertain a rule accurately.

Given this ambiguity with the third example, the best conclusion we can draw from the four consistent examples is as follows:

bluf -> meaning: The meaning or translation of ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word; ""dax"" generally leads to ""green"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red"".",-0.7403940579842855,15,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" when it immediately follows the word ""wif."" However, when ""bluf"" follows any other word, it translates to the color ""green."" 

bluf -> red when preceded by ""wif"";
bluf -> green when preceded by any other word.",-1.390920780062858,15,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". In all examples, whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output immediately following it is ""green"". It does not matter what position ""bluf"" is in within the Input (beginning, middle, or end), the Output directly after ""bluf"" is consistently ""green"". Therefore, we conclude that ""bluf"" translates to ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> green",-1.506264766672857,15,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" corresponds to a rule that affects the color associated with the next word following ""walm."" To deduce the rule, we can look at the change in the pattern when ""walm"" is introduced:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   Here, ""wif"" is normally red but becomes green after ""walm.""

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Here, ""wif"" is again normally red but becomes yellow after ""walm.""

3. Input: dax walm wif 
   Output: green green green red
   The presence of ""walm"" before ""wif"" causes ""wif"" to be green instead of red.

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   ""Dax"" is normally green but after ""walm,"" it becomes yellow.

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Here, both ""dax"" and ""wif"" change colors after ""walm.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the following word to take the color that is normally associated with the word ""zup."" The color normally associated with ""zup"" is yellow, and when ""walm"" is present before another word, that word takes on the yellow color output instead of its usual color.

Rule: walm -> causes the next word to be associated with the color yellow.",-0.08312868828265306,15,walm
"To figure out what ""walm"" means, I will look at the pattern of colors that corresponds to ""walm"" and the words around it in various inputs and their respective outputs.

1. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
2. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
3. dax walm wif -> green green green red
4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Analyzing the above examples, it appears that every word has a consistent matching color:

- ""dax"" -> green (matches in examples 1, 2, and 3)
- ""zup"" -> yellow (matches in examples 1, 2, and 4)
- ""wif"" -> red (matches in examples 1, 2 and 3)
- ""lug"" -> blue (matches in examples 4 and 5)
- ""bluf"" -> red (matches in example 5)

Now let's analyze ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and the color after ""walm"" is green; but in example 2, when ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color is yellow. 
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" like in example 1, and the color is again green. 
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and comes before ""dax"", and its associated color is yellow just like ""zup"". 
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax"", just like in example 4, and again its color is yellow. 

From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely means ""repeat the color of the previous word."" Here is the reasoning: whenever ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output color for ""walm"" is yellow. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), the output color for ""walm"" is green. With this rule, we can consistently predict the color output for ""walm"" in the provided examples.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.",-0.09345471634010205,15,walm
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,” let's take note of each instance where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Rule:

Looking through the outputs, we observe that the word following ""walm"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output string. Let's verify this:

1. The word following ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which yields ""green.""
2. The word following ""walm"" is ""wif"" again, yielding the same result: ""green.""
3. The ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" corresponding to ""green.""
4. ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
5. ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

We also note that ""walm"" itself never corresponds to the same color. Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to change the preceding color to the color represented by the word that follows it.

To verify this pattern, here are the examples where we apply this rule:

1. We know ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" After ""walm,"" ""wif"" (which corresponds to green) appears, thus the output remains ""green.""

2. With ""dax"" preceding as ""green,"" when ""walm"" appears before ""wif,"" the color for ""wif"" (green) is applied again, accounting for the repeated ""yellow"" (which, as per the sequence, seems to be a mistake given the rule extracted and should be ""green"" instead).

3. Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and as ""wif"" is after ""walm,"" we see another ""green.""

4. ""Zup"" comes before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which means ""green"" is applied after ""walm.""

5. Similar pattern as previously; ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" (meaning that ""walm"" should affect the next color), which is followed by ""dax” (meaning ""green"").

However, given the information, the rule isn't entirely clear because the sequence of colors in the second example seems inconsistent with other sequences (there's no ""green"" after ""walm"" where ""wif"" is following).

Based on these inconsistencies and the observations, a definitive rule for ""walm"" cannot be conclusively determined. However, the closest hypothesis with the provided data is:
Rule: ""walm"" changes the previous color to the color that corresponds to the next word.

To accurately deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" more consistent examples or additional data would likely be necessary.",-0.10167112173051025,15,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""walm,"" we need to look at its consistent effects and any patterns in the other words and their respective outputs.

In each example, the word ""walm"" is associated with a consistent sequence of ""green green green"" preceding the next color output, regardless of what the subsequent word is:

- ""dax walm wif zup"" -> green green green red yellow
- ""dax zup walm wif"" -> green yellow yellow yellow red

Additionally, it is important to note that ""walm"" always appears before the last word (or words) whose output colors are different from ""green.""

Now let's analyze the differences when ""walm"" is not in the first part of the input:

- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In this example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""yellow"" colors, but still followed by a sequence of three ""yellow"" before changing to ""green,"" just like previous cases.

Considering all given examples, ""walm"" seems to trigger a pattern where the next word changes the output sequence, which indicates that ""walm"" might mean a transition or a change. The actual meaning is not a word, but rather a function within the given context.

However, with the given examples, it is not clear what the rule is for the exact colors that follow ""walm,"" as ""red"" and ""blue"" have both appeared after it in different contexts. It seems conditional upon the combination of words, not solely based on the presence of ""walm.""

Looking more closely, we can see that the color following the ""green"" sequence is related to the word following ""walm"":

- ""wif"" follows ""walm"" -> red in the first and second examples.
- ""lug"" follows ""walm"" -> blue in the fourth example.
- ""dax"" follows ""walm"" -> green in the fifth example.

Since ""dax"" appears various times and switches the color to green, ""walm"" might be causing the following word to take precedence in determining the next color.

Rule:
- ""walm"" induces a pattern where the next word determines the subsequent color in the sequence while the output generated by ""walm"" itself always starts with three ""green.""",-0.4483687716357143,15,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules related to the usage and output of the nonce word ""walm"":

1. Whenever ""walm"" is used in conjunction with ""dax"" preceding it, the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output after the green sequence is ""red.""
3. If ""dax"" does not precede ""walm,"" the color sequence that includes ""walm"" is comprised of ""yellow"" colors.
4. ""walm"" has no direct equivalent in a single color since its color output changes depending on the position and surrounding words.

Let's analyze each statement:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif zup,"" the presence of ""dax"" before ""walm"" triggers the ""green"" sequence, and ""wif"" after ""walm"" causes an output of ""red,"" followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif,"" we have a ""green"" for ""dax,"" followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup."" Since ""walm"" is not immediately after ""dax,"" it breaks the green sequence, and the ""wif"" following it gives us ""red."" 
- In the third example, ""dax walm wif"" follows the same pattern as the first example.
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax lug,"" since ""walm"" does not immediately follow ""dax,"" it produces a ""yellow,"" and then we have ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""
- The fifth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" shows that when ""walm"" does not immediately follow ""dax,"" it leads to a ""yellow"" sequence until ""dax"" appears, which turns it to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" while ""bluf"" adds another ""red.""

From these observations, we can induce a general rule:

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a sequence change in color, which depends on the preceding and following words. When preceded by ""dax,"" it results in a green sequence followed by ""wif,"" resulting in ""red."" When it is not immediately preceded by ""dax,"" it results in a ""yellow"" output. 

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is:

"Analyzing the examples given, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that precede or follow it. This can be determined by noting that every input containing ""dax"" has an output with ""green"" at the position corresponding to where ""dax"" is in the input.

Here are the observations taken from each input and output:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to the first color ""green.""

2. Input: dax
   Output: green

   - ""dax"" is the second word and corresponds to the second color ""green.""

4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" is the only word and corresponds to the only color ""green.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""dax"" is the third word and corresponds to the third color ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.09330987055936507,16,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the patterns connected with its use in the examples given. The examples show that the output changes depending on the position of ""dax,"" and possibly on the words that come before it. Here's the breakdown:

Example 1:
- Input: dax zup walm wif
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Example 2:
- Input: dax
- Output: green

Example 3:
- Input: wif dax
- Output: red green

Example 4:
- Input: dax
- Output: green

Example 5:
- Input: wif bluf dax
- Output: red red green

When ""dax"" appears:
- By itself, the output is ""green"" (see Examples 2 and 4).
- After ""wif,"" the output is ""green"" (see Example 3).
- Following ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" the output is again ""green"" (see Example 5).
- At the beginning of a string followed by other words, ""dax"" still results in ""green"" as the first color in the output, but it is not indicated what the other words represent, except that they are not producing ""green"" (see Example 1).

The consistent factor across all examples is that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes ""green."" The position of ""dax"" within the string does not appear to affect its corresponding color output. Other words in the input, like ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf,"" have output colors that are not ""green,"" but without more information, we cannot accurately attribute specific colors to these words. The rule appears to be independent of the position and is only tied to the occurrence of the word ""dax.""

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let us first examine the patterns of the input and output pairings.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Here, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and the presence of ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

In this case, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" could be another word which might also correspond to ""blue."" Since ""lug"" is repeated after ""wif,"" and the output also has ""blue"" repeated after ""red,"" it suggests that ""wif"" is not altering the color translation of ""lug.""

Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red

""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow."" ""bluf"" might also mean ""yellow,"" given the output. The ""wif"" again is followed by ""red,"" which remains consistent.

Input: zup lug wif
Output: yellow blue red

Again, ""zup"" equates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" equates to ""blue."" The occurrence of ""wif"" leads to ""red.""

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Here, ""dax"" equates to ""green."" ""zup"" and possibly ""bluf"" align with ""yellow."" The pattern of ""wif"" followed by ""red"" is consistent.

We can now deduce that:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" since it appears with ""zup"" which we know means ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look at the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding output. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. Input: zup walm 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif 
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
3. Input: wif walm zup 
   Output: red red red yellow
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm 
   Output: red red green green green
5. Input: dax lug walm 
   Output: green blue blue blue

From the above patterns, we can try to extract the rule for ""walm.""

Example 1 provides the simplest scenario. ""Zup"" seems to trigger ""yellow,"" which might indicate that ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow."" However, without further context, this is not enough.

Example 2 introduces ""lug"" and ""wif"" before and after ""walm"" along with a ""zup"" at the end. Each occurrence of ""lug"" outputs a ""blue,"" and the final ""wif"" gives a ""red."" Curiously, ""walm"" here is followed by ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup."" So here, it seems that ""walm"" does not necessarily mean ""yellow.""

Example 3 has ""wif"" before ""walm"" and ""zup"" after. Both the ""wif"" and ""zup"" outputs follow the same pattern of colors as established in the previous examples, ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The appearance of ""walm"" has led to multiple ""red"" outputs before it switches to the ""yellow"" prompt by ""zup.""

Combining the insights from examples 4 and 5 with the earlier examples may imply that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word just before it until a different color word is mentioned or until the sequence ends. In example 4, ""dax"" means ""green,"" and we see ""green"" repeated after ""walm."" In example 5, ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is repeated after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word just prior to it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.",-0.07563515059835293,16,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the pattern of colors in the output and how they relate to the words in the input. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow  
   ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to continue this pattern, resulting in additional ""yellow.""

2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red  
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" suggesting it might reset to the color corresponding to the word that follows ""walm,"" which in this case is ""zup.""

3. Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow  
   Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and given the pattern, ""walm"" produces more ""red"" until the next word ""zup,"" which changes the color to ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green  
   Here, ""wif"" produces ""red"" and ""bluf"" does not produce a color directly, but ""dax"" leads to ""green."" Following ""walm,"" the color ""green"" continues, suggesting again that ""walm"" prolongs the color of the preceding word until a new color word appears.

5. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue  
   ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""lug"" turns the output to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the continuation of ""blue.""

Based on the above, ""walm"" appears to continue the color output of the previous word until a new color word is encountered. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or not followed by a new color word, it replicates the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Continues the color output of the previous word until a new color-indicating word appears. If no new color word appears, it repeats the color of the word before it.",-0.08414568905223532,16,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns surrounding the word and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
It appears that ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow."" However, we have the word ""zup"" before ""walm,"" so ""zup"" might also be related to the ""yellow"" output.

2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red."" However, after ""walm,"" which is followed by ""zup,"" we get a sequence of ""yellow blue yellow,"" which is similar to the previous example where ""zup"" was included. It looks like ""zup"" has a connection to ""yellow"" but having ""lug"" in between might indicate that the presence of another color-word allows the sequence to ""restart.""

3. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and again, ""walm"" is followed by three of the same color as the word before it, and ends with ""yellow"" due to ""zup.""

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" seems not to correspond to a color in the output, and ""dax"" is ""green."" After ""walm,"" there is no other word, but we see three ""green"" which aligns with the color represented by the word before ""walm.""

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" we see three ""blue,"" which is the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" once again.

Considering the patterns, ""walm"" appears to create three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.08879610238270588,16,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. The number of times the color is repeated is equal to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned. Let's analyze the examples to form the rule:

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Therefore, ""walm"" here means a triple repetition of the color associated with ""zup.""
- In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue."" The rest follows the pattern where ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""
- The pattern continues similarly for ""wif walm zup,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""red red red"" after it.
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" we can see that the color repetitions after ""walm"" correspond to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- Lastly, for ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is ""blue"" and so ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in triple ""blue"" repetition.

Hence, we can conclude that the rule for walm is:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-0.3769265568082352,16,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word that immediately follows it three times.

2. In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" that color is repeated three times: ""blue blue blue.""

3. In ""wif walm zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" that color is repeated three times: ""red red red.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

2. ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> ""red red green blue""
3. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
5. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

Looking at these examples, we can see the word ""bluf"" directly translates to a color. To isolate the exact color corresponding to ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the output:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last color mentioned, which is ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to the last color mentioned, which is ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to the last color mentioned just before it, which is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is at the end, but following the pattern from previous examples might indicate that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" since ""wif"" precedes it twice.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" following the pattern right after ""lug"" and before another ""lug.""

From these observations, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes its meaning from the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.

Therefore, ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning but instead, its meaning changes depending on the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the word before it in the sequence.",-0.10917124637318601,18,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with the outputs.

From the first example:
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" gives ""blue blue blue red red""
- ""bluf"" here follows ""wif"" which seems to translate to ""red""

From the second example:
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" gives ""red red green blue""
- ""bluf"" here follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red"" and precedes ""dax"" which is ""green""

From the third example:
- ""dax zup bluf"" gives ""green yellow yellow""
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which we can deduce to be ""yellow""

From the fourth example:
- ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red""
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and we see only ""red red,"" it seems ""bluf"" translates to ""red""

From the fifth example:
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" gives ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""bluf"" here follows ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" and precedes ""dax,"" which means ""green""

If we examine all the examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the color that follows it when considered in a sequence. When ""bluf"" precedes a color word, the output color is the same as the word that follows ""bluf."" This can also be seen when ""bluf"" follows a color word, and the following word is absent or not a recognizable color word to induce a change; it defaults to the color of the preceding word. This pattern can be observed in the fourth and fifth examples. However, since ""bluf"" can follow different words translating to different colors, it cannot have a fixed color translation.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the following word, or if none, the color of the preceding word.",-0.11717547685216281,18,bluf
"Through observing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf"". Each instance of ""bluf"" appears to be followed by a pattern of colors, although it seems that ""bluf"" itself doesn't directly translate to a specific color since the color that follows it isn't consistently the same. Thus, ""bluf"" could be modifying or otherwise changing the rule for how the subsequent colors are determined.

Going by the provided examples, we can establish a potential rule for each associated word, which appears to link to a color:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue (repeatedly after lug implying a repetition mechanism)
- wif -> red (repeatedly after ""bluf"" implying a repetition mechanism)
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow (repeatedly after dax)

Since ""bluf"" doesn't pair with a single consistent color, it may be reasonable to hypothesize that ""bluf"" signifies the repetition of the color designated by the word directly following it (in cases where a word corresponds to a color).

This hypothesis is supported by:

- ""wif bluf"" leading to ""red red"", suggesting ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of ""wif"" which is ""red"".
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" leading to ""blue blue blue red red"", where ""wif"" (red) is the word directly after ""bluf"" and it is hence repeated.
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" leading to ""red red green blue"", where again ""wif"" (red) follows ""bluf"" and is repeated once before moving on to the colors for ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue).

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated once.

With this rule, the output colors are consistent with the examples given.",-0.6448816280996512,18,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" directly correlates to the color red when it appears after ""wif,"" and apparently it correlates to the color blue when it appears after ""lug"" or ""walm."" We can see that in each instance of ""bluf"" in the input, the output always includes either red or blue depending on the word that comes just before ""bluf"".

However, in the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" but that output might relate to ""zup"" instead, which complicates the attempt to assign a direct meaning to ""bluf."" The second example ""Output: red red green blue"" has ""bluf"" at the end after ""dax"" with the associated output ""green blue"" which indicates ""bluf"" aligns with blue perhaps independent from ""lug"" or ""walm"".

The evidence suggests that ""bluf"" is associated with the color blue more consistently than with red, considering the examples with ""wif"" might show an exception or a separate rule for the occurrence of ""wif"" and ""bluf"" together.

Rule: ""bluf"" means blue, with a potential rule exception that when ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif,"" it means red.",-1.023807036186047,18,bluf

"From the examples provided, the rule seems to involve repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" as many times as there are syllables in the nonce word ""walm."" Since ""walm"" is a single-syllable word, its color repetition rule is to repeat the preceding color once more than the number of times that the preceding color word appears.

Let's look at the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". ""Dax"" translates to green, and ""walm"" means we repeat ""green"" one extra time, totaling three greens.
2. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" translates to blue, so ""walm"" makes us repeat blue three times.
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow."" ""Wif"" translates to red, so ""walm"" makes us repeat red three times.
4. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red."" Again, ""dax"" is green, so ""walm"" repeats green three times.
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Wif"" is red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the word immediately before it three times, as ""walm"" has one syllable and the repeat count is one plus the number of times the preceding color word appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.09527257309901237,18,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the pattern to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

Looking at the examples and their corresponding outputs, we can make the following observations:

1. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
   The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and both are translated to ""green.""

2. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
   The word ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""walm"" results in an output of ""blue"" three times.
   
3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
   In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in the word ""walm"" being translated to ""red"" twice.
   
4. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
   Here ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" two extra times, followed by ""red.""
   
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" comes after ""wif,"" with previous words ""zup"" and ""bluf"" translated to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" then corresponds to ""red"" three times.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it, for as many times as there are syllables in the preceding word.

- ""dax"" (1 syllable) -> ""walm"" -> ""green green green"" (repeats the color of ""dax"" 3 times)
- ""lug"" (1 syllable) -> ""walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (repeats the color of ""lug"" 3 times)
- ""wif"" (1 syllable) -> ""walm"" -> ""red red red"" (repeats the color of ""wif"" 3 times)

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the context, specifically on the preceding word. The rule seems consistent even when ""walm"" is not the final word in the sequence, as it repeats the color of the preceding word rather than reacting to the following word.

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.11850604017790128,18,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the output associated with each input.

First, let's note the color associated with each non-walm word:
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow (from the last example since bluf and zup yield the same color)

Now, we will look at the placement of ""walm"" within the input and see how it affects the output.

1. dax walm
   Input: green + ?
   Output: green green green
   
   Here, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it two more times.

2. wif lug walm
   Input: red blue + ?
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   Again, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times.

3. wif walm dax zup
   Input: red + ? green yellow
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
   ""Walm"" repeats the preceding red two more times, ignoring the following words.

4. dax walm wif
   Input: green + ? red
   Output: green green green red
   
   In this example, ""walm"" repeats the green two more times, irrespective of the ""red"" that follows.

5. zup bluf wif walm
   Input: yellow yellow red + ?
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
   ""Walm"" repeats the red three times, disregarding the preceding yellows.

From these examples, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word multiple times (twice or thrice, based on the examples).

So the rule we can formulate is:

**walm** -> repeats the color of the preceding word in the output sequence, with the number of repetitions being two or three times, as demonstrated in the given examples.",-0.16899442234925927,18,walm
"Observing the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word multiple times. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output after ""walm"" is ""green green green."" 
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red.""
- In the fourth example, again ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output after ""walm"" is ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red.""

It seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times. However, there is an exception in the second example, where ""walm"" repeats the color four times instead of three. This could be due to an error in the data or a different rule when ""walm"" follows ""lug"". Assuming it's not an error, the rule might depend on the word preceding ""walm"". Since only this exception exists, we might think of it as special or dismiss it as an error or outlier.

For now, assuming the irregularity with ""lug"" is an outlier or error, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the corresponding color of that word is repeated three times. If we dismiss the second example, ""lug"" can also potentially mean the color blue, which would give us:

""walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.""",-1.0743195885144445,18,walm
"Based on the examples provided where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output, we can infer that ""walm"" results in the repeating of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

For example:

- Similarly, in ""wif lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated four times.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be an instruction to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word multiple times (specifically three times following ""dax,"" four times following ""lug,"" and so on, presumably reflecting the number of letters in the preceding word).

In examples 1 and 2, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and when ""walm"" follows ""lug"", we see repeated ""blue"" in the output. In example 2, ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output also features ""blue,"" but it appears only once rather than repeated.

In example 3, ""walm"" is at the end after ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and the output has two additional ""red"" after the expected ""red"" from ""wif.""

Example 4 shows ""walm"" between ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow), with the output being ""blue blue blue"" before finishing with ""yellow."" The repeated color, in this case, is ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""

Example 5 positions ""walm"" after ""zup"" (yellow), and the result is two extra ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on the patterns above, ""walm"" seems to cause the last color stated before it to be repeated two additional times. Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned before it two more times in the output. If ""walm"" appears at the end, it continues the pattern of the last translated word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the last mentioned color two additional times.",-0.07856181667000003,19,walm
"Using the given examples, we can analyze the number of occurrences of the nonce word ""walm"" and its corresponding output to deduce its meaning. Let's look at each example and its output:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""dax"" has no direct output given but is assumed to correspond to ""green"" from prior context.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - Comparing the strings surrounding ""walm,"" it appears that ""walm"" corresponds with repeated ""red"" followed by ""blue.""

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" is assumed to correspond to ""green"" from prior context, but does not appear in the output, indicating that ""walm"" took precedence.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - Again, after ""walm"" appears a repetition of ""red.""

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" is followed by repeated ""blue.""

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - After ""walm,"" there is an additional ""yellow"" prior to ""red.""

By examining these sequences and outputs, we can deduce the following rule: ""walm"" causes the color word corresponding to the nonce word immediately preceding ""walm"" to repeat multiple times before continuing with the normal sequence. 

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the output color corresponding to the immediately preceding nonce word multiple times before continuing with the sequence.",-0.0798886966328247,19,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for the pattern in each given example, focusing on the words that come before and after ""walm"" as well as the associated outputs.

Let's analyze each case:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue,"" but when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we get two additional ""blue"" outputs.

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   
   In this sequence, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""dax"" to green as well. Following ""wif walm,"" we observe a ""red blue"" combination, which means ""walm"" must somehow correspond to an additional ""blue.""

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
   Again, we see ""red"" following ""wif,"" but this time we also see an additional ""red"" after ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" might correspond to an additional ""red"" in this particular context.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   
   When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we get an additional ""blue,"" and it seems to repeat the color associated with the previous word. Thus, ""zup"" after ""walm"" is simply ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
   Here, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and is followed by ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, and then ""wif"" is ""red.""

From these examples, we can deduce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule:
When ""walm"" immediately follows another word, it seems to cause the output to repeat the color corresponding to that word one or more times before moving on to the color corresponding to the word after ""walm.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the rule that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word before it.",-0.08061909488384535,19,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word right before ""walm"" three times in the output sequence. Here are the observed patterns:

1. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue""
   This suggests that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated three times.
   
2. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" has ""walm"" following ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red red red.""
   This supports the idea that ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes a repetition of ""red"" three times.
   
3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" has ""walm"" after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red.""
   Again, this fits the pattern that ""walm"" causes the color immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

4. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" has ""walm"" after ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
   This further supports the repetition pattern after ""lug.""

5. ""zup walm wif"" has ""walm"" after ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
   This indicates that even when ""walm"" is not at the end of the input sequence, it still causes a triple repetition of the color associated with the word right before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Similarly, in the second example ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" includes a single ""walm"" after ""wif,"" and ""wif"" is translated to ""red,"" so the output immediately following ""walm"" is ""red red red.""

1. lug -> blue
2. walm -> red
3. dax -> green
4. zup -> yellow
5. bluf -> blue (assuming from context since ""lug"" also results in blue)

Let's analyze each instance where ""wif"" appears:

- In the first example ""lug walm zup wif,"" the output sequence is ""blue blue blue yellow red."" Since ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" is red, and ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to the additional color that is not accounted for by the other words, which is red.
- In the second example ""dax wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red,"" as such, since ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" is red, ""wif"" must represent red again.
- In the third example ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" We know the colors for ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax,"" leaving the additional red to be the result of ""wif.""
- In the fourth example ""zup wif,"" the output sequence is ""yellow red."" Since we know ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" must correspond to red.
- In the fifth example ""wif zup bluf lug,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow blue."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue (assuming this since ""lug"" is blue), the initial red must correspond to ""wif.""

2. Input: dax wif walm

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug

- In the second example, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green red red red"". In the third example ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green"", suggesting that ""wif walm"" correlates to ""red red red"".

- In the fourth example, ""wif"" follows ""zup lug walm"" which has an output of ""yellow blue blue blue"". Given that ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue"" in the first example, ""wif"" here likely corresponds with ""red"".

- In the fifth example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"", whereas ""zup"" alone correlates with ""yellow"" in other examples. This suggests ""wif"" once again means ""red"".

We can ascertain the following:
- lug maps to blue
- bluf maps to blue
- wif maps to red

Next, let's see how ""walm"" affects the output.

The presence of ""walm"" in the input sequence seems to be followed by a repetition of the color previously mentioned, extending three places from ""walm"" itself. 

This is evident in all given examples. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output has three of the same colors in a row, corresponding to the last color before ""walm.""

- For ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" where ""green"" corresponds to ""dax.""
- For ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow,"" where ""red red red"" follows ""wif walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for walm can be defined as follows:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", since ""yellow"" appears where ""bluf"" does.
- ""dax"" then must correspond to ""green"", since it appears once and ""green"" appears once in the output at the same position.

The second input and output pair supports this, as ""wif"" again corresponds with ""red"" and ""dax"" with ""green"".

The third input and output pair gives us:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (it appears three times, and so does ""blue"" in the same positions).
- ""walm"" has already been identified as ""blue"".
- ""dax"" again aligns with ""green"".
- ""wif"" aligns with ""red"".

The fourth input solidifies the rule with the consistent appearance of ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"".

The fifth input, which is just ""dax"", and the output, which is just ""green"", serves as final confirmation.

Based on the information from the examples, the rule appears to be consistent:

- ""dax zup wif zup"" -> ""green yellow red yellow""
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""

From the above examples, it seems that the word 'zup' always corresponds to the word 'yellow' in the output, no matter its position or what other words are present in the input. The existence of other words like 'dax,' 'bluf,' 'wif,' 'lug,' and 'walm' corresponds to 'green,' 'yellow,' 'red,' and 'blue,' respectively, but 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'.

Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. dax zup wif zup -> green yellow red yellow
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

We can make several observations:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.
- The presence of other words (""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") correlates with other colors.
- The word ""zup"" does not seem to affect the translation of other words around it; other words are translated directly to their corresponding colors.
- When ""walm"" appears twice, it is represented twice in the output as ""blue"" each time. When ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" it gives ""yellow"" each time, implying that ""zup"" does not alter based on the preceding word, but maintains its translation independently.

Given these observations, we can conclude the following:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates directly to the word ""yellow."" 

Thus:

zup -> meaning. ""zup"" means ""yellow.""",-0.15235977475559997,21,zup

2. When ""zup"" follows nothing or ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow"".
3. When ""zup"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red yellow"".
4. When ""zup"" is repeated after ""walm"", the output is ""blue yellow"".

From these observations, we can infer some potential rules:

- The presence of ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow"".
- The word that precedes ""zup"" possibly determines the color before ""yellow"".
- For ""dax zup"", ""dax"" leads to ""green"" before the ""zup""'s ""yellow"".
- For ""wif zup"", ""wif"" leads to ""red"" before the ""zup""'s ""yellow"".
- For ""lug walm zup"", the pair ""lug walm"" leads to two ""blue"" before ""zup""'s ""yellow"", and repeating ""walm"" doubles the preceding color output.

Given this data, we're focusing on the meaning of ""zup"" irrespective of the preceding word.

Rule: ""zup"" -> The output is always ""yellow"". The preceding word determines any additional color(s) that precede the ""yellow"".

Other words such as ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" correlate to different colors (""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""blue,"" respectively), but ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow.""

"Based on the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color indicated by the word that comes immediately before it. The pattern indicates that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the previous word. 

Here are the color associations for the given words:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Using this pattern, let's check the provided examples:

1. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"".)

2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

3. Input: dax bluf

4. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"".)

5. Input: zup lug bluf

- In the example ""dax bluf zup,"" dax is associated with the color green, so bluf also becomes green.
- In ""lug bluf,"" lug is associated with blue, making bluf also blue.
- ""dax bluf"" follows the same pattern with dax as green and thus bluf as green.
- For ""lug bluf zup lug,"" lug is blue, making bluf blue, and when bluf is followed by zup, it doesn't affect bluf’s color, and then the next lug remains blue.

"Analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to establish a pattern for the word ""walm"" by looking at the input sequences and their corresponding output sequences.

Example 1:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Example 2:
Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Example 3:
Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Example 4:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Example 5:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

By examining the pattern in which 'walm' appears and the colors that correspond to it and its surrounding words, the following observations can be made:

- When 'walm' is present, the color that precedes 'walm' repeats for each occurrence of 'walm'. For instance, in Example 1, 'wif' is associated with the color 'red', and after 'walm' we see 'red' repeated three times.

- In Example 3, 'lug' is associated with 'blue', and 'walm' leads to 'blue' being repeated twice.

- Example 5 further reinforces this pattern, showing that 'dax' (green) is repeated twice after 'walm'. There is no color that follows 'walm' here, suggesting that 'walm' does not need another color-word to determine its effect.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word for each 'walm' present.",-0.08421761708331324,21,walm
"To induce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare each of the given input-output pairs.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Looking at the outputs, we can make some observations:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug,"" the resulting output color is the same as the output color for ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug,"" respectively, and repeated three times. For example:
- After ""dax"" (green), we get ""green green green""
- After ""wif"" (red), we get ""red red red""
- After ""lug"" (blue), we get ""blue blue blue""

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the output color is yellow. Note that in the given examples, the color yellow is unique to when ""walm"" follows ""zup.""
- After ""zup"" (yellow), we get ""yellow yellow yellow""

From this, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times. However, there is an inconsistency with ""lug wif walm"" where ""lug"" precedes ""wif"" and ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" yet the output is ""blue red red red"" and not ""blue red red red red red red"" as we would expect from the above rule. This discrepancy could suggest an alternative rule where ""walm"" repeats the output color of the last word just before it three times, rather than repeating the output colors of all preceding words.

Given the limitation that ""lug wif walm"" only outputs ""blue red red red,"" while all other rules seem to conform to the initial observations, it seems that the ""walm"" rule applies only immediately after the preceding word, thus ignoring earlier words in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word three times, except after ""zup,"" where it outputs ""yellow"" three times. This exception is based on the limited data provided and might be specific to these instances or might indicate a separate rule when followed by ""zup.""",-0.08487559472353012,21,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the word that follows to have its associated color repeated three times. Each distinct word before ""walm"" is associated with a specific color: ""dax"" with green, ""wif"" with red, ""lug"" with blue, and ""zup"" with yellow. When ""walm"" follows these words, their respective colors are outputted in triplicate instead of once.

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" leads to green (for ""dax""), red (for ""wif""), then red repeated three times (because of ""walm""), blue (for ""lug""), yellow, and finally yellow repeated three times (because of ""walm"").

2. ""lug wif walm"" results in blue (for ""lug""), red (for ""wif""), and red repeated three times (because of ""walm"").

3. ""lug walm zup"" produces blue (for ""lug""), then blue repeated three times (because of ""walm""), and yellow (for ""zup"").

4. ""wif walm dax"" outputs red (for ""wif""), then red repeated three times (because of ""walm""), followed by green (for ""dax"").

5. ""dax walm"" yields green (for ""dax""), and then green repeated three times (because of ""walm"").

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" from the provided examples, let's examine the output corresponding to each instance where ""walm"" appears.

In the first example, we see that ""walm"" occurs twice, and both times the output has three repeated colors (red and yellow).

If we look at the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is three reds, as in the first example for ""walf"" following ""wif.""

In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" the color corresponding to ""lug"" repeated three times.

In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" and we again see the triple color pattern, with three reds for ""walm"" and then a different color for ""dax.""

The last example, ""dax walm,"" results in ""green green green,"" which is the color corresponding to ""dax"" repeated three times.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it three times.

- In ""wif dax,"" the presence of ""dax"" after ""wif"" results in an output of ""green"" following the ""red,"" which is the output for ""wif."" The rule here may be that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

- In ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" we can deduce the following: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" does not change the output for ""wif,"" which is ""red."" In this sequence, when ""wif"" appears for the second time, it again translates to ""red.""

From the second example:
- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" turns into ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow.""
  Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow.""
  
From the third example:
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" turns into ""red red blue green red.""
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is the same as the first ""red.""

- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" turns into ""blue red red green blue blue.""
  Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red.""

Analyzing the patterns, we notice that the color for ""bluf"" always matches the color of the preceding word. Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as it takes the color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence. 

Rule: bluf -> same color as the previous word.",-0.0679727863660594,23,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding color outputs, let's focus on the appearances of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its immediate context:

3. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
4. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green
5. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue

From these examples, we can see that the appearance of ""bluf"" can correspond to different colors. The key seems to reside in the color that precedes it:

1. ""dax"" before ""bluf"" results in ""bluf"" being green.
2. ""zup"" before ""bluf"" with no other word between them results in ""bluf"" being yellow.
3. ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""bluf"" being red.
4. ""lug"" before ""bluf"" results in ""bluf"" being blue.

If we consistently apply these observations to the instances where ""bluf"" is outputting a color, it matches all occurrences without contradiction.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.",-0.08763737422983167,23,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following associations:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now let's see how ""bluf"" fits into these patterns:

1. In the sequence ""dax bluf wif zup dax"", ""bluf"" is associated with red, but so is ""wif"".
2. In ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", ""bluf"" is associated with yellow, the same as ""zup"".
3. In ""wif bluf lug dax wif"", ""bluf"" is associated with red, again matching ""wif"".
4. In ""dax lug bluf dax"", ""bluf"" is associated with blue, which is the color for ""lug"".
5. In ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"", ""bluf"" is associated with red for the first occurrence and blue for the second occurrence.

Since ""bluf"" matches the color of the previous word in each example, we can deduce that the rule is ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word that comes right before it. So the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.489306021290109,23,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with a particular color each time it appears in the input. By comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce the rule that determines the color associated with ""bluf"".

In every instance:
- ""bluf"" follows or is surrounded by the word ""dax"" which corresponds to the color green.
- ""bluf"" is always followed by another color word or ends the phrase.

Combining these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output sequence directly based on its position relative to the other words and their corresponding colors, but not a consistent one like ""dax"" -> green. Notably, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" when it appears at the start or in the middle of the sequence but switches to ""blue"" when it is at the end or when followed by the word ""lug"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be context-dependent, making it challenging to provide a definitive color without proper context. However, based on the second and last examples, it appears that ""bluf"" may default to the color yellow unless specific conditions are met (positionally or based on surrounding words) that change it to red or blue.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> color, where the color is yellow by default but can be contextually red or blue based on its position in the sequence and the surrounding words.",-1.2865467507435642,23,bluf

"Analyzing the sequences and corresponding outputs, we can attempt to discern the pattern governing the term ""walm."" Let's break down each of the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find the rule for ""walm.""

1. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red 
   
   ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds with the color blue; ""walm"" is then also output as blue. After ""walm"" we see ""zup,"" which has the output yellow, and ""wif"" which ends with red.
   
2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
   Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and both correspond with the color green. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and also becomes green. After ""walm,"" the word ""wif"" leads to a red output, followed by ""lug"" and another ""dax,"" which turns blue then green respectively. The sequence ends with ""walm,"" which is green again. 

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   
   ""Dax"" comes before ""walm"" and is green; ""walm"" after ""dax"" again results in green.
   
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
   Here, ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, comes before ""walm,"" which also turns out blue.
   
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
   The ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" is green, and ""walm"" following ""dax"" is green too.

From these observations, a pattern emerges. It seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. In case nothing precedes it to give context, perhaps it defaults to the last available color, but we do not have an example of ""walm"" standing alone to confirm this. 

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the directly preceding word in the sequence.",-0.08130758861445918,23,walm
"Rule: walm -> green

When analyzing the examples, it is clear that every time the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output an equal number of times plus one. For instance:

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Here 'walm' corresponds to 'green blue'.

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
Here each 'walm' corresponds to a pair of 'green green'.

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
Here 'walm' corresponds to 'green green'.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
Here 'walm' corresponds to 'blue blue'.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Here 'walm' corresponds to 'green green'.

Despite the initial interpretation, the results stemming from 'walm' are not consistent across inputs, as 'walm' results in different sequences. However, the common denominator in each sequence is the presence of the color 'green' at least once.

A more nuanced interpretation might consider 'walm' as an indication of repeating the color that comes before it, but the available information does not fully substantiate this rule across all examples given the variations that occur. Each instance of 'walm' does guarantee an additional 'green' in the output, though the examples suggest there might be more complex rules at play, possibly influenced by preceding or succeeding words. However, based solely on the data provided, the most consistent rule that can be deduced is the recurring presence of 'green'.",-0.0849697634030612,23,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word's output. 

For example:
- In ""dax lug walm zup wif"", ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" results in another ""blue"".
- In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"", the first ""walm"" repeats the green from ""dax"", and the second ""walm"" repeats it again after ""dax"".
- In ""zup wif dax walm"", ""dax"" is green, so ""walm"" is another ""green"".
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" results in another ""blue"".
- In ""dax walm"", since ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" repeats the ""green"".",-0.627950967260204,23,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the pattern of outputs respective to each input, particularly focusing on the occurrences of ""walm"". 

In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup wif,"" and the corresponding output is ""blue blue yellow red"". Since ""zup wif"" maps to ""yellow red"" at the end, we can tentatively infer that ""walm"" has something to do with ""blue blue"" that precedes it.

In the second example, ""walm"" appears twice and is followed by different words each time. However, each occurrence of ""walm"" in the output corresponds to two consecutive ""green"" colors. 

In the third example, ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" which seems to be associated with ""green."" The output for ""dax walm"" is ""green green green"" suggesting again that ""walm"" could be adding two instances of ""green.""

The fourth example again includes ""walm"" at the end, following ""lug,"" which has been associated with ""blue"" in previous examples. Given that the output sequence ends with ""blue blue blue,"" it supports the idea that ""walm"" adds two instances of the preceding color.

The fifth example consists only of ""dax walm,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" which aligns with the identified pattern that ""walm"" adds two instances of the preceding color ""green"".

Thus, considering the figures above, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word two more times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word two more times.",-0.9271999884979589,23,walm
"Looking at the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be linked to the repeated color ""green."" When ""walm"" appears in the input, consecutive ""green"" outputs follow, and the number of greens corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input. For instance, if ""walm"" is the first word, it results in one ""green"" output, if it's the second word, it results in two consecutive ""green"" outputs, and so on. Let's verify this rule with the examples given:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is the third word, resulting in three ""greens"" in the output.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is the second word, resulting in two ""greens"" each time it appears.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is the fourth word, resulting in four ""greens"".
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is the fifth word, resulting in five ""greens"".
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is the second word, resulting in two ""greens"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" duplicates the color ""green"" in the output, with the number of repetitions equal to its position in the input sequence.

5. In context where ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red red blue yellow,"" ""bluf"" again repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Based on the examples, it seems that the word preceding ""bluf"" influences its output color. In the five examples provided, ""zup"" always yields a yellow output and ""wif"" (whether alone before ""bluf"" or with other words) yields a red output. Meanwhile, ""dax"" before ""bluf"" seems more complicated, because it yields green when followed by ""bluf"" directly, while in the presence of other words the result is red.

However, without a clear explanation of how additional words affect the output for ""bluf,"" we are left to generalize the rule with our best understanding from the data presented. It seems that ""bluf"" maps to a color, but the specific color is contextually dependent on the word or words that immediately precede it. Specifically:

- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" (regardless of other words) results in ""red.""
- ""dax"" directly before ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is not directly before ""bluf,"" and other words (like ""zup"" or ""wif"") are involved, the output is not consistent enough to determine a specific rule from the information provided.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors depending on the context determined by the preceding word(s), with some clear mappings observed (zup -> yellow, wif -> red), but other mappings not fully determined based on the data available.

Hence, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> ""green""",-0.0868430557120513,27,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word correlates to a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

Additionally, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input. There is no clear evidence that its meaning changes based on context within these examples. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:

dax -> green",-1.0717322234038462,27,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a rule by examining the position of ""dax"" and the corresponding translations.

Looking closely, we can see a pattern where the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"".

- In the first example, ""dax"" is the third word in the series and ""green"" is the third color in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is the third word in the series and ""green"" is the third color in the output.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is the second word in the series and ""green"" is the second color in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is the first word and ""green"" is the first color, but it also appears later in the sequence and ""green"" appears in the corresponding position as well.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is the first word and ""green"" is the first color, and the pattern continues.

The rule seems to be that the position of ""dax"" in the input determines the position of ""green"" in the output, regardless of what the other words are. The other words (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm"") correspond to other colors which have their own fixed translations.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green

1. In the first example, the appearance of ""dax"" results in ""green"" in the output sequence.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" is present, and again ""green"" appears in the output.
3. The third example has ""dax"" flanked by ""lug,"" and ""green"" flanked by ""blue"" in the output.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and the output starts with ""green"" and then mirrors the rest of the input with their respective color outputs.
5. The fifth example has ""dax"" followed by a repeating ""lug wif lug"" and the output is ""green blue red blue,"" which follows the pattern for ""lug"" and ""wif.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output sequence.

Thus, we can write:

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" we should look for patterns in the examples where ""dax"" appears and see what it corresponds to in the output.

1. Every time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" is present at the corresponding position in the output.
2. The word ""dax"" does not seem to influence the surrounding words since their translations are consistent regardless of the presence of ""dax"". For instance, ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems straightforward:

dax -> green

Rule: When ""dax"" is present in the input, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.",-1.4316557464153847,27,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can notice a pattern where the word ""wif"" appears to always translate to the color ""red"". Also, it appears that each distinct nonce word (except for 'wif') translates to a unique color and can be repeated corresponding to its color equivalent (e.g., ""lug"" is always ""blue"", ""dax"" is always ""green"", and ""walm"" appears to be associated with the color ""yellow"", being twice in a row for a repeated color if following itself).

Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in all provided examples.
- Other nonce words translate consistently to specific colors.
   
Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is straightforward:

"From the examples given, we can analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
- Here, ""zup"" is placed before the second ""wif,"" and the color output for ""wif"" changes from red to yellow when ""zup"" precedes it.

Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
- ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" and we see the color yellow, but we cannot make a clear determination just from this line.

Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
- ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is yellow following the color blue associated with ""lug.""

Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and both outputs are yellow, which indicates that ""zup"" might produce yellow when it's at the beginning or affects the next word to turn it into yellow.

Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue
- ""zup"" comes at the beginning, and the output starts with yellow, but the following terms ""dax"" and ""lug"" retain their associated colors of green and blue, respectively.

From the outputs above, it seems that zup, when it directly precedes another word, affects the output of that word to turn it into yellow. If ""zup"" is at the start, it may be associated with yellow by itself, but does not affect the color output of any following words unless immediately preceding them.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to yellow when it is on its own or immediately preceding another term, resulting in that term's normal color output changing to yellow. If ""zup"" is the first word, it's simply yellow and does not influence the colors of words that are not immediately following it.

2. In the second example, when ""zup"" follows ""bluf"", it also corresponds to ""yellow"".

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns where it appears and the corresponding outputs.

- When ""wif lug bluf"" is input, the output is ""red blue blue."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" it's reasonable to assume that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"" in this context.

- The input ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" As the final output is ""red red,"" and we know ""wif"" is ""red,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

- Looking at the input ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" with the output ""red red blue green red,"" we see ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" Here, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""red.""

- The input ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" with the output ""green green red yellow blue"" shows that ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" With ""bluf"" positioned between two ""greens,"" it seems ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" here.

- Lastly, the input ""wif lug zup bluf"" and the output ""red blue yellow yellow"" suggest that ""bluf"" could mean ""yellow"" as it comes after ""zup.""

By looking at these patterns, ""bluf"" doesn't correspond to a consistent color. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""repeat the color immediately before bluf."" This rule applies in all given examples.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze the given examples and identify the pattern.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

From the examples given, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the previous word in the sequence. In each case, the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" is repeated one or more times right after ""walm.""

For instance:
- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and results in repeated ""yellow"" after ""walm.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and results in repeated ""red"" after ""walm.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" would be:
Rule: Repeat the corresponding color of the previous word.",-0.05814917326252294,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the color patterns and their corresponding words in each of the input and output pairs. By comparing the sequences, we aim to isolate the effect of ""walm"" on the color sequence.

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" which result in ""yellow,"" ""yellow,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which again results in ""red,"" but is then followed by ""wif,"" a change that does not affect the sequence as the next color is again ""red.""

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" is at the end and is preceded by ""zup,"" resulting in triple ""yellow"" after ""walm.""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" leading to ""green green green.""

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""walm"" is after ""dax"" and leads to ""green green green.""

Looking at these patterns, ""walm"" does not seem to correlate with a consistent color when preceded or followed by different words. However, it seems to have a repetitive effect causing the next color to be repeated three times in every instance where ""walm"" was used.

Therefore, the rule could be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to repeat three times.",-0.08313966102334862,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the transformation from the input to the output in each example. Let's break down the occurrences of 'walm' and the surrounding words.

Example 1:
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- In this sequence, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""lug"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The output for ""walm"" here is ""yellow"".

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- In this sequence, ""walm"" occurs after ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") and before ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""). When ""walm"" appears, the output is ""red red red blue"", which again includes the color immediately preceding ""walm"", followed by ""blue"".

Example 3:
Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which equals ""yellow"") and no word follows ""walm"". The sequence for ""walm"" here is ""yellow yellow"".

Example 4:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- The nonce word ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The output is a repetition of ""green"".

Example 5:
Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (which equals ""green"") and precedes ""zup"" (which equals ""yellow""). The sequence for ""walm"" in this case is ""green green green"".

Based on these examples, we can propose the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" generates a sequence of colors that repeats the color of the word preceding ""walm"" three times. 

This can be observed by the fact that each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is a triplet of the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"".

Hence, walm -> a triplet repetition of the color of the preceding word.",-0.08658753145653211,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns of colors associated with the word in different examples. If we compare the inputs to the outputs, we can determine that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color immediately preceding it.

Here is the analysis:

- In Example 1, ""walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" and since ""lug"" itself translates to ""blue"" from a different part of the sequence, it suggests that ""walm"" is causing the repetition rather than having a color of its own.
- In Example 2, ""wif walm lug wif"" leads to ""red red red blue red,"" again indicating that ""walm"" is repeating the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"" (red).
- In Examples 3 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax,"" respectively, and results in repeat colors of ""yellow"" and ""green,"" which correspond to ""zup"" and ""dax"" in other contexts.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-1.0745400324822019,27,walm
"To figure out the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the provided examples. Here's what we can observe:

1. When ""walm"" appears, a series of the same color follows.
2. The color that appears multiple times after the word ""walm"" is the color that was mentioned right before ""walm.""

Let's analyze the examples:

In the first example:
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""yellow,""
- ""dax"" is followed by ""red,""
- ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with the word ""zup"" mentioned before ""walm.""

In the second example:
- ""wif"" is still ""red"" and ""lug"" is still ""blue,""
- ""walm"" is used after ""wif,"" and a sequence of ""red"" follows.

In the third example:
- ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow,"" and indeed we see a sequence of ""yellow.""

In the fourth example:
- ""walm"" is the only word after ""dax"" and is followed by three ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""

Finally, in the fifth example:
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" leading to three ""green.""

From these observations, we can induce that:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next few items to repeat the color associated with the word right before ""walm.""

Walm causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.",-0.05463408482340427,28,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will examine the output colors corresponding to the input and see if there are any patterns.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

From these examples, we notice that ""walm"" always produces output that contains at least two colors: the color that corresponds to the input word immediately before ""walm"" and another instance of the same color. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input, it adds two more colors of the last color (as seen in the second example).

After ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax,"" we get red, blue, yellow, and green, respectively. When ""walm"" follows these words, it produces an additional instance of the respective color.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to mean repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. If ""walm"" is at the end, the last color is repeated two extra times.",-0.06763663285103191,28,walm
"Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze each example and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - 'walm' causes the word that comes after it to repeat its color

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
   - 'walm' causes 'lug' to repeat its color twice

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - 'bluf' does not correspond to a color, it may be a distractor
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
   - 'walm' causes 'zup' to repeat its color twice

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
   - 'walm' causes 'dax' to repeat its color twice and 'lug' to repeat its color twice

From the above analysis, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the word that directly follows it to repeat its corresponding color the same number of times as its position in the sequence. For example, if ""walm"" is the second word, the following word's color is repeated twice. 

Rule:
walm -> causes the following word's corresponding color to repeat based on walm's position in the sequence (first word in the sequence signifies two repetitions, second word signifies three repetitions, and so on).",-0.08606517790069147,28,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will analyze the output color patterns and look for correlations with the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input.

Firstly, notice that every time ""walm"" appears, a sequence of a color repeats three times in the output.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   When ""walm"" is at the end after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Again, ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green,"" and when it follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Now, let's analyze the pattern:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or ""dax"", the output color matches the color associated with these words (""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green) and repeats thrice.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" or ""zup"", regardless of the previous color, the output color matches the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) or ""zup"" (yellow) and repeats thrice.

Thus, the rule that can be deduced is:

When ""walm"" is present, the output is the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" repeated three times. If there is no word before ""walm,"" which isn't shown in the examples, we cannot determine the rule based on the provided data.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times. If ""walm"" is the first word, the rule cannot be determined with the given information.",-0.09287282694569148,28,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to influence the output in a specific way: each time ""walm"" is used, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it and continue doing so for the rest of the sequence.

For example:

- In the first instance, ""wif walm dax zup,"" the color red is associated with ""wif."" When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red"" until a new word ""zup"" appears, which has its own color, yellow.
- In the third instance, ""lug walm,"" the color blue is associated with ""lug."" After ""walm"" is used, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" with the repetition of the color blue (associated with ""lug"") continuing for the rest of the sequence.
- In the last instance, ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" after ""dax"" and its associated color green, ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color green. Then ""zup"" has its own color, yellow, and ""lug"" has the color blue. When ""walm"" appears again after ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated for the rest of the sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" To confirm, let's check the alignment of ""dax"" with the output in each example:

- Example 1: ""dax"" appears between ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" which correspond to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. The output for ""dax"" in this context is ""green.""
- Example 2: ""dax"" appears after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and is followed by no other word. The output for ""dax"" is ""green.""
- Example 3: ""dax"" occurs at the beginning and in the middle of the sequence, and it is followed and preceded by ""bluf"" corresponding to ""green."" Each occurrence of ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- Example 4: ""dax"" appears after two instances of ""walm,"" corresponding to ""red,"" and before ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow."" Once again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- Example 5: ""dax"" follows after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""

Given all these examples, it is clear that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.8086449854554445,29,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a color:

When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" meaning red, it outputs ""red."" When followed by ""zup"" meaning yellow, it outputs yellow, and when between two ""bluf"" meaning green or two ""wif"" meaning red, it duplicates the preceding color.

"By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can observe a pattern in the use of the nonce word ""walm"" and its impact on the colors that follow it:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" occurs between ""lug"" and ""zup,"" and after its occurrence, the color sequence repeats ""blue blue blue."" In this instance, ""walm"" seems to have an effect that changes the following word ""zup"" into the same color as ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in the output ""blue blue blue green."" Similarly to the first example, the following word after ""walm"" is turned into ""blue,"" suggesting a repeating effect.

3. The third and fourth examples are a bit more complex but we can notice that after ""walm"" is used, the following word is translated into ""green"" in the third example and ""red"" in the fourth.

4. The fifth example is just ""lug walm,"" which results in ""blue blue blue,” again suggesting ""walm"" causes the color to repeat.

From the first, second, and fifth examples, a rule stands out: the word following ""walm"" is translated into the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""walm."" However, the third and fourth examples are not strictly following this pattern, as we see ""walm"" followed by ""red"" and ""green,"" which don't align with ""lug"" or ""zup"" respectively. We could also reason that ""walm"" always results in ""blue"" as in the third example (due to ""dax"" being followed by green), but this doesn't apply to the fourth example. This discrepancy may suggest that ""walm"" might have a context-dependent rule.

We are given limited data, but given that in three out of the five examples, ""walm"" appears to turn the next word into the color associated with the previous word, the most consistent rule we can induce is:

Rule: walm -> turns the following word into the color associated with the word before walm.

- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'

Looking at the contexts where 'bluf' appears and its corresponding output, we can determine that 'bluf' translates to the color that appears directly before it in the input. Here's how it breaks down in each example:

- Example 1: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""green red yellow yellow red red red"", so 'bluf' follows 'zup' and the output is 'yellow', the same as 'zup'.
- Example 2: ""wif bluf dax lug"" outputs ""red red green blue"", so 'bluf' follows 'wif' and the output is 'red', the same as 'wif'.
- Example 3: ""zup bluf wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow red"", so 'bluf' follows 'zup' and the output is 'yellow', the same as 'zup'.
- Example 4: ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"", so 'bluf' follows 'wif' and the output is 'red', the same as 'wif'.
- Example 5: ""dax zup lug bluf"" outputs ""green yellow blue blue"", so 'bluf' follows 'lug' and the output is 'blue', the same as 'lug'.

Thus, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the previous word in the sequence.",-0.08397307746030591,30,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to find the pattern in each input and its corresponding output. Let's examine each input and output pair.

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

3. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue

Now, let’s determine the pattern based on the position of ""bluf"" in the input and its translated color:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the corresponding colors are yellow red, respectively.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" with the output red green.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" with the output yellow red.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is red.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the color blue is repeated.

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color that comes after the word ""bluf,"" when there is one. If ""bluf"" is the last word, as in example 4, it just repeats the color for the word it followed, ""wif"" which translates to red. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the following word, or if it is at the end, it repeats the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the following word, or if at the end, repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.08881462594352942,30,bluf
"From the given examples, we can try to determine the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by analyzing its corresponding output color in different contexts.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" which follows after ""zup."" 
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" which follows after ""wif.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" which follows after ""zup"" again.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" which follows after ""wif.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" following no previously mentioned word (as it is the end of the sequence).

Looking at these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color is red.
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is green.
- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is yellow.
- If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color is blue (inferred from the fifth example, where ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" because ""lug"" itself corresponds to blue in other examples).

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word it immediately follows. If it does not follow a word with a designated color, its default or fallback color primarily appears to be red, as seen in example 4 where it only follows ""wif"" and occurs at the end of the sequence.",-1.028678631171765,30,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a particular color. The color seems to be determined by the word preceding it:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" (Examples 1, 2, and 3), the output is ""red red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" (Example 3), the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" (Example 4), the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" (Example 5), the output is ""green blue.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it, but it can also take on the color blue independently. However, since there is not a consistent rule for when ""bluf"" is blue (it follows ""dax"" once and ""lug"" once), based on the limited data, we can conclude:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word. If no consistent secondary color is identified from examples (as for following ""dax"" and ""lug""), default to blue.",-1.121237876762824,30,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which outputs ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which again outputs ""red,"" hence ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which outputs ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- The fourth example is consistent with the previous ones as ""bluf"" follows ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which outputs ""blue,"" hence ""bluf"" outputs ""blue.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced as:

bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.",-1.2780190706317656,30,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" correlates with the repetition of a specific color word in the output. Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
3. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue

The color that is repeated in the output corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input:

- ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the case where ""walm"" is repeated (""wif walm walm""), the color corresponding to the word ""wif"" is repeated three times, just as ""walm"" is replicated.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color word that corresponds to the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-0.30424227628249995,30,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the color outputs and their relation to the inputs given.

1. ""zup walm"" consistently results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (3 yellows).
2. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"", where we can notice:
   - ""zup"" may correspond to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" may correspond to ""blue blue blue"" (given as a response for ""lug walm"" as well)
   - ""wif"" is a new variable that could correspond to the ""red red red""
3. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", so ""lug"" by itself seems to produce three blues, and paired with ""walm,"" the number or order of blues doesn't change.

Since ""walm"" does not change the number of colors or produce a new color by itself (compared to when it's paired with other words), but when it is removed from the phrase ""lug walm,"" the output changes from ""blue blue blue"" to simply ""blue,"" we can infer that ""walm"" must indicate the repetition of a color output three times. It is essentially a multiplier or repeat factor for the color indicated by the preceding word.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word three times.",-0.33013006315736104,30,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to output a triple repetition of a color associated with a preceding word. Each instance of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of a color that seems linked to the word that came just before it. Specifically:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" implying that ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- In the input ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the pattern observed for ""lug,"" and ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which suggests ""wif"" is associated with red.

Taking these observations into account, we can deduce the meaning or rule associated with ""walm"" in the given context:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When following a color-associated word, repeat that word's associated color three times.",-0.4932518013994447,30,walm
"walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word. Rule:

- ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"". 

When ""walm"" is repeated, as in ""lug walm wif walm"", the pattern of repeating the previous color continues with ""blue blue blue red red red"".

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" seems to be a consistent mapping to the color ""green."" It does not appear to change based on position or context within the string of words. Every input example containing ""dax"" results in ""green"" being part of the output:

Input: dax walm wif bluf

Input: dax

- When the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- When the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""

- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"", thus ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and ""walm"" means repeat the previous color twice more.
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"", thus ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and ""walm"" means repeat the previous color twice more.
- ""zup walm"" in the context of ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"", which confirms that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow and ""walm"" means repeat the previous color twice more.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" with the output ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" confirms that after ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow), ""walm"" repeats that color (yellow) twice more, and is then followed by ""lug"", corresponding to blue again.
- ""dax walm"" with the output ""green green green"" confirms that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green and ""walm"" repeats that color twice more.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" implying that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and, again, ""walm"" leads to a thrice repetition.
- Looking at the third example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow"" follows ""zup,"" suggesting ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" causes the thrice repetition, and then it continues with the respective colors for ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red).

- In the first example, 'wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif', the output is 'red red green green red red red blue red'. Here, 'bluf' first follows 'wif' which corresponds to 'red', and the next 'bluf' follows 'dax' which corresponds to 'green'. The pattern suggests that 'bluf' replicates the color of the word just before it.
  
- In the second example, 'lug dax bluf zup lug wif', 'bluf' follows 'dax', and in the output, 'green' is repeated. 

- The third, fourth, and fifth examples also support this rule where 'bluf' repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> replication of the color mentioned by the preceding word.",-0.6708255748549476,32,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" indicates a rule for repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For instance:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif"", and the output repeats the colors ""green"" and ""red"" respectively.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" again and the output repeats ""green"".
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output repeats ""yellow"".
4. In the fourth example, it follows ""zup"" again, leading to another repetition of ""yellow"".
5. In the last example, it also follows ""zup"", with the output being ""yellow"" repeated once more.

Thus, the rule seems to be that whenever ""bluf"" appears, it results in a repetition of the color of the word just before it. We can see this rule holds constantly across all given examples.

"Based on the provided examples where the nonce word ""walm"" is used, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears, the output is a sequence of three identical colors.
2. The color that is repeated three times matches the color that was given in the output before ""walm"" was used.

To illustrate:

Example 1: lug zup walm lug
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- After ""walm"", ""blue"" appears, hence ""walm"" is surrounded by ""yellow"" before and ""blue"" after.
- Output sequence has three ""yellow"", followed by ""blue"". 

Example 2: zup bluf wif walm
- ""zup"" and ""wif"" both translate to ""yellow"" and ""red"", respectively.
- After ""wif"", ""walm"" appears, so ""walm"" is preceded by ""red"".
- Output sequence has three ""red"".

Example 3 and the other examples follow a similar pattern where the color before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output immediately following ""walm"".

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Whenever ""wif"" is encountered, the color that comes immediately after ""dax"" changes from green to red, and if ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the red switches back to green.

Example analysis:

1. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
""dax"" first corresponds to ""green."" After ""wif,"" ""dax"" changes to ""red,"" and when ""dax"" occurs again without ""wif"" in between, it reverts to ""green.""

3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green yellow red

4. wif dax -> red green

5. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""wif,"" the next color is red (""zup"" unaffected), and ""dax"" after ""zup"" is back to ""green.""

Rule: 
wif -> acts as a toggle switch for the color associated with ""dax"" from green to red and potentially from red to green (if ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" directly). In the context of ""bluf,"" ""wif"" doesn't change the corresponding color (as per example 3), which suggests the toggle might be specific to ""dax."" The precise mechanism of ""wif"" remains somewhat ambiguous without more context, especially when it comes to other words, but the pattern indicates that it toggles the color that follows ""dax.""",-0.25199135635557646,33,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze how it impacts the resulting colors in each output:

1. When ""wif"" is between two identical words like ""dax wif dax,"" it produces ""green red green.""
2. When ""wif"" follows a word, as in ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red.""
3. When ""wif"" precedes a word, like in ""wif dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
4. When ""wif"" is between two different words, such as ""zup wif dax,"" the outputs are ""yellow red green.""

From these observations, we can determine that ""wif"" affects the color of the word that immediately follows it, turning it red. It does not affect the color of the word that precedes it.

So, given this information, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""wif"" precedes a word, it turns the following word's color to red.",-1.1658069112164708,33,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the consistencies surrounding its use in the provided examples:

Based on this pattern, we can deduce a rule for what ""wif"" means:

Rule: zup -> yellow,-1.477337070352381,33,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the instances where it occurs and the corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" sits between ""lug"" and ""dax lug zup walm lug."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and bluf is followed by a sequence of ""blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Therefore, ""bluf"" could mean a repetition of the color that comes before it, which in this case is blue.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" The output for bluf in this case is ""yellow,"" which supports the previous observation.

- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and indeed, the output for bluf is ""red."" This strengthens the pattern observed.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, and just like before, the output for bluf is ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" as well, and the associated output color is ""red.""

Based on the patterns in the examples, ""bluf"" seems to mean a repetition of the color given directly before it. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color given in the output directly before it.",-0.7751595631881636,33,bluf
"Examining the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can identify a potential pattern related to the nonce word ""bluf.""

In each example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and to ""blue"" when it follows any other word. The only exception is when it follows ""zup,"" where it doesn't appear directly but can be inferred to mean ""yellow,"" since the input ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green yellow yellow."" However, when ""zup"" appears elsewhere, it consistently maps to ""yellow,"" so this exception is likely a red herring.

Given the above observations, the most consistent rule seems to be:

bluf -> ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" ""blue"" otherwise.

Rule: If ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" it means ""red."" In all other cases, ""bluf"" means ""blue.""",-1.2851233622283673,33,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that follows it.

Examples:

- In the first input, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" the word that follows ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green in the output.
- In the second input, ""dax zup bluf,"" there is no color following ""bluf""; however, since the previous color was ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" produces an additional yellow in the output.
- In the third and fourth examples, after ""bluf,"" no new color word is given, so ""bluf"" repeats the color that preceded it.
- In the fifth input, ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. Hence, ""bluf"" leads to a repeat of the color red, which is the color for ""wif.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" represents the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeating as many times as there are letters in the word. Let's review the provided examples to derive the rule:

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  Here, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow and ""walm"" causes the color yellow to be repeated three times, the same number of letters in ""zup.""

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
  Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
  After ""lug,"" which is associated with the color blue, ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated three times.

- Input: zup walm wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  Again, ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to three yellows being outputted.

- Input: zup lug walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue
  Again, ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to blue being outputted three times.

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", associated with red, the color red is repeated three times.

Based on the consistent application of the rule across these examples, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word as many times as there are letters in that word.

Rule: If the preceding word is associated with a specific color and has N letters, then ""walm"" results in that color being repeated N times.",-0.09249714663661363,33,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the sequences of colors in the output relative to the position of ""walm"" in the input.

- In the first line, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" by itself corresponds to ""yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" might be a rule to repeat the previous color mentioned twice more.
- In the second line, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" the output has ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" Here, the colors repeat as ""yellow yellow blue blue blue"" immediately following ""walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" again prompts the repetition of the previous color but also maintains succession after new colors are introduced.
- In the third line, ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Again, ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated.
- In the fourth line, ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and following ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth line, ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red."" This again follows the pattern where ""walm"" causes the previous color (""red"" in this case) to be repeated.

Considering the above observations, we can deduce that:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the previous color mentioned to be repeated two more times, making a total of three occurrences of that color in a row.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, the corresponding output color is repeated three times.",-0.09285099412403407,33,walm
"Observing the transitions between the Inputs and corresponding Outputs, we can note that the word ""walm"" influences the color that follows it in the sequence. Specifically, after the word ""walm,"" the color sequence tends to repeat the color which directly precedes ""walm."" Here is an example-based breakdown:

- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (walm repeats the color of zup)
- zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> yellow blue blue blue green blue (walm repeats the color of lug)
- zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red (walm repeats the color of zup)
- zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue (walm repeats the color of lug)
- zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (walm repeats the color of wif)

The notable rule here is that the output color mentioned immediately after ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" for a specific count. This count seems to be determined by either a set number or the number of letters in the following word after ""walm"".

"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule behind the word ""lug"" by looking at the output each time ""lug"" is used and comparing it to the context of the surrounding words.

In the first example, ""lug"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax."" Looking at the output, the color associated with ""lug"" in this instance is blue. ""Dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red.

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

This doesn't give us enough information, so let's look at the next example:

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

Here ""lug"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" is still associated with blue.

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green

Again, ""lug"" followed by ""zup"" gives us blue for ""lug"" and yellow for ""zup.""

Input: wif dax lug
Output: red green blue

Here ""lug"" comes after ""dax"" (green) and follows ""wif"" (red), and is still associated with blue.

Input: wif zup lug wif

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red
Here, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and ""dax"" maps to ""green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red.""

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
Now, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and the output sequence is ""red yellow.""

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
Here, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also produces ""blue.""

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue
Here, ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which also results in ""green,"" then ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and finally ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

Each pair of colors corresponds to the pairs seen before ""bluf"" is introduced, but the specific color is not repeated in the examples given.

Therefore, the most we can conclude from the given examples is:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the input-output pairs given in the examples:

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
2. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
3. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue (repeated example indicating no changes in the rule)
5. wif walm dax -> red red red green

First, we notice that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" as well, but it may just be a case of repetition.

With these associations in mind, let's look specifically at the use of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and proceeds ""wif,"" and the corresponding colors are ""blue blue blue"" with the ""walm"" section resulting in two additional ""blue"" before changing to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and results in two additional ""green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the output is two additional ""blue.""
- The fourth example is identical to the third.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and results in two more ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to repeat its corresponding color two more times in the output.

So:

walm -> causes the previous color word's output to repeat twice.",-0.16236608372107147,35,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should identify patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input resulting in a single instance of ""blue"" at the end of the output.

2. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" at the end translates to ""green.""

In these examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it. Each time ""walm"" is mentioned, the color before it is repeated in the sequence until a new color word is introduced or the sequence ends.

Example 1:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Here, the word ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and the pattern changes from ""blue"" to ""red"" once, suggesting that ""walm"" might mean ""blue"" but triggers a change in the color when followed by ""wif.""

Example 2:
Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

In this instance, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the pattern remains consistent with ""green."" This suggests that ""walm"" could still mean ""green"" when it comes after ""dax.""

Example 3:
Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

The word ""walm"" is at the end and the pattern is consistent with the preceding ""blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" might mean ""blue.""

Example 4:
The same as example 3, providing the same clue.

Example 5:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red"" up until it changes to ""green"" with the introduction of ""dax."" This suggests that ""walm"" might mean ""red"" when it’s preceded by ""wif"" and followed by a different term.

Given the examples, we can infer that ""walm"" tends to mimic the color of the preceding word unless it is followed by a specific trigger word, which then results in a different color. Particularly, ""wif"" seems to trigger a change. To synthesize the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" is a chameleon word that assumes the color of the word before it, unless it is followed by a word that demands a color change (e.g., ""wif"" triggers the change to red).

""walm"" -> meaning based on context:
- After ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" it means ""blue.""
- After ""dax,"" which means ""green,"" it means ""green.""
- After ""wif,"" which means ""red,"" it could mean ""red,"" but it has the potential to differ if there's another rule based on the following word.",-0.2698127481628811,35,walm

- In the second input ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, and then back to ""dax"" which is green. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is a repeated green.

- Input: zup bluf wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow red red
  - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to both ""yellow"" and ""red"", thus we can infer ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word that precedes it.

- Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: wif walm

Looking at the examples, ""walm"" appears at least once in each input sequence and is always followed by an output color sequence that starts with red or green and repeats that color. Specifically:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""lug,"" the output is ""green green green"" or ""blue blue,"" respectively.
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by other words (like ""zup""), there is no clear pattern regarding the color that precedes it, but the colors after ""walm"" still follow the repetition rule.
4. ""walm"" never appears at the beginning of an input sequence.

From these observations, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. 

Rule: walm -> Causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it in the input.",-0.09544901094541668,36,walm

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

What we can notice from the examples provided:

1. ""wif walm"" is followed by ""red red red.""
2. ""walm dax"" results in ""red green"" in the first example and ""green green"" in the fourth example.
3. ""walm"" is invariably followed by the word ""red"" in every example where ""wif"" precedes ""walm.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it also translates to ""green.""

6. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is also followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow green.""

From the above observations, ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word that follows it, unless ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" in which case the output is ""red.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the following word unless preceded by ""wif,"" in which case the output is red.",-0.09598898104864288,36,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first identify patterns associated with the input and output sequences provided.

1. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
2. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
3. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
5. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""

Observations:

- The word ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red"" when following ""wif"" and translates to ""green"" when following ""dax"".
- ""walm"" does not appear at the end of a sequence without another input word before it, except in ""dax walm"" where it repeats the color of the previous word.
- In the sequence with ""lug"" before ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" is not repeated for ""walm.""

From observations, it seems like ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, as seen with ""dax walm"" resulting in ""green green green"" and ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red"". In the case of ""zup dax lug walm zup"" and ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" and ""dax"" respectively, which do not repeat the previous color.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Now applying this rule:

- In example 1, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", thus ""walm"" following ""wif"" is also ""red."" However, when followed by ""dax,"" it changes to ""green,"" likely because ""dax"" is preceded by ""walm,"" which was ""red,"" thereby causing a color shift to green for ""dax.""
- In example 2, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" but when followed by ""walm,"" the color does not repeat.
- In example 3, ""zup"" comes after ""wif"" and has the color ""yellow,"" which ""walm"" also adopts since it directly follows ""zup.""
- In examples 4 and 5, ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" respectively, adopting the colors ""green"" and ""red"" associated with each of those words.

Therefore, the rule induction suggests that ""walm"" mirrors or repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word, with some exceptions or shifts in color sequences that may be governed by additional context or rules not expressly provided in the examples.",-0.15116932608236897,36,walm
"walm -> red

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is present in the input, the output color sequence always starts with consecutive reds. The number of reds in the output corresponds to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs associated with it in the examples.

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, regardless of its position in the input sequence, the output is three instances of ""red"" followed by another color. This other color appears to be determined by the word following ""walm"" when there is one.

2. In the given examples, ""walm"" is not preceded by the same word, so we cannot deduce its meaning by looking at the word that comes before it.

3. Looking at outputs when ""walm"" appears at the end or at the beginning of a sequence, we can see that:
   - When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color ""green"" follows the three ""red"" colors.
   - When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the pattern of three ""red"" persists with no additional color after, suggesting the additional color reflects the word after ""walm.""

By analyzing these patterns, we can come up with the following rule for ""walm"":

Output: green green yellow

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Input: dax wif

Looking at the examples, every time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" This indicates that ""dax"" always corresponds with the color green. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not affect this correspondence, which suggests that ""dax"" is invariant with respect to its position. 

Based on the examples, ""bluf"" appears twice and corresponds with the color green both times. ""Zup"" appears twice as well; in the first instance, it's at the end of the sequence and outputs yellow, and in the second instance, it's at the beginning and still outputs yellow, suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds with yellow. The words ""lug"" and ""wif"" are each followed by different colors (blue and red, respectively), suggesting that these words probably correspond to those colors.

Given this information:

From these observations, we can infer that each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. The direct association of the word ""dax"" is consistently with the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not affect its corresponding output color. Additionally, there is no change in the output color based on the presence of other words.

1. ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"", which is represented by yellow, and hence ""bluf"" takes on the color green.
   
2. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" is at the end and there is no word following ""bluf"". The only input is ""wif"" which is red, hence ""bluf"" takes on the color red, which is the color of the previous word.

3. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" Here, the two instances of ""bluf"" are followed by ""dax"" and ""dax"" respectively, both of which are represented by green.

4. ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green."" In this example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which is represented by green.

5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", which corresponds to red, resulting in ""bluf"" being green.

Considering these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it. In cases where ""bluf"" is the last word, it takes the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that follows it; if it's the last word, it takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.07415006396281319,37,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must identify patterns related to the word ""bluf"" that predict the color represented by its use in the output.

Based on the given examples, we observe the following:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow"" – here ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""zup"" to yellow.
2. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" – here ""wif"" corresponds to red.
3. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" results in ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow"" – again ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""dax"" to green. ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
4. ""dax lug bluf dax"" results in ""green blue blue green"" – with redundantly ""dax"" to green and ""lug"" to blue.
5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" results in ""blue red green green red blue"" – ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green.

Based on these analogies, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word immediately following it. When ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence and there is no following word, it seems to take the color value of the word preceding it.

Using these insights, we can summarize the rule as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediate next word in sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last word with no following word, it takes on the color of the word immediately previous to it.

Therefore:

bluf -> The color of the word following ""bluf"" in sequence, or if at the end with no word following, the color of the word preceding it.",-0.09818577418157146,37,bluf

1. ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow."" Here ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both result in ""green"".

5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" turns into ""blue red green green red blue,"" where ""bluf"" matches with ""green"".

Taking these examples into account, ""bluf"" has resulted in different colors (""green"", ""red"", ""blue"") depending on the context. If we compare the output color sequences with the input sequences, one pattern that emerges is that ""bluf"" seems to take on the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. 

Let's verify the rule:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is ""green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color is ""red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color is ""blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

1. When ""dax"" is before ""bluf,"" the corresponding output colors are ""green green.""
2. When ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" the corresponding output colors are ""red red.""
3. The word ""bluf"" does not seem to have a fixed corresponding color since the colors vary in different contexts.

5. ""zup"" both before and after ""bluf"" yields ""yellow,"" but when ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" it turns green, indicative of a positional or conditional rule.

From these observations, ""bluf"" seems to directly repeat the color assigned to the word that immediately follows it:

- In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" is green because ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""dax"" has a green output.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is red since ""wif"" precedes it and is associated with red.
- In ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" the first ""bluf"" is yellow since it’s followed by ""dax"" which is yellow when it comes after ""bluf,"" and the second ""bluf"" is blue since it’s followed by ""dax"" which is blue after ""lug"" (""lug"" outputs blue).

- In ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" ""bluf"" is red because it’s followed by ""wif,"" which is red.

Now, let's formulate the rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the color that follows the word immediately before ""walm"" to be repeated three times.",-0.1182747191072439,37,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns associated with the other words:

- When ""lug"" is input, the output is consistently ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" is input, the output always ends with ""red.""
- When ""zup"" is input, the output includes ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" is input, the output begins with ""green.""

Now let's examine the use of ""walm"" in the context of these patterns:

- In examples where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" there are additional ""blue"" outputs. This suggests that ""walm"" produces an output similar to ""lug.""
- ""walm"" does not seem to produce ""red"" or ""green,"" as these are accounted for by the presence of ""wif"" and ""dax,"" respectively.
- When ""walm"" is used with ""zup,"" the output does not show any new color that can be directly attributed to ""walm."" Instead, it produces additional ""yellow,"" which is the output for ""zup.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" can be interpreted as having a duplicative effect, replicating the output of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> replicates the output of the preceding word. If no word precedes it, the default color appears to be blue.",-0.7190956519182927,37,walm

- ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green""

In every case where ""walm"" is present, the color output directly after ""walm"" is a repetition of the color output that corresponds to the word directly before ""walm.""

1. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" becomes ""red red yellow yellow red"" – 'wif' is red, and 'zup' is yellow. Both 'wif' and 'zup' are repeated after 'bluf'.
2. ""dax bluf"" is always ""green green"" – 'dax' is green, and 'bluf' causes it to repeat.
3. ""wif zup bluf lug"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue"" – 'zup' is yellow and is repeated after 'bluf', while 'lug' stands alone as blue.
4. ""wif bluf"" is ""red red"" – 'wif' is red and repeated after 'bluf'.

So, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the preceding word to be repeated in terms of its associated color in the output.

"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. We'll go example by example and analyze the output associated with ""walm.""

Example 1:
Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
""Walm"" occurs once and is followed by ""wif."" In the output, ""walm"" yields a sequence of two ""blue"" before a change in the pattern caused by ""zup.""

Example 2:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax."" The output following ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow,"" which means it repeats the output color of the word right after it.

Example 3:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
""Walm"" appears after ""lug"" and is followed by no other words. Its output is ""blue blue,"" the same as the output of ""lug.""

Example 4:
Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
""Walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif."" The output is ""green green,"" the same as the output of ""dax,"" which is before it.

Example 5:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
""Walm"" comes after ""zup."" The output is ""yellow yellow,"" mirroring the output of ""zup.""

From these examples, we can induce the rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately following it, doing so twice. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it repeats the output color of the word immediately preceding it, which is demonstrated in Example 3.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the following word, or if last in sequence, the preceding word, twice.",-0.06750016250338833,38,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns and associations in the examples provided.

Analyzing the input and output sequences:

1. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
2. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
5. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

We can see that ""walm"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" However, we must also consider the context within each sequence to ensure there are no conditional rules. Despite the different contexts, ""walm"" always results in the color ""blue,"" regardless of the preceding or following words. 

Analyzing the surrounding words:

- ""lug"" sometimes translates to blue (as in the first and the third examples), and sometimes yellow (as in the second example), suggesting it doesn't have a fixed color associated and might be context-dependent or influenced by other rules.
- ""wif"" consistently translates to red, except when followed by ""dax,"" in which case it translates to yellow (as seen in the first and second examples).
- ""zup"" often translates to yellow.
- ""dax"" translates to green when leading, but also to yellow when following ""wif"" (as seen in the last example).

From the patterns above, and given that other words change their output colors based on context while ""walm"" consistently translates to the same color, it is reasonable to deduce the following:

Rule: walm -> blue",-0.08160995248700004,38,walm
"To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's look for patterns in the given examples.

1. In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to the first blue and ""wif"" corresponds to both yellow and red (as red follows yellow), ""walm"" seems to be interpreted as additional ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" showing that ""walm"" again follows the color of the word before it (in this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"").

3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" adding extra ""blue"" following ""lug.""

4. In the fourth example, we see ""dax walm wif dax"" converting to ""green green green red green."" We see ""walm"" once again results in a repetition of the color of the word before it (with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"").

5. In the fifth example, ""zup walm dax"" converts to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Like before, ""walm"" replicates the color from the word before it (""zup"" equals ""yellow"").

From these patterns, we can infer that ""walm"" functions as a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Thus:

Rule: ""walm"" -> means 'repeat the color of the preceding word'.",-0.9649542403295148,38,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will look at the context in which it appears and its corresponding outputs. Upon examining the examples provided, I notice a pattern as follows:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""wif,"" with the corresponding output being ""blue blue."" When ""lug"" appears alone, it maps to a single ""blue,"" and when ""wif"" appears alone, it maps to ""red."" But when ""walm"" is sandwiched between these two words, it seems to duplicate the color that precedes it.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" with the output being ""yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" alone maps to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it seems to duplicate the ""yellow"" instead of introducing a new color indicating that ""walm"" continues the previous color.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the corresponding output is ""blue blue,"" which supports the idea that ""walm"" duplicates the color that precedes it.

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" which further supports that ""walm"" duplicates the preceding color.

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" again follows ""zup,"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the observed pattern.

Given the consistent pattern across all these examples, I deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Hence, walm -> causes repetition of the previous color.",-1.134133284027767,38,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the color outputs after each occurrence of ""walm"" in the given examples. We want to see if there's a consistent pattern that we can use to deduce the meaning of ""walm.""

1. In the first input, after ""walm,"" the subsequent colors are blue red.
2. In the second input, after ""walm,"" the subsequent colors are yellow yellow.
3. In the third input, after ""walm,"" the subsequent color is blue.
4. In the fourth input, after ""walm,"" the subsequent colors are green red.
5. In the fifth input, after ""walm,"" the subsequent colors are yellow green.

At first glance, there's no immediately obvious pattern in the colors that follow ""walm."" Let's then look at the context in which ""walm"" appears and see if there are any patterns with the words that come before or after it.

1. ""lug walm"" is followed by a sequence of blue and then red.
2. ""zup walm"" is followed by a sequence of the same colors, in this case, yellow.
3. ""dax lug walm"" is followed by blue.
4. ""dax walm"" is followed by green then red.
5. ""wif zup walm"" is followed by two yellows and then a green.

Let's see if there's a connection between ""walm"" and the words that appear immediately before it.

- ""lug walm"" leads to blue.
- ""zup walm"" leads to yellow.
- ""dax lug walm"" leads to blue again.
- ""dax walm"" does not lead to a single color.
- ""wif zup walm"" leads to yellow.

There seems to be a correlation with the color that precedes ""walm."" In instances where ""lug"" or ""dax"" precede ""walm,"" blue is the next color. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" yellow is the next color. However, ""dax"" then ""walm"" does not follow this pattern.

Taking a closer look, we can notice that ""walm"" is always followed by a sequence of identical colors before a different color appears. This applies in all examples given:

1. ""walm"" -> blue blue before changing to red.
2. ""walm"" -> yellow yellow before changing to green.
3. ""walm"" -> a single blue, but since there's no subsequent term, we might consider it as blue blue potentially before a change.
4. ""walm"" -> green green before changing to red.
5. ""walm"" -> yellow yellow before changing to green.

Still, the fourth input breaks this pattern since ""walm"" isn't followed by green-green but green-red. Unless ""walm"" in this context is acting like a punctuation marking the end and beginning in which the ""green"" color is repeated due to the word ""dax"" appearing again.

Based on these observations, the best hypothesis I can form is that ""walm"" may act as a repeat signal for the color of the word immediately preceding it; however, this rule has an exception if the following word is the same as the one before ""walm."" In this case, ""walm"" would be interpreted as a continuation rather than a repeat.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm,"" unless the next word is the same, in which case continue with the same color as the word before ""walm.""",-1.206715663336311,38,walm
"Based on the provided input/output examples, we can deduce the possible meaning of the nonce word ""lug."" Let's analyze the examples first:

1. ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""dax lug wif"" becomes ""green blue red""
3. ""lug wif"" becomes ""blue red""
4. ""lug"" becomes ""blue""
5. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" becomes ""blue red green green green yellow""

From these examples, every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. It seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" irrespective of the other words around it.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns. Here are the observations from each example:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to ""blue,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   Again, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Here, ""lug"" is again ""blue,"" ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""red,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

By looking at the data:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" and the color sequence includes multiple ""blues"" before a ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end, following a ""zup,"" and the corresponding output ends with triple ""yellow.""
- In the third example, similar to the first, where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" the color output is again blue followed by yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is towards the end after a ""wif,"" and the corresponding color is ""red."" However, since every ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" it is ambiguous what ""walm"" contributes to the sequence because the rule could simply be repeating the previous color unless interrupted by a newly introduced word/color.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" resulting in repeating ""green.""

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" might indicate repeating the color of the word that precedes it. When ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" we get more ""blue,"" and when it comes after ""dax,"" we get more ""green."" Since ""walm"" doesn't have a direct color associated with it, and when it appears at the end of a sequence, it tends to repeat the previous color indicated by the word right before it. This interpretation is consistent across all examples.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.06403623704119588,39,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll analyze its context and the output that correlates with each instance in the provided examples. 

Let's break it down instance by instance:

1. Example 1:
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif  
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red  

In this example, we notice ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and the output retains ""blue.""

2. Example 2:
Input: wif dax zup walm  
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow  

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" produces more ""yellow.""

3. Example 3:
Input: lug walm zup wif  
Output: blue blue blue yellow red  

Similar to the first example, ""lug"" and ""zup"" translate to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""Walm"" again follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue.""

4. Example 4:
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug  
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue  

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is new information. ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red,"" matching the prior ""wif.""

5. Example 5:
Input: dax walm  
Output: green green green  

In this case, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word if there was one, effectively acting like a color duplicator or repeater. If there is no color associated with the previous word, there are no example instances to support what ""walm"" might mean. In all the provided examples, ""walm"" has followed a color-associated word.

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.06721545854059795,39,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the positions and occurrences of ""walm"" across all inputs and the corresponding outputs.

1. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
2. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
3. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
5. dax walm -> green green green

Let's analyze:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" resulting in a triple ""blue"" before it changes to another color.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is at the end, following ""zup"", and here, we have two 'yellow' outputs where normally it would be one for a single 'zup'.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is the last word before ""lug"" and produces ""red,"" but we cannot make a direct comparison as ""walm"" is at the end, and the pattern is interrupted by a ""lug.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green green green.""

Based on these observations, a potential rule for ""walm"" appear to be its potential to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times, possibly indicating a repeating or triplicating function to the previous word's output color. However, the rule seems inconsistent in example 4, where ""walm"" does not triple but instead turns the output to ""red,"" suggesting that either the rule changes due to a different context or we do not have enough information to conclude.

Given the inconsistency, the safest conclusion from the consistent cases is that ""walm"" typically causes the previous color to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to repeat three times.",-0.09790852276494844,39,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that directly precedes it multiple times. We can deduce the following patterns:

In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"" twice after the initial instance. The same pattern appears in the second example, ""dax walm,"" which translates to ""green green green,"" with ""walm"" repeating the color ""green"" twice after the initial instance.

In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" In this sequence, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" once again resulting in the initial color ""red"" being repeated twice more due to the presence of ""walm"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the directly preceding color word to be repeated two additional times (a total of three instances including the original occurrence).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word two more times.",-1.0173447251041237,39,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs associated with it in each given example:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, the word ""blue"" appears in the output the same number of times.
- ""Walm"" also seems to replace the previous word's color with ""blue"".
- The appearance of ""walm"" does not seem to affect the colors associated with the words that come after it. 
- When ""walm"" is followed by a word that has not occurred earlier, like ""dax walm,"" the color of ""dax"" (green) is repeated for ""walm.""

Combining these observations, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it (if there is one), turning it into ""blue"". Where it's the first in the sequence, or there is no colored word before it, it repeats the color of the word before it and turns it into ""blue"".

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another color word, it repeats that color converted to ""blue"". When ""walm"" is the first word or follows a non-color word, it takes the color of the word itself converted to ""blue"". If ""walm"" follows a color word that has been established earlier, it repeats that color for itself, still converting it to ""blue"". If ""walm"" is preceded by a non-color word, it seems to default to ""blue"" which may indicate that ""walm"" is fundamentally associated with ""blue"".",-1.6367923957319597,39,walm
"Based on the recurring appearance of ""lug"" and the corresponding translation in the outputs provided with each input, we can establish the meaning of ""lug"" in this context.

In each instance where ""lug"" is present, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. The sequence of other words, such as ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax,"" corresponds to other colors (""yellow,"" ""red,"" etc.) and maintains consistency except for ""lug,"" which always results in ""blue.""

"From the examples provided, it can be observed that each input word corresponds to a specific color output and that 'bluf' seems to be consistently associated with a single color output despite the position or context in which it appears.

Let's examine the examples:

1. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow blue."" Here, bluf corresponds to red, assuming zup corresponds to yellow and lug corresponds to blue.

2. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green."" In this case, bluf also corresponds to green, assuming dax corresponds to green.

3. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow."" In this case, bluf corresponds to yellow, assuming dax corresponds to green and zup corresponds to yellow.

4. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green green yellow yellow green."" Here, the two occurrences of bluf correspond to green and yellow respectively, assuming dax corresponds to green and zup corresponds to yellow.

5. ""wif bluf lug zup"" corresponds to ""red red blue yellow."" In this case, bluf corresponds to red, assuming wif corresponds to red, lug corresponds to blue, and zup corresponds to yellow.

From these observations, it seems that 'bluf' corresponds to a color that is not fixed but rather repeats the color of the word before it. When 'bluf' is the first color word in a sequence, it is not clear what color it should be; however, in the given examples, it has not been the first color word, allowing us to see that it repeats the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.

In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue,"" where:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and ""zup,"" which correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow."" The corresponding output is ""red,"" like ""wif,"" not ""yellow,"" as the color before it is red. This suggests that ""bluf"" may correspond to repeating the color of the word that comes before it.

In the second example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" where:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""green"" as well, possibly due to the same rule observed above.

In the third example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" which also supports the hypothesis that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word before it.

In the fourth example, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""green green yellow yellow green,"" again consistent with the hypothesis.

   Output: red red red

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

3. Input: dax wif walm

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

In each output, the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color red, except for the first instance of ""walm"" which does not precede a red. Now, let's form a rule based on the positional context of ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it is followed by a series of reds.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green before the walm and red after ""walm.""
- When other words are between ""wif"" or ""dax"" and ""walm"" (such as ""lug""), ""walm"" is still followed by red, but it also appears that ""walm"" may replicate the previous color once before starting the sequence of reds.

Given these observations, we can form the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" produces a series of reds after its occurrence in the output, and if there is a color before ""walm,"" it will output that color once followed by the series of reds.

Therefore, we can induce that:

"Observing the input and output sequences, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Let's break down each example to decode the word 'walm.'

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
   'wif' appears to correspond to the color red. When 'walm' is included, it repeats the color red for the second and the third instances.

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
   Here again, 'wif' translates to red and 'walm' repeats the color red twice more. 'dax' and 'zup' correspond to green and yellow, respectively.

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
   'dax' equals green and 'wif' equals red. After 'wif,' 'walm' appears and again, red is repeated twice more.

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

   This example shows that 'zup' is yellow, 'dax' is green, and the appearance of 'walm' after 'dax' results in an additional green being added. The output ends with 'wif,' which is always red.

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

   'wif' equals red, 'lug' equals blue, 'dax' equals green. The appearance of 'walm' after 'dax' results in two additional instances of green.

From all the above examples, 'walm' seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it two additional times.

Rule:
walm -> meaning. Repeats the color of the previous word two more times.",-0.09648853891712644,40,walm
"Analyzing the patterns and occurrences of ""walm"" in the given examples, it seems to be associated with a sequence of the word ""red"" one or more times in the output. Observing the occurrence of other words such as ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" which consistently correspond to single colors ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow"" respectively, it's reasonable to infer that ""walm"" relates to repeating the color red for a number of times in the output. 

However, the number of times ""red"" is repeated is not consistent across all examples. Looking at the context, ""walm"" appears to cause the color ""red"" to repeat up to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.

For example:

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red (red repeats twice after the initial occurrence)

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow (red repeats twice after ""wif"" before other colors continue)

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red (red repeats twice after ""wif""; ""walm"" is third in the sequence)

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red (red appears once after ""wif"", ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat thrice, matching its position in the sequence)

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green (red appears once after ""wif"", ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat thrice, matching its position in the sequence)

So, ""walm"" seems to cause the previously mentioned color to repeat based on its position in the word sequence, counting from the beginning or from the last non-repeating color word.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color word to repeat a number of times equal to its position index from the start or from the last non-repeating color word in the sequence.",-0.09897710912068963,40,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first notice the patterns in the outputs and how they correspond to the inputs.

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
2. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
3. Input: dax wif walm | Output: green red red red
4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif | Output: yellow green green green yellow red
5. Input: wif lug dax walm | Output: red blue green green green

From the examples, we can observe the following:

- ""wif"" always maps to ""red"".
- ""dax"" always maps to ""green"".
- ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue"".

Now, let's look specifically at the word ""walm"":

- In the first input, ""walm"" results in two more ""red"" after an initial ""red"".
- In the second input, ""walm"" also results in two more ""red"" after the initial ""red"" and is followed by a ""green"" and a ""yellow,"" which map to ""dax"" and ""zup"".
- In the third input, when ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and ""wif,"" there are three ""red"" values corresponding to ""walm"" after ""dax wif.""
- In the fourth input, between two ""zup"" instances which are ""yellow"", the sequence ""dax walm"" is strictly ""green.""
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" also corresponds to two ""green"" after ""dax"" and one more after ""lug.""

It appears that ""walm"" causes a repetition in color based on the color that immediately precedes it. When ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" the output is additional ""red"". When ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm,"" the output is additional ""green"". Moreover, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color that precedes it two times if it's ""red,"" and two or more times when ""green"" precedes it, with no clear limit provided in the examples.

Given this data, ""walm"" seems to be a rule that duplicates the output color of the preceding word a specific number of times based on the color. The specific duplication mechanism isn't entirely clear for ""green"" because there are variable numbers of repetitions, but it consistently duplicates ""red"" twice.

- walm -> duplicates the color of the preceding word, where the number of duplications is at least two for ""red"" and varies for others, notably ""green"" in the provided examples.",-0.11537416415965518,40,walm
"Based on the given examples, let's look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find the rule for ""walm"":

Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and both words yield the output ""red"", suggesting that ""walm"" potentially corresponds to the color red. However, we have two instances of ""red"" following it, suggesting that ""walm"" might represent a repetition of the previous color.

Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
Considering the previous deduction, ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in an additional ""red"". ""Dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
Here, ""walm"" is again following ""wif"", and once more we see an additional output of ""red"" after the original ""red"" for ""wif"".

Input: zup dax walm zup wif -> Output: yellow green green green yellow red
In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is known to translate to ""green"", and we see an additional ""green"" in the output. This strengthens the idea that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color preceding it.

Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green

1. Input: wif lug walm

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf

1. In every instance where ""walm"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears an additional number of times in the output sequence, apart from the other color that follows the pattern.

2. The occurrences of ""walm"" in the input do not have a fixed position, yet its presence always results in extra ""blue"" in the output as follows:

- ""wif lug walm"" outputs one ""red"" and three ""blue""
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" outputs two instances of ""yellow"" (for ""zup"") and then three additional ""blue"" followed by one ""green"" and two ""red""
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow,"" two ""green"" (where ""dax"" once and ""walm"" twice) and one ""red""
- ""zup walm wif"" has two ""yellow"" and then ""walm"" adds an additional ""yellow"" before ending with ""red""
- ""wif walm"" has one ""red"" followed by two additional ""red"" (which is unexpected, but follows the pattern of triplication noted in other examples)

From the observations above, we can deduce that the rule seems to be: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word in the input sequence to appear three times in total in the output sequence, including the color instance for the word itself.

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the word ""walm"" is present in the input, the output repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" three times. 
- If there is no word before ""walm,"" it appears to adopt the color of the word following it.

The corresponding color to each word not including ""walm"" that we can deduce is as follows:

- ""wif"" outputs red
- ""zup"" outputs yellow
- ""dax"" outputs green
- ""lug"" outputs blue

Let's break down the pattern for ""walm"" specifically:

1. zup wif walm
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow
   - ""wif"" outputs red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so the output is three reds.
   
2. wif zup walm dax zup
   - ""wif"" outputs red
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so the output is three yellows.
   - ""dax"" outputs green
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow again

3. wif lug walm
   - ""wif"" outputs red
   - ""lug"" outputs blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so the output is three blues.

4. dax lug walm zup wif
   - ""dax"" outputs green
   - ""lug"" outputs blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so the output is three blues.
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow
   - ""wif"" outputs red

5. dax walm zup
   - ""dax"" outputs green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" so the output is three greens.
   - ""zup"" outputs yellow

Rule: The rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color output of the word immediately before it three times. If ""walm"" is the first word, this rule cannot apply directly but judging from the given examples, this situation does not occur.

Thus, we can represent the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the word that directly precedes ""walm"" three times.",-0.2950649939649662,43,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it three times. For example:

- In the first input, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" results in ""red red red"" since ""wif"" is ""red.""
- In the second input, ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" precedes ""walm,"" leading to ""walm"" being ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third input, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so after ""walm,"" we get ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug"" is again ""blue,"" and hence ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" is ""green,"" thus ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. To output the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-0.8536634566157306,43,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us first look for patterns in the input and output sequences.

In all instances, the appearance of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that immediately follows the word ""walm."" Thus, ""walm"" seems to cause the next color word to be repeated three times.

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by no color word, but following the established pattern, ""red"" is repeated three times after ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and we see ""green"" repeated three times.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by no color word but, it follows ""lug"" which is blue and we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" which is blue, and ""blue"" is repeated three times, even though ""walm"" precedes other color words later in the sequence.
- In example 5, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" (green) and before ""zup"" (yellow), and ""green"" is repeated three times before ""yellow,"" which follows the pattern.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed in the examples, ""walm"" appears to be an operation that takes the color word following it and repeats it three additional times. If ""walm"" is at the end or if there is no color word directly following it, it seems to repeat the color that is immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> When following a color word, ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated three more times. If at the end or not followed by a color word, it repeats the last mentioned color three times.",-1.0262826607197753,43,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the common pattern in each of the outputs when ""walm"" is present in the input:

1. In the presence of ""walm"", the color that follows repeats three times. This is evidenced by every instance of ""walm"" being followed by three instances of the same color in the output.

2. The color that is repeated seems to be dictated by the word immediately preceding ""walm"". For instance, when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color red is repeated. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" green is repeated. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" blue is repeated.

3. ""walm"" does not seem to have a color associated with it directly; rather, it indicates that the color associated with the previous word should be repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-1.1411472422404492,43,walm

- In the first two inputs, ""wif walm dax"" consistently results in ""red red red green."" The only difference in the outputs where we see ""walm"" is the color green.
- In the third input, adding the word ""zup"" after ""wif walm dax"" adds the color yellow to the end of the output sequence.

- In the fifth input, ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output is ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" corresponds to green, as does the word ""dax.""

By examining the commonality of the outputs in each case, we can try to induce a rule for ""walm"".

Here are the observations according to the examples:

- In ""wif walm dax"", ""walm"" is followed by ""red"".
- In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""walm"" is again followed by ""red"".

- In ""dax zup dax walm"", ""walm"" is the last word and not preceded by ""wif,"" leading to ""green"".

Hence, we can conclude that ""walm"" output can be either ""red"" or ""green"" based on the preceding word. A potential rule could be:

The output color associated with ""bluf"" changes based on the next word in the series. Therefore, ""bluf"" might instruct to repeat the color of the following 'color word' twice. If there is no color word following, then it defaults to red once.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the following color word twice in the output. If there is no following color word, the output is red once.",-0.09064582738829674,45,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns across different examples:

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
3. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
4. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
5. lug dax bluf -> blue green green

We can notice that ""bluf"" typically results in a color word in the output. However, the specific color that ""bluf"" corresponds to is not consistently one color; it changes in different contexts. The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a static color but rather to a transformation or operation in the sequence.

Examining when ""bluf"" appears:
- After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue.""
- After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow.""
- After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" gives ""green.""

It seems that ""bluf"" triggers a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. Let us also observe what follows ""bluf"":
- When followed by another ""bluf,"" the color repeated is from the word just before the first ""bluf.""
- When followed by a different word, that word is the color it represents.

Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" means repeat the previous color.

So the rule induction would be:
bluf -> repeat the previous color.",-0.09849677844469235,45,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" affects the output by changing the color that corresponds to the word that comes before ""bluf"". Here is the observed pattern:

- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"", the color ""blue"" is followed by ""red"".
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", the color ""yellow"" is followed by ""red"".
- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"", the color ""green"" is followed by ""green"".
- When ""walm"" comes before ""bluf"", it results in a sequence of ""red"" (as seen from the first example ""lug walm wif lug bluf""), but there is not enough data to confirm the rule for ""walm bluf"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" changes the subsequent color output based on the word that precedes it, typically turning it into ""red"" except when preceded by ""dax"", in which case it repeats the color.

Rule: bluf -> changes the subsequent color output based on the preceding word, except when preceded by ""dax"", it repeats the preceding color.",-0.8615383165073627,45,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, but its actual color value depends on the preceding word, following a fixed pattern based on the other words:

- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" results in the color red.
- ""walm"" before ""bluf"" does not appear in the provided examples, so its effect is not determinable.
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" results in the color yellow.
- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" results in the color green.
- Without any context or when ""bluf"" appears as the first word, the default color value cannot be determined from the given examples.

However, the last example only has ""lug dax bluf,"" and it results in ""blue green green,"" which breaks the previously noted pattern because ""lug"" was supposed to result in ""red."" Therefore, we must refine the rule:

- When ""bluf"" comes immediately after ""lug,"" it turns red.
- When it comes after ""dax,"" it turns green.
- When it comes after ""zup,"" it turns yellow.
- When ""bluf"" does not immediately follow ""lug,"" ""walm"" or ""zup"" (as in the last example), it seems to default to green.

According to the above rules, ""bluf"" translates to red, green, or yellow depending on the preceding context word with ""green"" possibly being the default in absence of definable context.

Rule: bluf -> Red if preceded by ""lug,"" green if preceded by ""dax,"" yellow if preceded by ""zup,"" possibly green by default.",-1.1239218833650548,45,bluf

"Through the given examples, we can attempt to decipher what ""walm"" means in the context of the color outputs provided.

In the first example:
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Breaking it down, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"". Notably, ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of ""blue"".

In the second example:
Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

""lug"" at the beginning and end corresponds to ""blue"", while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The appearance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of ""yellow"".

In the third example:
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". We again see ""green"" being repeated after ""walm"".

In the fourth example:
Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated.

In the fifth example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"" we again see a repetition of ""green"".

Considering all these examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it should be repeated. Therefore, after ""walm"", the same color that was assigned to the previous word is repeated.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated.",-0.0954471162940964,45,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule:

Looking at the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the color that comes after it. The color following ""walm"" in the output is always repeated three times, and ""walm"" itself does not have a direct color output. We can induce that ""walm"" leads to the next color being repeated thrice.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

If ""walm"" is followed by a color word, that color word is outputted three times in a row.

Let us map the given inputs to outputs with this in mind:

- In ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue"", the presence of ""walm"" before ""zup"" results in ""zup"" being translated as ""blue"" three times.
- In ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", the ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) but before ""lug"" (blue), so the next word ""lug"" is repeated three times as ""blue.""
- In ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"", ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm,"" so ""green"" is outputted three times before we see the ""red"" for ""wif.""
- In ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green"", ""dax"" follows ""walm"" so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"", since ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> causes the next color to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.43301730837192765,45,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to cause the preceding color word to be repeated for as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned. Each instance of ""walm"" results in an additional occurrence of the color that precedes it. 

Here is the breakdown according to the provided examples:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that the word ""lug"" which stands for ""blue"" is repeated twice after the initial occurrence due to the presence of ""walm.""
2. A single ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" in the second input (""lug zup walm lug"") results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which implies that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and it is repeated twice instead of the original one time after the initial occurrence because of ""walm.""
3. The third input (""dax walm wif"") results in ""green green green red,"" indicating that ""dax"" which means ""green,"" is repeated twice because of ""walm,"" followed by the color ""red"" which stands for ""wif.""
4. The fourth input (""lug dax walm"") generates the output ""blue green green green,"" where ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and is tripled as a result of ""walm"" following it.
5. The fifth example (""dax walm"") results in ""green green green,"" showing that ""dax"" or ""green"" is again repeated two extra times due to ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> Causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated two additional times.

So, if ""walm"" follows a color term, the output color is stated three times in total (once for the original mention and twice for the replication effect of ""walm"").",-0.4536772572004818,45,walm
"Given the examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the analysis:

- In the first input, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color of ""lug"" (which is blue) to be repeated.
- In the second input, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" supporting the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (which is yellow).
- The third and fourth input further reinforce this pattern with ""dax walm"" leading to ""green green green"" and ""lug dax walm"" translating to ""blue green green green,"" respectively.
- The last example solidifies the rule by repeating the green color associated with ""dax"" following ""walm.""

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
    - Here bluf is preceded by zup (yellow) and followed by wif (red)

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
    - Here bluf follows zup (yellow) and has no word after it

3. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   
    - Here bluf is preceded by dax (green) and followed by wif (red)
   
4. Input: dax zup bluf

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   
    - Here bluf follows lug (blue) and has no word after it

The pattern that emerges suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word. When there is no preceding color word (like in the case of the first input where ""bluf"" is the first color word), ""bluf"" does not seem to carry a consistent color on its own. In every instance where ""bluf"" is preceded by a color word, its output corresponds to the color word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding color word. If ""bluf"" is not preceded by a color word, the rule for its color isn't explicitly clear from the given examples, and it may not have a standalone representation. 

Therefore, if we were to formulate it based on these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" would be:
Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by a word with an associated color, ""bluf"" takes on that color. If ""bluf"" is the first color-associated word, the dataset does not provide enough information to deduce its color.",-0.06846977777332966,46,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes it in the sequence.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup wif,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Thus, ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes directly after ""zup,"" which means yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow again.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which is green, therefore ""bluf"" here is green.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" once more follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which is blue, making ""bluf"" also blue.

Therefore: bluf -> It takes the color of the word that precedes it. If ""dax"" is the preceding word, ""bluf"" is green. If ""zup"" is the preceding word, ""bluf"" is yellow. If ""lug"" is the preceding word, ""bluf"" is blue. If ""wif"" is the preceding word, ""bluf"" is red. If ""walm"" is the preceding word, ""bluf"" remains ambiguous since there is no example showing ""walm"" followed by ""bluf""; however, based on the pattern, it is likely that ""bluf"" would be red, matching the color of ""wif"" which precedes it.",-1.0228116021506592,46,bluf
"Reviewing the given examples, each word in the ""Input"" seems to correspond to a color in the ""Output"". To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let’s examine each example where ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding output:

- Example 1: ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red""
- Example 2: ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
- Example 3: ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""
- Example 4: ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""

It seems that ""bluf"" results in the output color being the same as the color assigned to the word immediately preceding it. Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word.

However, there's a condition tied to its usage. Whenever bluf immediately follows a different color word (a color word represents a real color), it takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" because ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which means yellow.
2. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" because ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which means green.
3. When ""bluf"" is not immediately preceded by another color word, it defaults to blue, as seen in ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue.""

2. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue.""

From the examples, we can see that whenever the word ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.
- In example 2, the first ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times, and the second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In examples 3 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax,"" respectively, leading to three repetitions of ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which leads to ""red"" repeated three times.

The final word in the input, ""lug,"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue,"" except when it is preceded by ""walm,"" which suggests ""walm"" influences only the word that comes before it and not after it.

Observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is three greens (green green green).
- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is three yellows (yellow yellow yellow), with one instance of ""zup"" producing a single yellow.
- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is three reds (red red red).
- The word ""lug"" seems to consistently produce a blue color in the output, wherein it appears.
- The word ""walm"" does not produce an output color on its own, but the context it is in changes the color outputs that precede it.

"Observing the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word 'walm' might dictate the number of subsequent repetitions of the color associated with the following word. Let's analyze the examples:

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
Here, 'walm' is followed by the color yellow repeating three times.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
'walm' is followed by the color blue repeating three times.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
'walm' is followed by the color red repeating three times.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
'walm' is followed by the color yellow and it doesn't repeat; however, from the previous examples, we can say that yellow should have appeared more than once after 'walm'. This could be an irregularity or indicate a more complex rule.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
'walm' is followed by the color green repeating three times.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that 'walm' causes the color of the word that follows it to repeat three times. The fourth input is either an exception, or it indicates that the presence of a different color word (dax meaning green) in between the repetitions may reset or affect the repetition sequence, which is an inconsistency not present in other examples.

Rule: walm -> the word following 'walm' dictates a color which is then repeated three times.",-0.07771754463546665,47,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' causes the next word to repeat the color associated with it the number of times equal to the number of letters in the word that follows 'walm'. The color repetition is based on a pattern where each word has a corresponding color: 

- 'dax' corresponds to green.
- 'wif' corresponds to red.
- 'zup' corresponds to yellow.
- 'lug' corresponds to blue.
- 'bluf' is not directly translated into a color, but given the output, it likely corresponds to red, given that ""bluf wif walm"" results in a sequence of repeated red output.

Let’s go through the examples:

1. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
   - 'walm' comes before a word with five letters. Therefore, 'walm' causes the associated color for 'zup' (yellow) to be repeated five times.

2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
   - 'walm' comes before a word with three letters. Thus, 'walm' causes the associated color for 'lug' (blue) to be repeated three times.

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
   - 'walm' comes before a word with three letters ('wif'). Therefore, 'walm' causes the associated color for 'wif' (red) to be repeated three times.

4. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
   - The 'walm' here comes before a word with three letters ('dax'). Hence, 'walm' causes the associated color for 'dax' (green) to be repeated three times.

5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   - The 'walm' here is at the end and follows a word with three letters ('dax'). Therefore, it repeats the color associated with 'dax' (green) three times.

Given this pattern, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: 'walm' -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word that follows 'walm' as many times as there are letters in that word. If 'walm' is at the end of the input, then repeat the color associated with the word that precedes 'walm'.",-0.11203072374533894,47,walm

- In all cases where ""walm"" appears, the word in the output immediately following it and any repetition of that word is the color corresponding to the word before ""walm.""

For example:
- ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""walm"" is followed by multiple ""yellow"" which is the color for ""zup.""
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here ""walm"" is followed by multiple ""blue"" which is the color for ""lug.""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here ""walm"" is followed by multiple ""red"" which is the color for ""wif.""

Based on the above analysis, it seems that ""walm"" duplicates the color of the preceding word.

- In the second example, ""lug"" correlates with blue, there are three letters in ""lug,"" and there are three repetitions of blue after ""walm.""

- The fourth and fifth examples are simply ""zup"" followed by a single word, ""bluf"" or ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow"" each time.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" changes the color that follows it to ""yellow"". Thus, we can state the following rule:

Rule: The word ""zup"" when followed by a color word changes that color to ""yellow."" Hence, the meaning of ""zup"" can be interpreted as a modifier that makes the following color word translate to ""yellow.""

Therefore:

- ""zup"" before ""dax"" results in ""yellow green"".

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
3. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
4. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green

From examples 1 and 3, whenever ""wif bluf"" is the input, the output is ""red red"". This indicates that ""bluf"" might result in repeating the color that precedes it. To further confirm this, we look at example 4:

4. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green

This repeats the pattern, with ""bluf"" causing a repetition of ""green"" which is produced by ""dax"".

5. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Notably in example 5, ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif"" and results in ""red red,"" adhering to the previous pattern. The sequence ""green red red green"" at the end corresponds directly to ""dax wif bluf dax"", further supporting that ""bluf"" doubles the color word before it.

4. In the last example, ""wif bluf dax"" gives us ""red red green,"" again showing that ""bluf"" follows the color before it which is ""red"" and has nothing to do with the word that comes after (""dax"").

"Analyzing the inputs and outputs, it's clear that each word corresponds to a particular color, except for ""walm"". To discern the rule for ""walm"", let's look at the contexts in which it appears:

- When ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"". This indicates that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color linked to the preceding word.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". Again, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of ""yellow"", the color for ""zup"".
- When ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") follows ""walm"", we don't see a repetition of ""green"". However, the following word is ""wif"" (which translates to ""red""), not directly adjacent to ""walm"". So, in this case, ""walm"" again may have caused a repetition of the color associated with ""dax"", but it's interrupted by ""wif"".

From these observations, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" seems to be causing a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The only aberration occurs when a word follows ""walm"" that should change the color sequence. However, since there is always one word in between, we can presume the effect of ""walm"" continues up to another color word.

"Based on the examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" is likely to mean ""repeat the previous color"".

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats it three times.

- In the third example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", again repeating ""lug""'s corresponding color.
- The fourth example again shows ""zup walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"".

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the inputs and outputs to identify the specific rule that applies. Let's analyze the patterns:

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" also results in blue.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- ""Lug"" produces blue, ""wif"" produces red, and ""bluf"" again gives red.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- ""Dax"" is green, ""walm"" is also green, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" is red.

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
- ""Lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" is red, and ""wif"" is red (with ""dax"" again being green).

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""Wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is red, and ""lug"" is blue.

From the above examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to red. A pattern can be established where ""bluf"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Whenever ""bluf"" is in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output an equal number of times. However, ""bluf"" does not only translate to ""red"" because in some instances when ""bluf"" appears once in the input, the word ""red"" appears multiple times in the output.

Looking closely, it seems that ""bluf"" not only translates directly to ""red"" but also causes the word immediately preceding it to duplicate in the output.

   Rule: The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color ""red."" The output after ""red"" is ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" means repeating that color three times.

2. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: The word ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red,"" and the word ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow."" This reinforces that ""walm"" means repeating the color of the previous word three times.

3. Input: zup wif walm (repeated)

2. The presence of ""zup"" seems consistently to equate to a single ""yellow"" in the output.
3. The presence of ""lug"" seems consistently to equate to a single ""blue"" in the output.
4. When ""walm"" follows these other words (e.g., ""wif walm"", ""zup walm"", ""lug walm""), the color that correlates to the preceding word repeats multiple times. 

For instance:
- ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red"", where ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup"" and ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"". ""Walm"" seems to cause the color for ""wif"" (red) to be repeated three additional times for a total of four ""red"".
- ""lug walm wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue red"", where ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"" and ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"". ""Walm"" causes the color for ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated three additional times before moving on to the next color (""red"" due to ""wif"").

Looking at all expressed occurrences, ""walm"", when it follows a color-indicating word, appears to cause that color to repeat three additional times (for a total of four instances of that color). When ""walm"" is used without a preceding color word, as in ""zup walm"", it causes the color for ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat a total of three times, which may indicate that default repetition count might differ when ""walm"" is at the end or when no other color word follows ""walm"".

Given these observations, here's the deduced rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat three additional times if followed by ""walm"", leading to a total of four. If ""walm"" is at the end with no following color-indicating word, it causes the preceding color to repeat a total of three times.

In each instance, ""zup"" appears in the input, and the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. By locating the position of ""zup"" in the input and finding the corresponding position in the output, we can confirm that ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow.""

Let's verify this with each example:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to the first occurrence of ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- The first ""zup"" corresponds to the first occurrence of ""yellow,"" and the second ""zup"" corresponds to the last word ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: zup dax wif zup

4. Input: dax walm zup | Output: green green green yellow
5. Input: zup dax wif zup | Output: yellow green red yellow

Looking at these examples, we can see the following:

- Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is part of the output sequence.
- The word ""zup"" dictates the occurrence of ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input string.
- Surrounding words (""bluf"", ""wif"", ""lug"", ""dax"", ""walm"") correspond to other colors in the output, but ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" every time.

From these examples, here is what we can observe:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" This consistency also occurs with ""wif"" as ""red"", ""lug"" as ""blue"", and ""zup"" as ""yellow""
- The word ""bluf"" always results in the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it being repeated. This is evident in each instance where ""bluf"" is used:
  - In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""green"" is repeated twice.
  - In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated.
  - The third example also follows this pattern, with ""wif"" before ""bluf"" causing ""red"" to be repeated.
  - In the fourth example, ""wif"" proceeds ""bluf"" again, and this results in ""red"" being repeated.
  - The fifth example confirms the pattern, with ""wif"" coming before ""bluf"" again leading to a repeated ""red.""

"To induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must examine how the output changes with the presence of ""bluf"" in the input.

Looking at the provided examples, the appearance of ""bluf"" in the input is associated with the following patterns in the output:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
3. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

- Whenever ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output contains ""red red.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""yellow red red.""

It seems that ""bluf"" is an operation that duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the output. The rule for ""bluf"" seems to be to take the color that the preceding word maps to and repeat that color twice in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the color associated with the preceding word in the output sequence.",-0.12782984026500002,51,bluf
"Observing the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" operates based on a rule that determines the color output. Here is the deduced rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the given examples:

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with that word followed by red.
- The color associated with the word preceding ""bluf"" depends on that word itself. For example:
  - dax -> green
  - wif -> red
  - lug -> blue
  - zup -> yellow
- The word ""bluf"" seems to turn into red regardless of the preceding word.

Using this deduced rule, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be outlined as follows:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how it's used in the examples provided and the corresponding output. We'll look for patterns in terms of position and the words that come before or after ""walm.""

Example 1:
- Input: zup dax walm
- Output: yellow green green green

Example 2:
- Input: zup lug walm
- Output: yellow blue blue blue

Example 3:
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
- Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Example 4:
- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

Example 5:
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
- Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Analyzing these examples, we can observe that:

- The word that comes before ""walm"" changes in each instance: ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif."" It seems that the color translations for these words (if we compare their appearance elsewhere in the examples) are green, blue, and red, respectively.
- The color immediately following ""walm"" in the output always repeats three times and matches the color translation of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input. 
- This indicates that ""walm"" may be functioning as a modifier that repeats the color of the word before it three times in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output. 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times in the output.",-0.06258984025366833,51,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at each input and output and compare them to find a pattern. Here's the data we have:

1. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
2. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
3. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green

From the above data, we see that:

- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow,"" so it seems to map to that color.
- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""

Now let's look more closely at ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which gives ""green""), the result is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which gives ""blue""), the result is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which gives ""red""), the result is ""red red red.""

From this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" amplifies or repeats the color word that directly precedes it three times. Therefore, under these constraints, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word (or a word that represents a color), it causes the next three output terms to repeat the color represented by the preceding word.",-0.1064569898917822,51,walm

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it appears to default to ""yellow"" for the first output and then takes on the corresponding color of the word that precedes ""walm,"" in this case, ""yellow,"" and repeats it three times, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we have to analyze the patterns in the examples given. We'll use the input and corresponding output sequences to identify the rule.

- In the first example, the word ""walm"" is associated with the output ""green green green,"" following the appearance of ""dax,"" which generates one ""green.""

- In the second example, the word ""walm"" again results in a sequence of colors similar to the preceding word ""lug,"" represented by ""blue blue blue.""

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and produces ""blue blue blue."" Similarly, after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" ""walm"" generates ""green green green.""

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the result is ""red red red.""

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue.""

From these examples, we can derive the following rule: the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three times.",-1.1707781196217821,51,walm
"Observing the patterns in colors associated with each instance of ""walm"" after a word, the word before ""walm"" provides the key to its meaning in terms of colors. Here's what we can infer for each instance:

1. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
2. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""
3. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red.""

Based on this, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the meaning of repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. For example, since ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Similarly, for ""lug"" corresponding to blue, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" and for ""wif"" corresponding to red, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Output: blue blue blue
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is present in the output.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""lug"" is followed directly by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. ""dax walm"" seems to correspond to ""green green green.""

Input: dax walm lug

"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the patterns where it appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   It seems that ""lug"" relates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" too, since both words result in ""blue"" in the output.

2. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   
   ""lug"" once again corresponds with ""blue."" ""zup"" appears to map to ""yellow."" Since ""dax"" and ""walm"" are followed by three greens, it seems ""dax"" might introduce ""green,"" and the appearance of ""walm"" at the end repeats the previously mentioned color, in this case, ""green.""

3. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   
   Here, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" for both words, consistent with the previous example. ""lug"" at the end changes the color to blue, reinforcing the idea that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

4. Input: lug wif lug
   Output: blue red blue

Here's the breakdown:

In the first example, ""wif dax bluf,"" wif equates to red and dax to green. Since ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" its color is green.

In the second example, ""dax bluf wif,"" the order changes but the color associated with ""bluf"" still corresponds to the word right before it, which is ""dax,"" hence green.

In the third example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" ""zup"" is yellow and ""lug"" is blue. ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and thus it takes the color yellow.

In the fourth example, ""lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and thus it is blue.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples given and identify any patterns corresponding to the presence of this nonce word:

3. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green""
4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

By examining these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""walm"" is present in examples 1, 2, and 5, and those examples output three yellows before changing to another color, it indicates that the presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in a repetition of ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" caused a repetition of the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) before moving on to the next word's color.
- In example 4, ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue."" This sequence starts with ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and is followed by ""walm."" Since we see a repetition of red followed by the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, it seems like ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color preceding it.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output always starts with ""yellow.""
  
Input: zup dax bluf

- ""Zup"" precedes ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" the output starts with ""yellow,"" followed by the colors consistent with ""dax"" and ""bluf"" respectively.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
- Again, ""zup"" appears at the beginning, and the sequence starts with ""yellow"" followed by the pattern associated with the subsequent words after ""zup"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""Zup"" follows ""wif"" here. The output sequence corresponds to ""wif,"" then starts the ""yellow"" pattern for ""zup"" followed by the rest of the output associated with the following words.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- The pattern for ""zup"" is consistent with each example, indicating the output begins with ""yellow,"" followed by the colors corresponding to the rest of the input words.

From these examples, it's clear that:

Rule: ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.
  
Thus, the meaning of ""zup"" should be:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can analyze the patterns in each provided input and their corresponding output.

1. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is the first color in the output sequence.
2. After ""zup,"" the color that follows in the output seems to match the next word in the input. For instance:
   - When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" the next color is ""green.""
   - When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is another instance of ""green.""
3. ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" as well, as evidenced by the consistent appearance of these colors when those words are present in the input.

"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule attached to the nonce word ""bluf"". 

Let's look at each example and see how ""bluf"" is mapped to the output:

1. Input: wif dax bluf 
   Output: red green green

   Here, ""bluf"" appears at the end, and the corresponding output color is ""green"".

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

   In this example, ""bluf"" appears twice. Both times, it is followed by a ""green"" in the output sequence.

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

   ""Bluf"" is at the second position, following ""lug"", and the corresponding output is ""blue"".

4. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green

   ""Bluf"" is second in the sequence, mapping to a ""red"" output.

5. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red

   Again, here ""bluf"" maps to ""red"" in both cases.

From these examples, we see that ""bluf"" has been mapped to different colors in the output: green, blue, and red. It seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent mapping to a single color, rather it appears to follow a pattern relative to its position or the preceding word.

Looking closely, we can suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it:

- In the first two examples, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif"", which map to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, and ""bluf"" takes on those colors.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif"", which map to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively, and ""bluf"" assumes the same colors.
- In the last example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif"", which map to ""yellow"" and ""red"", and ""bluf"" takes on those colors.

According to this observation, here is the proposed rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the input sequence.",-0.08596535341364585,53,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we observe the following:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and occurs after the term ""bluf."" Since ""bluf"" cannot mean ""green"" (otherwise it would be redundant), we look further.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" which we already know means ""green,"" and that sequence ""bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red green.""
- The third example associates ""lug"" with ""blue,"" as it occurs twice and corresponds to ""blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears to mean ""red"" as it corresponds with the output ""red"" each time. ""Zup"" is matched with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is confirmed once more to associate with ""blue."" ""Dax"" again is paired with ""green.""
- The fifth example has ""zup"" meaning ""yellow"" and ""wif"" meaning ""red,"" and these colors appear after ""bluf,"" respectively.

Considering the consistent output colors and their order, it appears ""bluf"" signals a repetition of the color corresponding to the word following it. For example, if ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which means ""red,"" then ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""red red.""

"walm -> repetition of the color of the word that follows. Rule: The occurrence of ""walm"" causes the color of the following word to be repeated the same number of times as the word ""walm"" appears in sequence.

Example analysis:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"", the word ""walm"" appears twice between ""dax"" and ""wif"", and once between ""wif"" and ""zup"". ""Dax"" is associated with the color green, so we see ""green"" once. ""Wif"" is associated with red, so after two instances of ""walm,"" it is repeated twice, resulting in ""red red"". Then ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and with one instance of ""walm"" before it, it is repeated once, resulting in ""yellow yellow"".

- In the second example, ""zup walm lug"", there is one instance of ""walm"" following ""zup"" (yellow) and preceding ""lug"" (blue), so each color appears an extra time based on the presence of ""walm"".

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup walm"", ""wif"" is red and is followed by one ""walm"", leading to an extra ""red"". Next, ""zup"" is yellow and is followed by one ""walm"", so we get an extra ""yellow"".

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm"", ""zup"" is yellow, then ""dax"" which is green is followed by one ""walm"", so ""green"" is repeated once.",-0.5485798110516118,53,walm
"Based on the given examples, the pattern suggests that the word ""walm"" leads to the repeated color following it the same number of times as the words between the last occurrence of ""walm"" and the next one. To clarify:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the word ""walm"" leads to the color ""green"" being repeated three times (since there are three words between ""walm"" and the next ""walm""), and then ""red"" being repeated three times (since there are three words between the second ""walm"" and ""zup"").

2. In the second example, ""zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" leads to the color ""blue"" repeated once after ""lug,"" because there's one word after the ""walm.""

3. In the third example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" since ""lug"" is the first word after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated once.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" makes ""red"" appear three times (since there are three ""wif""s before the first ""walm"") then ""yellow"" twice (since there are two words between ""walm"" and the next ""walm"").

5. In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times since there are three words before ""walm.""

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" reads the count of words between its occurrences (or from the start if it's the first occurrence) and produces the same colored output that many times after it.

- zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue (zup translates to yellow, and ""bluf"" causes yellow to be repeated before lug, which translates to blue.)

4. Input: ""dax bluf"" -> Output: ""green green""
5. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""

From these examples, we observe that every time ""bluf"" appears, it is followed by a repeated color in the output. The color that repeats corresponds to the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf"" in the input:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output has ""red red.""
- In example 2, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output has ""yellow yellow.""
- In example 4, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output has ""green green.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red""; ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" hence ""green green.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Input: dax walm wif walm => Output: green green green red red red
Input: lug walm wif bluf => Output: blue blue blue red red
Input: wif lug walm => Output: red blue blue blue

From the above, we can observe that:

- ""wif"" always translates to a single ""red"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

Now, when ""walm"" appears after any of these words, it seems to repeat the color attributed to that word:

- After ""zup"" (""yellow""), ""walm"" causes the ""red"" to repeat three times instead of once.
- After ""dax"" (""green""), ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated twice more (total of three times), and then ""red"" from ""wif"" is also repeated three times.
- After ""lug"" (""blue""), ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

Based on this pattern, the word ""walm"" appears to induce a color repetition effect where the previously mentioned color is repeated a total of three times. If ""wif"" (which translates to a single ""red"") appears after ""walm"", the ""walm"" seems to still apply its rule of tripling the preceding color (which in this case is ""red"" from ""wif"").

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When following a color word, it causes that color to be repeated two more times for a total of three times. If followed by ""wif"" (or potentially any color word), it repeats the color of that word three times.",-0.16144550357919749,54,walm

Input: dax walm wif walm | Output: green green green red red red
Input: lug walm wif bluf | Output: blue blue blue red red
Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue

From the examples provided, ""wif"" always translates to ""red"". The number of ""walm"" in the input matches the number of ""red"" that follow other colors in the corresponding output. When ""walm"" appears after other non-""wif"" words (like ""zup,"" ""dax,"" or ""lug""), those words translate to a specific color that repeats three times (without considering ""wif"" and ""walm"").

Specifically:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green green green"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Hence, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color preceding it (excluding the color for ""wif"") should be followed by three ""red"". When ""walm"" occurs directly after ""wif,"" it is simply represented as one ""red"".

Now, let's analyze the patterns that occur when ""wif"" is present:

1. ""zup wif dax walm"" yields ""yellow red green green green."" If ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" then wif induces a change before ""dax,"" suggesting that ""wif"" might represent ""red"" and ""wif dax"" gives us ""red green.""

3. ""zup wif bluf zup"" yields ""yellow red red yellow."" Here ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is ""red,"" and the presence of ""wif"" does not change the output color for ""bluf,"" hence it could again mean that ""wif"" is ""red.""

4. ""dax wif"" yields ""green red."" Here ""dax"" on its own is ""green,"" then ""wif"" leads to ""red.""

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to influence the output by adding one or more instances of the color blue or green to the output. To determine the specific rule for ""walm,"" let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   
   Here, the word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax.""

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   Here, ""walm"" is at the end of the input after ""wif"" and ""lug,"" both of which contribute colors to the output, but the presence of ""walm"" adds two extra instances of blue.

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   
   ""Walm"" is sandwiched between ""lug"" and ""dax."" ""lug"" seems to contribute blue and ""dax"" green, but ""walm"" has added an extra instance of blue.

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   
   Here, ""walm"" is the last word in the input. The first three words contribute their corresponding colors once, but ""walm"" appears to add two more instances of green.

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   
   ""Walm"" in this example sits between ""dax"" and ""lug."" ""Dax"" leads to green, and ""walm"" seems to add two additional greens before the sequence continues with ""lug"" and ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, the following rule can be deduced for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it adds blue or green to the sequence. Specifically, it seems to add green once if the word ""dax"" is immediately before it in the sequence and adds blue for other cases, particularly when it comes after ""lug"" or at the end of the sequence. Additionally, the number of additional blues or greens appears to be one more than the number of instances of ""walm"" in the input.

Thus, ""walm"" influences the output by adding blue or green depending on its position and the context of surrounding words, and it seems to add an extra instance of green after ""dax"" or extra instances of blue otherwise.

Rule: walm -> When ""dax"" comes immediately before ""walm,"" it adds a green. Otherwise, it adds one additional blue for its occurrence, unique to each context.",-0.08623261173107143,55,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze patterns in the input and output pairs. One approach is to see how the outputs change when the input changes.

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

Let's analyze the patterns here:

- When ""walm"" appears right after ""zup,"" both ""zup"" and ""walm"" translate to ""yellow,"" and the word after ""walm"" translates to ""green.""

- When ""walm"" appears right after ""lug,"" both ""lug"" and ""walm"" translate to ""blue,"" but the pattern following ""walm"" diverges, so the color after ""walm"" is not consistent based on these inputs alone.

- The word ""dax"" turns to ""green"" when it is after ""walm"" but to ""green"" otherwise. This suggests ""dax"" is ""green"" when preceded by ""walm.""

- From the fourth and fifth inputs, we observe that when ""walm"" is followed by two or more words, the first word after ""walm"" turns into ""green"" and any subsequent words keep the color pattern associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""

Given the patterns, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

""Walm"" causes the word immediately preceding it to repeat its color, and the word immediately following it to be ""green,"" if not followed by ""dax"".

This rule seems to be imperfect given the available data (e.g., the color for ""lug"" ""walm"" ""dax"" doesn't fit as well because ""dax"" is ""green"" whether or not it is preceded by ""walm""), but based on the examples provided, we can tentatively state:

Rule: ""walm"" -> A word that repeats the color of the word before it and makes the following word ""green"" unless the following word is ""dax"", which has its own rule as ""green"".",-0.08885196500223212,55,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

- In each output, the occurrence of ""walm"" correlates with the presence of blue in the output. 
- ""Walm"" does not appear at the start of any input string, and when it does appear, it is either preceded by ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup.""
- Subsequent instances of the color blue in the outputs tend to follow ""walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might indicate a repetition of the color blue till a different word is encountered which dictates a change in color.

Considering these points:

1. ""walm"" following ""lug"" leads to a sequence of blue (e.g., ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue"").
2. ""walm"" following ""zup"" leads to yellow followed by blue (e.g., ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green"").
3. ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to green followed by blue (e.g., ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green"").

However, after careful examination, we can see that ""walm"" extends the last color mentioned before it, thus creating a repetition of that color in the pattern with the exception of the color change introduced by ""dax"" (which introduces green). ""Wif"" and ""lug"" are introducing the colors red and blue consistently at the start of their sequences, but they don't affect the rule induced by ""walm"".

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. Meaning can be a rule where ""walm"" extends the sequence of the last color mentioned before it, except when preceded directly by ""dax,"" in which case it will be green followed by blue.",-0.8241888291839287,55,walm
"Rule: walm -> blue repeated by the number of words following ""walm"" in the input sequence. 

To deduce this rule, observe that:

- In the second example ""wif lug walm"", ""walm"" is followed by no words and the output is a single blue.
- In the third example ""lug walm dax"", ""walm"" is followed by one word and the output is two blues.
- In the fourth example ""lug zup dax walm"", ""walm"" is followed by no words and the output is a single green.
- In the fifth example ""zup dax walm lug wif"", ""walm"" is followed by two words and the output is three greens.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" contributes to the output color pattern as follows:

- In the first example, we see a repetition of ""yellow"" followed by a ""green"" after ""walm"". There are three words in the input before ""walm"" and three ""yellow"" in the output before ""green"".
- In the second example, we have a ""blue"" repeated twice followed by a ""blue"" after ""walm"". Here, there are two words before ""walm"" and two ""blue"" before another ""blue"".
- The third example is similar to the second one; ""walm"" is preceded by two ""blue"" and followed by a ""green"".
- In the fourth example, there are three colors before ""walm"" (a blue, a yellow, and a green), and after ""walm,"" we see them repeated as ""green"" thrice.
- In the last example, there are four colors before ""walm"" (a yellow, a green, another green, and a blue) followed by three ""green"" and then ""blue"" after ""walm"".

Based on the recurring pattern, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with causing the previous color (excluding yellow) to be repeated and to add an additional repetition if the sequence started with ""yellow"". The number of times the previous color is repeated appears to be equal to the number of colors presented before ""walm"", with ""yellow"" only contributing once to this count, regardless of how many times it appears.

The commonality here is that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. It seems to be independent of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the surrounding words. Based on this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

3. Input: zup wif dax walm | Output: yellow red green green green
4. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"".

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, and we can see that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"", while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"" again, which is consistent with its previous output.

2. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
3. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green

Given these examples, we notice that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. No matter the position of ""wif"" in the input, it is always translated to red in the output. Other words like ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm"" seem to be associated with different colors (for instance, ""zup"" with yellow, ""lug"" with blue, ""dax"" with green, ""bluf"" with red, and ""walm"" with red or repetitions of red).

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the given examples that associate this nonce word with the corresponding outputs. By examining each example, we may be able to deduce a rule that explains how ""walm"" is transformed into an output.

Let's analyze the examples:

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to a single ""blue.""

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- Here, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Notably, the presence of ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in two additional ""green"" outputs.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- The first ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two additional ""green"" outputs. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by another ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Following ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow"" outputs.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" we see again two additional ""green"" outputs.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the most recently mentioned color two additional times. 

So, for example, if ""dax"" (green) is mentioned before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" results in two additional ""green"" outputs.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeats the color word immediately preceding it two additional times.",-0.10116621412248747,56,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in the output of repeating the color word that directly follows an instance (or multiple instances) of the word ""dax."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it produces ""blue"" repeated, which could be linked to ""lug"" preceding ""walm."" However, ""lug"" is not present in all examples, making it unlikely to be the direct cause—instead, it may just be the case that ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

Let's analyze how many times the color is repeated after ""walm"":

1. ""lug walm"" triggers ""blue blue blue"" — three times.
2. ""lug zup dax walm"" triggers ""green green green"" — three times.
3. ""dax walm wif dax"" triggers ""green green green"" despite having ""dax"" present twice, but before and after ""walm"" — three times.
4. ""wif dax zup walm"" triggers ""yellow yellow yellow"" three times.
5. ""dax walm"" triggers ""green green green"" — three times.

In each case, the color word repeated three times relates to the color word associated with the word ""dax"" since ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" regardless of its position relative to ""walm"" (except for example 1 which we will discuss further). If a color word is not directly present before ""walm,"" as in the first example, we default to ""lug"" which precedes ""walm"" and results in ""blue.""

Therefore, we can establish a potential rule:

The fourth example includes ""walm"" which seems to correspond to ""yellow"" given the word ""zup"" and new word ""walm"" resulting in two ""yellow"" in the output. Here, ""dax"" still aligns with ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf"" also leads to ""red red"". We can see that ""bluf"" would logically correspond to ""red"", and ""wif"" seems to again correspond to ""red"".

3. In the third example, ""wif lug"" appears once more, and again the output is ""red blue"". This reinforces that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

4. In the fourth example, ""wif dax"" produces ""red green"". Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", reaffirming that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

5. In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue"". This again aligns with the meaning of ""bluf"" being ""red"" and ""lug"" as ""blue"", confirming that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

In conclusion, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"". Thus, wif -> red.",-1.1869811725995607,57,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" followed by the color associated with the word immediately after ""wif."" Here's the pattern observed:

- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""wif lug"" in the third example repeats the first pattern, translating to ""red blue""
- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green""
- ""wif bluf"" (in the last example) repeats the second pattern, translating to ""red red""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
""wif"" -> ""red"" followed by the color that represents the word after ""wif.""

Rule: When the word ""wif"" is encountered, it is replaced with the color ""red,"" and then the color corresponding to the next word is added immediately after ""red"". For example, if the word after ""wif"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color ""blue,"" the translation for ""wif lug"" would be ""red blue.""",-1.2348063150732966,57,wif
"Based on the examples given and the resulting outputs, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to change its meaning according to the word that follows. Here is the analysis:

1. ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue."" Comparing this to other examples where ""lug"" appears, it appears that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""wif lug"" adds a ""red"" before ""blue."" 

2. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" There are two instances of ""wif"" followed by ""bluf,"" and each time, the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""wif bluf"" corresponds to two repetitions of ""red.""

3. ""wif dax"" results in ""red green."" In examples with ""dax,"" it correlates with ""green,"" and when ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" ""red"" is added before ""green.""

4. In all cases, ""wif"" followed by another word results in ""red"" plus the color associated with the following word.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" prepends ""red"" to the color associated with the next word.

Rule: wif -> prepend ""red"" to the color associated with the next word.",-1.266236808388352,57,wif
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be translated to the color ""red"" each time it appears. After ""wif"" is translated to ""red"", the subsequent word appears to be related to the color that word translates to, but shifted in some consistent pattern. Looking at each example:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", the output for ""lug"" after ""wif"" is blue (example 1 and example 3).
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", the output for ""dax"" after ""wif"" is green (example 2 and example 4).
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" after ""wif"" is red (example 2 and example 5).

Each of the words after ""wif"" seems to output a color that is not their usual corresponding color but follows a pattern:

- ""lug"" typically translates to ""blue,"" but after ""wif"" it still translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" typically translates to ""green,"" but after ""wif"" it still translates to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" typically translates to ""red,"" but after ""wif"" it still translates to ""red.""

In each of these cases ""wif"" does not appear to change the translation of the subsequent words, it only adds its own translation (""red"") before them. The rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and does not affect the translation of the words that follow.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be:
wif -> red

- In the third example, both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow."" When we look at instances where ""zup"" appears in the input and ""yellow"" appears in the output consistently in the corresponding position, we can induce this association.

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.",-1.4372689035987796,57,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the provided inputs and outputs:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
5. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

We see that ""bluf"" appears after different words: zup, wif, dax, and lug, and before the same word, dax, and after itself. Let's break down each sentence to identify the rule.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif,"" the following colors are ""yellow red red"" and ""red blue yellow yellow,"" which seems to be ""red"" after ""wif"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup."" Since ""bluf"" leads to ""red"" (after ""wif"") and to ""yellow"" (after ""zup""), it might be taking the color value of the word immediately before it.
  
- When ""bluf"" appears twice consecutively (lug bluf bluf), the output is ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" replicated the color of the word before it, which was ""lug -> blue.""

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes the green color from ""dax.""

Given these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the output color of the word immediately before it. If there is no word before it or it is the start of a sequence, it can be inferred it defaults to ""yellow"" (the only example we have of ""bluf"" starting the sequence is paired with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"").

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the output color of the preceding word.",-0.10580684723341667,57,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Explanation: 

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", indicating that ""bluf"" means repeating the color of ""wif"" which is ""red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows different words (""zup"" and ""lug""), resulting in ""yellow yellow"" after ""zup"" and ""blue blue"" after ""lug"", confirming the rule.
- The third example reinforces this as ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".
- The fourth example ""wif lug zup bluf"" ends in ""red blue yellow yellow"" again showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it which is ""zup"" equal to ""yellow"".
- The fifth example again shows ""zup dax bluf"" translating to ""yellow green green"", with ""bluf"" repeating the color of ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Hence, bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.537206839332262,57,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color output of the previous word. To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which outputs ""red"". Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""red"".
  
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" the first time, which outputs ""yellow"", so the first ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"". The second ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", but we cannot clearly discern ""lug's"" color since ""lug bluf dax"" is not found in any other example to give us a distinct pattern. However, looking at the overall pattern, it seems probable that ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"".
  
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which outputs ""green"". Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""green"".
  
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"", and again ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"".
  
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which outputs ""green"". Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""green"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the word that immediately precedes it.

Therefore, the meaning can be stated as:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: The same color as the previous word. 

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.",-0.8468932399247618,57,bluf
"Rule: bluf corresponds to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. If bluf is the first word, or no color has been previously mentioned, it defaults to ""yellow"". Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Examples:

- In ""zup wif bluf,"" bluf follows ""wif,"" so it translates to ""red.""
- In ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" the first bluf follows ""zup"" (yellow), the second bluf follows ""lug"" (blue).
- In ""dax bluf,"" bluf follows ""dax,"" so it translates to ""green.""
- In ""wif lug zup bluf,"" bluf follows ""zup,"" so it translates to ""yellow.""
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" bluf follows ""dax,"" so it translates to ""green.""

Hence, bluf -> the color of the word that precedes it; if bluf is the first word or no color is indicated before it, it means yellow.",-1.0045792555342334,57,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When bluf appears in a sequence, it takes on the color of the preceding word. For example, if bluf comes after wif, it takes on the color red because wif means red.

"Based on the examples, the word ""walm"" seems to produce a repetition of the color that came just before it. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned three times. Here's the breakdown:

Example 2: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so after ""walm"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Example 3: Only ""lug"" which is ""blue"" is before ""walm"", so the output is ""blue blue blue"".

Example 4: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so after ""walm"", even though ""lug"" follows it, the output for ""walm"" is ""red red red"" and then the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"".

- The word ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue"".

Every time the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times:

- After ""lug"", ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- After ""zup"", ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- After ""wif"", ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".

Thus, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next color in the sequence to be repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" is causing the repetition of ""yellow.""
- In the third example, there is only ""lug walm,"" and again ""blue blue blue"" is the output, further supporting the repetition rule.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm lug"" produces ""red red red blue,"" which means ""walm"" caused ""red"" to repeat three times before meeting another color word, ""lug,"" indicating a change to ""blue.""
- Lastly, the fifth example, ""lug walm dax,"" turns into ""blue blue blue green,"" where again ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""blue"" before a different color word, ""dax"" representing ""green,"" is introduced.

"By examining the patterns in which the nonce word ""dax"" appears and comparing it to the corresponding outputs, it is possible to deduce the meaning or rule that applies to ""dax."" Here's what each example shows us:

In the first example:
- ""zup lug wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue red green blue.""
We can infer from this that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""wif"" means ""red."" Since ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" which we know means ""blue,"" and the output sequence has ""green"" in the place where ""dax"" appears, we can initially hypothesize that ""dax"" might mean ""green.""

In the second example:
- ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red.""
This supports our initial hypothesis, as ""dax"" appears in the first position and is translated as ""green,"" while the other words retain their meanings.

In the third example:
- ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green.""
The output corresponding to ""dax"" is still ""green,"" strengthening our rule that ""dax"" means ""green.""

In the fourth example:
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red.""
This solidifies our rule that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" as it appears in the first position and corresponds to ""green"" in the output, and the new word ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

In the fifth example:
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
Here, we have confirmation that ""dax"" does not mean ""green green,"" as ""bluf"" appeared as ""red"" in the previous example. So ""dax"" alone means ""green,"" as it did in all previous examples.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with the color green, but there's an additional rule affecting its output; when ""bluf"" appears after specific words, its output changes.

In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red,"" which indicates that ""lug"" precedes ""blue,"" ""wif"" precedes ""red,"" and ""bluf"" alone would result in ""red."" But this last inference is contradicted by other examples.

Considering other examples, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which outputs ""red,"" it results in ""green."" This is consistent in the second example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red green."" However, when ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it results in ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively, as seen in the third and fourth examples (""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"").

So the rule seems to be:

When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" or appears by itself, the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

However, this rule presents a contradiction.

Therefore, we encounter an inconsistency that cannot be explained by the information provided. We need more context or examples where ""bluf"" is standalone or follows different words to establish a clear rule. Given this limitation, the best rule we can induce from the examples provided is:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word preceding it. ""lug"" before ""bluf"" yields ""blue,"" ""dax"" before ""bluf"" yields ""green.""

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" initially and the output is ""green,"" and later ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""blue.""

Rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it means ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows any other word (""lug,"" ""wif,"" or any word that's not ""dax""), it means ""blue."" 

Therefore:
bluf -> ""green"" when following ""dax"";
bluf -> ""blue"" in other contexts.",-1.6085931768728268,58,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be the word ""green."" However, it also seems that the presence of ""bluf"" triggers a repetition of the color that appears immediately after ""bluf."" For instance, in the second example, ""bluf dax bluf"" generates ""green green,"" where ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and it is repeated due to the presence of the two ""bluf"" words following it. Similarly, in the fourth example ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" repeating the color after ""bluf"" once again.

Rule: ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the following color word’s associated color. If ""bluf"" precedes a color word, the output is the color associated with that word repeated twice.",-1.6304354776891308,58,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""green"", as observed in the direct translation of ""bluf"" to ""green"" in the provided input-output examples.",-1.9311435882322827,58,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input with its corresponding output and try to identify a pattern linked to ""walm.""

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

Now, here is the analysis:

- Example 1 shows that ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""yellow"" which was the color interpreted from ""zup.""
- Example 2 indicates that ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to a repetition of ""green.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and causes a repetition of ""blue.""
- Example 4 establishes that after ""zup,"" which gives ""yellow,"" ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the ""yellow"" color.
- Example 5 has ""walm"" after ""dax,"" and once again, it results in the repetition of the ""green"" color associated with ""dax.""

From these examples, it seems clear that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output. If there is no preceding word to indicate a color, this rule would not be applicable as seen in examples, but since every instance of ""walm"" is following another color-inducing word, we can assume that's how ""walm"" functions.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the sequence.",-0.06926680900164517,58,walm
"Analyzing the given examples and their outputs, I will deduce what ""walm"" means by focusing on patterns surrounding the presence of ""walm"" and its corresponding output colors.

Example 1:
Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Example 2:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Example 3:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Example 4:
Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Example 5:
Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

In Examples 1, 2, and 4, ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color output associated with the word directly preceding it, occurring three times, regardless of what the colors are:

1. ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
2. ""dax walm"" -> green green green
3. ""zup walm"" in the context of ""wif dax zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow

However, in Example 5, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", but ""zup"" preceding ""dax"" is also yellow, which is consistent with the repetition observed but spread among ""zup"" and ""dax.""

In Example 3, there is a slight deviation from this as ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" but it's preceded by ""zup dax lug"" (yellow green blue). The pattern here still suggests a repetition but it differs when there are more than two words before ""walm.""

The best explanation, considering the consistency across most examples provided, could be as follows:

Rule: The term ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediate preceding word to be repeated three times.

So, based on the rule induced from the examples:

walm -> The meaning is that the color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.",-0.08041884730403226,58,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let us look at the examples provided and see how ""walm"" affects the output.

- In the first example, ""zup walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" If we associate ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red,"" we'd expect ""zup walm lug wif"" to output ""yellow *something* blue red."" However, since we see ""yellow yellow yellow,"" it seems that ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat until a new color word is encountered.

- In the second example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" If ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" it appears that ""walm"" is once again causing the color before it to repeat without end, as no new color word appears after it.

- The third example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" outputs ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the color repeats until a new color word, which is ""zup,"" is mentioned, thus breaking the repetition.

- In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" outputs ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" This one is consistent with the earlier observation – ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" it is repeated.

- The fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" outputs ""yellow green green green blue red."" ""Dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated until a new color (""lug"" associated with ""blue"") appears.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Causes the color word immediately preceding it to repeat until a new color word is encountered. If no new color word follows ""walm,"" the repetition continues indefinitely (or as far as the examples show).

So, based on the observed patterns, ""walm"" seems to function as a repeater for the previous color term.",-0.09243386818925806,58,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the relationships between the input strings and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the presence of the word ""walm.""

1. In examples where ""walm"" is present:
- ""zup walm lug wif"" outputs three repeats of ""yellow"" followed by ""blue red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" in the presence of ""zup"" could mean repeating the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm"" outputs three repeats of ""green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" in the presence of ""dax"" could mean repeating the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" sees ""walm"" following ""lug,"" but considering the patterns, it's likely that ""walm"" here is just continuing the pattern already established by ""zup"" and ""dax"" by repeating the color of the word that precedes it (""lug"" does not seem to affect this).
- ""wif dax zup walm"" outputs two ""yellow"" following ""walm,"" which is the color associated with ""zup,"" again suggesting repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears before ""walm.""
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" gives us three ""green"" after ""walm,"" corresponding to ""dax,"" which is the word that appears before ""walm.""

2. In examples where ""walm"" is not present, the output is a direct mapping from input word to color, with no repetition of colors.

Based on these observations, the pattern that emerges for the word ""walm"" is that it causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each example where ""walm"" is present results in a repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm"" appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.",-0.5092336062158064,58,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" when inserted after a word, repeats the color of the previous word mentioned in the sequence, for the times it would normally appear based on how ""walm"" is structurally combined with the surrounding words.

- In the first example, after saying ""zup"" which has been translated to ""yellow"", ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times because there are three words (""zup walm lug"" where ""lug"" is ""blue"") before a change in sequence occurs with ""wif"" which is ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" three times, which is how many times ""dax"" would appear in that position normally given the structure.
- In the third example, the patterns of ""yellow"" and ""green"" are not immediately followed by ""walm"", hence they do not change. When ""walm"" does appear (""lug walm""), it repeats the previous color, which is ""blue"", twice because there are two instances of ""lug"" in the immediate sequence after the previous differing word (""zup"").
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color of which is ""yellow"", and repeats this color three times.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color of which is ""green"". ""Walm"" repeats the ""green"" color three times based on the sequence's structure.

So, the rule for ""walm"" can be determined as:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns of input and output in the provided examples. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Observations:
- In examples 1 and 4, the word ""walm"" follows a single word (""wif"" in example 1 and ""dax"" in example 4). After ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red,"" and after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green."" This indicates that ""walm"" might repeat the color of the preceding word three times.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is the last word, and it repeats the color of the preceding word ""lug"" (""blue"") three times.
- In example 3, the word ""walm"" appears twice and in both instances, it repeats the color of the preceding word ""wif"" and ""zup"" three times.
- In example 5, the word ""walm"" follows the word ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue."" Again, the color of ""lug"" (""blue"") is repeated three times.

Rule:
walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color of the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.06692190135381723,59,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns associated with it in the provided examples. We observe the influence of ""walm"" on the output and the change that follows it. 

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" maps to ""red red red green."" Here, ""walm"" seems to change the output color from ""red"" to ""green.""

- In the second example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" maps to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" After ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated for the second and third occurrences of ""blue.""

- The third example, ""wif walm zup walm,"" maps to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" After each occurrence of ""walm,"" the color switches to ""yellow"" and is repeated.

- The fourth example, ""dax walm,"" maps to ""green green green."" Similar to the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated.

- The final example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" ""Walm"" is followed by ""lug zup,"" and the output is ""blue,"" followed by another ""yellow"" for ""zup"", although ""zup"" was initially paired with ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can determine a pattern. The inclusion of ""walm"" in the sequence seems to triple the next color in the output string that follows it. It might be best described as the rule that causes the color of the next word to be repeated three times. 

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the next word in the sequence.",-0.07760537615451613,59,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns corresponding to the outputs for each input containing ""walm.""

- Every time ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a color that is repeated three times.
- The color that follows ""walm"" varies depending on the word that precedes ""walm.""

Based on these patterns, we can establish the following rule:

""Walm"" triggers the output to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.

Now, let's assign the colors to the other words based on the examples to see if the rule holds:

- ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" so it likely corresponds to red.
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" so it likely corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" so it likely corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" so it likely corresponds to blue.

With these associations, let's check against the examples:

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Explanation: ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times, ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
Explanation: ""Wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times. ""Bluf"" does not appear in other examples, and its output is not repeated, its corresponding color is not important for the rule regarding ""walm.""

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: ""Wif"" to red, ""walm"" repeats this color, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats this color again.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Explanation: ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Explanation: ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" repeats this color, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow again, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green.

The rule for ""walm"" holds true for all examples:

Rule: walm -> Triggers output of the same color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.07802930004406446,59,walm
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's inspect the outputs following the appearance of ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. wif walm dax -> red red red green
2. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
3. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Notably, after ""walm"" appears in the input, the color in the output is repeated as follows:

- After ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" so the count is three reds.
- After ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the output is two blues.
- After ""wif walm zup walm,"" there are three reds followed by three yellows.
- After ""dax walm,"" there are three greens.
- After ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" there are three yellows following the first instance of ""walm.""

It seems that ""walm"" causes the next color word in the sequence to be output three times. Here's the rule based on the observed patterns:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The next color word in the output will be repeated three times.",-0.11759701441053762,59,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each example:

- In examples 1 and 4, ""walm"" results in three consecutive ""red"" outputs.
- In example 2, ""walm"" occurs at the end and results in two consecutive ""blue"" outputs.
- In example 3, both occurrences of ""walm"" result in three consecutive ""yellow"" outputs.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug zup,"" and ""lug"" has a singular output ""blue"" while ""zup"" has two ""yellow"" outputs, but ""walm"" still results in three consecutive ""blue"" outputs.

The common pattern here is that ""walm"" consistently results in a triplet of the same color. Additionally, the color appears to change depending on the word that comes before ""walm"":

- When the preceding word is ""wif,"" the color is red.
- When the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow.
- When the preceding word is ""dax,"" the color is green.
- The color is also blue when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" or when it appears at the end of the sequence.

Based on these observations, we can deduce a rule about the meaning of ""walm"":
Rule: ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, outputting that color three times.

There could be an exception to this rule when ""walm"" appears at the end of the sequence, as seen in example 2. In this case, it might default to ""blue,"" but that is not certain based on the provided examples. In the case of example 5, ""lug"" is directly before ""walm,"" and ""lug"" associates with ""blue,"" so it follows the initial rule without exception.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

- In examples 2 and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again, which is blue, so ""bluf"" takes blue in the output.

However, when ""bluf"" comes after a different word, it does not repeat the color of the previous word (like ""wif lug bluf"" which outputs ""red blue blue"" and not ""red blue red"").

So the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color mentioned previously, if the previous word is the same. If the previous word is different, ""bluf"" just translates to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" in the context of these examples is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previously mentioned color if the preceding word is the same, otherwise ""bluf"" means blue.",-0.9435103739929575,60,bluf

There is no example of ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" so we can not determine what ""bluf"" would mean in that context. 

Rule: bluf after lug -> blue, bluf after wif -> red.",-1.0700156886352112,60,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the provided examples. One thing to note is that ""walm"" appears multiple times in some inputs, suggesting it may have a consistent meaning or function across different contexts.

From the first input: 

""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""

And the second input: 

""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""

Compare the two outputs, noticing where the word ""walm"" appears:

- In the first input and output, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug"", and it corresponds to consecutive ""green"" colors in the output.
- In the second input and output, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug"", and corresponds to double ""red"" in the output. We see that when ""walm"" precedes another ""walm"", it results in an additional ""yellow"" in the output after ""blue"".

From the third example:

""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""

We see a ""green"" corresponding with ""dax"", followed by ""walm"" which results again in ""green"". This time ""walm"" is between two ""dax"" entries and does not result in duplication.

In the fourth example:

""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""

Here, ""walm"" follows a ""zup"" and translates to triple ""yellow"" in the output.

Now the fifth example:

""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""

In this sequence, each instance of ""walm"" after a ""dax"" translates into a ""green"" in the output.

The rule appears to be associated with duplication or triplication of the color in the output sequence that corresponds to the word preceding ""walm"". Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by a non-""walm"" word, the corresponding color (""green"") is duplicated.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" the preceding color (in this case ""red"") is duplicated.
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", the corresponding color (""yellow"") is triplicated.
4. When ""walm"" follows directly after another ""walm"", the last color before the occurrence of the first ""walm"" seems to be repeated (noticed with ""yellow"" after ""blue"").
5. In a standalone scenario, ""walm"" following ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"".

Given these observations, ""walm"" seems to be a function that affects the output color based on its position relative to other words. It looks as though ""walm"" may act as an instruction to repeat the color of the word that comes before it, with specific rules depending on what that word is.

For simplicity and based on the given data, a speculative rule could be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> duplicates or triplicates the color associated with the preceding word, with specific rules on duplication or triplication contingent on the context provided by the adjacent words.

Without more examples or clarification, a more precise definition of ""walm"" is challenging to pin down.",-0.08729115038975452,60,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following pattern:

1. When the word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three ""yellow.""
2. When the word ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is two ""red.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or stands alone, the output includes an additional ""green.""

Now, let's try to align these observations with the outputs:

- In the first example (Input: zup wif dax walm lug), ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and the output is ""green green blue,"" followed by ""walm"" after ""lug"" resulting in ""green green."" Subsequently, ""zup"" typically corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence ""yellow"" precedes the ""green green green."" Therefore, we see ""yellow red green green green blue"" in the output.

- In the second example (Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm), ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output corresponding to the first ""walm"" is ""red red."" Then ""lug"" typically corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" preceding the last ""walm"" results in three ""yellow.""

- The third example (Input: dax walm wif dax) has ""walm"" following ""dax,"" resulting in an added ""green"" after the first ""green."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and another ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""

- The fourth example (Input: lug wif dax zup walm) has ""walm"" following ""zup,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" after the ""blue red green"" sequence corresponding to ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax,"" respectively.

- In the fifth example (Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm), every ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" each time resulting in an extra ""green.""

From these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color denoted by the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" The number of repetitions seems to be determined by the color or position of ""walm"" in the sequence:
- Following ""zup"" results in three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- Following ""lug"" results in two repetitions of ""red.""
- Following ""dax"" or alone adds one repetition of ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the preceding word a certain number of times, which varies based on the specific preceding word.",-0.4098474221019454,60,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the nonce word ""walm"".

1. In ""zup wif dax walm lug"", ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and is followed by ""lug"" resulting in ""green green green blue"".
2. In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"", and precedes ""zup"", it corresponds to ""red red blue yellow yellow yellow"".
3. In ""dax walm wif dax"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is succeeded by ""wif"", which corresponds to ""green green green"".
4. In ""lug wif dax zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
5. In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"" and then again follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green green green"".

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" represents the color (""yellow"" or ""green"") of the preceding word, but it must be repeated as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned. For instance, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", and ""dax walm"" to either ""green green green"" or just ""green"" depending on the context. This recurrence seems to be influenced by the context in which ""walm"" appears.

Rule: walm -> the color of the preceding word with repetition based on the context (either threefold repetition as in the first, second, and fourth examples, or matching the number of ""walm"" occurrences as in the fifth example or the implied pattern of the third example).",-0.49390253095927267,60,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" correlates with the color green. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. However, in some instances, the occurrence of ""walm"" results in multiple repetitions of the word ""green"" in the output. It seems that the word ""walm"" may not only translate directly to green, but it may also indicate the repetition of the word green based on context or position.

Here is what seems to be happening:

Example 1:
- zup = yellow
- wif = red
- dax = green
- walm lug = green green green (walm seems to cause 'green' to repeat the number of times ""lug"" comes after ""walm"")

Example 2:
- dax = green
- wif = red
- lug = blue
- zup walm = yellow yellow yellow (walm is now after ""zup"" and causes 'yellow' to repeat three times)

Example 3 never repeats the color red, which corresponds to ""wif."" We should consider what's unique about ""wif"" compared to ""zup"" and ""lug"". ""Wif"" comes after ""walm"" in Example 2 yet ""red"" doesn't repeat; this might suggest ""walm"" affects the repetition only of the word that follows it, not the one that precedes it.

Example 4:
- lug = blue
- wif = red
- dax = green
- zup walm = yellow yellow yellow (again ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times)

Example 5:
- dax = green
- wif = red
- lug = blue
- dax walm = green green green (here ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times)

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" potentially means:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word that follows its closest color descriptor to repeat a number of times corresponding to its immediate context or sequence.

However, it's important to note that there may not be enough consistent patterns to completely rule out other interpretations because of a limited dataset provided. It could be a coincidence that repetitions occur, so the rule derived might not be comprehensive. Additional examples would help refine the rule.

Regardless, based on the available information, we can propose the following tentative rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to repeat. The number of repetitions seems to depend on the immediate sequence context or may correlate to the position of ""walm"" and its following words.",-0.6861695032972729,60,walm
"Given the examples you've provided, let's examine the patterns that emerge particularly around the use of the nonce word 'walm':

1. In every instance, the word 'walm' seems to result in the output color 'green'.
2. However, in some cases, the output consists of repeated colors and the word 'walm' is not always the direct antecedent of the color 'green'. This suggests that 'walm' may influence not only the color that immediately follows but may also influence the repetition of a certain color.
3. The repetition of 'green' appears to be determined by the position of 'walm' relative to the other words.
4. After taking a closer look at the pattern, it seems that 'walm' causes the color that follows it to repeat until another color is mentioned.
5. When 'walm' is used, the following word is always 'lug' which corresponds to 'green' when 'walm' is not present.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

- The word 'walm' results in the repetition of the next color mentioned until a different color word is encountered.

Hence, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: walm -> repeat the next color until a different color word appears.",-1.4657911058263635,60,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it is possible to induce a rule for what the nonce word ""lug"" could mean. Looking at the input and the corresponding output patterns, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""lug.""

In all outputs, the presence of ""lug"" corresponds to multiple occurrences of the color ""blue."" There does not seem to be a case where ""lug"" corresponds to a different color or set of colors. Moreover, the color ""blue"" is repeated following the appearance of ""lug,"" often as many times as ""lug"" and following words occur. Another notable point is that ""lug"" does not seem to affect the translation of other words that have already been established; for instance, ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" to ""red,"" whenever ""lug"" is not present.

Here's an observed pattern: If ""lug"" precedes a word, that word also translates to ""blue,"" but if it’s a standalone word or at the end, ""lug"" only translates to one occurrence of ""blue.""

Let's apply this to the examples:

1. In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" translates to ""red"" and influences ""bluf"" to also translate to ""blue"" despite ""bluf"" not being in the known color translations.

2. In the second example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" The presence of ""lug walm zup lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow blue,"" confirming that only the word following ""lug"" turns to ""blue,"" and the appearance of ""zup"" breaks the pattern.

3. The third and fourth examples add support to the idea that ""lug"" and any word following it are represented as ""blue.""

4. Finally, the fifth example demonstrates that when ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" both are represented by their established translations, ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Given this, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and it causes the following word to also translate to ""blue,"" unless the following word has an established translation (like ""zup"" being ""yellow"").

lug -> blue (and makes the following word blue as well, if not already established)",-0.8681917392081394,61,lug
"Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" repeated the same number of times as the preceding color word's repetition.

Examples:

1. wif walm lug bluf
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""walm"" leads to ""red""
   - ""lug"" follows ""walm"" which was ""red red"", so leads to ""blue blue""
   - ""bluf"" leads to ""blue""

2. zup dax lug walm zup lug
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""lug"" follows ""dax"" which was ""green"", so leads to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" leads to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" follows ""zup"" which was ""yellow"", so leads to ""blue""

3. zup walm lug
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" follows ""walm"" which was ""yellow yellow"", so leads to ""blue blue""

4. lug walm
   - ""lug"" at the beginning of the sentence seems to default to a single ""blue""
   - ""walm"" leads to ""blue""

5. zup lug zup bluf lug
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" follows ""zup"" which was ""yellow"", so leads to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" (or ""yellow"") which was ""yellow"", so leads to ""blue""

Based on the pattern observed, ""lug"" translates to a series of ""blue(s)"" with the quantity matching the immediate preceding color word's quantity. If ""lug"" is the first word, it defaults to one instance of ""blue"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's first list the outputs associated with each input, focusing on the pattern that emerges when ""walm"" is used:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
5. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow

In each case, the color that appears immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times after ""walm"". 

This suggests that the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" three times.

Rule: If x is the word preceding ""walm"" and the output color for x is y, then walm translates to y y y.",-0.11983492274037648,61,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correlate with a series of colors being repeated. The color that is repeated is the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's the rule induction based on each input-output pair:

- In ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" Here, ""walm"" appears to take the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green, and repeats it three times.
- In ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" and the output color associated with ""lug"" is blue. ""Walm"" causes this blue to be repeated three times before the sequence continues with the colors for ""zup"" and ""wif.""
- ""Lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" supporting the idea that ""walm"" causes the color for ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated three times.
- For ""dax zup dax walm,"" the last color before ""walm"" is green (associated with ""dax""), and the result is ""green green green,"" again suggesting the repetition rule for ""walm.""
- Lastly, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" has ""walm"" following ""zup,"" and the output has three yellows in a row, indicating that ""walm"" again repeats the color associated with the word just before it.

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""

And when ""walm"" follows a sequence, the color corresponding to the immediate preceding word is repeated three times:

- ""dax zup dax walm"" results in ""green yellow green green green"" (the ""dax"" immediately before ""walm"" translates to ""green"" repeated three times)

4. ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red"" but is preceded by ""green"" when placed after ""dax"".
5. ""dax"" seems to translate to ""green"" every time it appears.

2. The appearance of ""dax"" does not alter the sequence of other colors associated with other words.

From the second input example, ""dax"" appears between two ""lug"" words, which correspond to the color blue, and the output color for ""dax"" is green.

Again in the third input example, ""dax"" is surrounded by the word ""lug,"" and it maps to the color green in the output.

In the fourth input example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" with ""dax"" mapping to green and ""bluf"" mapping to red in the output.

4. wif lug -> red blue

Examples to illustrate:

- ""dax wif lug dax"" -> ""green red blue green"" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax,"" which means ""green,"" repeats after the ""red.""
- ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow"" Here, there is no word before ""wif"" to repeat.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

In this instance, ""bluf"" appears to translate to ""blue"" instead of ""yellow."" Looking more closely at the examples, another pattern emerges where ""bluf"" seems to generate two outputs – one of which is always the color blue.

Considering this, ""bluf"" might signify doubling the last color mentioned before it, and one of those colors is blue. To test this hypothesis, we can check all instances where ""bluf"" appears:

- zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is yellow), results in ""yellow yellow""
    
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is yellow), results in ""yellow yellow""
    
- lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
- ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue), resulting in ""blue blue""
- ""bluf"" again follows ""lug"" (which is blue), and paired with another ""blue""
    
- wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
- ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue), results in ""blue blue""

- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is yellow), results in ""yellow yellow""

It should be noted that ""walm"" is an unknown term that does not appear to directly affect the output related to ""bluf."" This confirms that ""bluf"" doubles the last mentioned color along with blue, irrespective of the intervening terms.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples, we need to analyze the pattern of inputs and their respective outputs. Let's break down each example:

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

By examining the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we observe:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
4. ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""

Now let's focus on the placement of ""walm"" in each input:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm."" It translates to ""green red blue green green,"" which could imply ""walm"" repeats the pattern of the previous colors except for when it is followed by ""lug"" where it seems to use the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is three times ""yellow."" This could suggest that ""walm"" repeats the previous color unless followed by a different color word.

- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively, with the output being a repetition of the previous colors.

- In the last example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" just like in the first example, and the output once again is a sequence of the previous color (""yellow"") followed by ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word unless it is followed by a different color word, in which case it takes the color of that following word. Notably, when ""walm"" is at the end or is followed by another ""walm,"" it simply repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the previous word unless it is followed by a different color word, in which case it takes the color of that following word. If ""walm"" is at the end or is followed by another ""walm,"" it repeats the color of the previous word.",-0.05610166573710308,62,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" is a rule dependent on the context of the preceding word(s). Let's analyze each input/output pair:

Example 1:
Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" leading to the output green (since ""dax"" hase been associated with green). However, later ""walm"" appears again after ""lug dax"" and again leads to the output green.

Example 2:
Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""Walm"" comes after ""zup"" and results in three occurrences of yellow.

Example 3:
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- Like the previous example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" after a ""zup"" and we see green output three times.

Example 4:
Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- Observing a pattern similar to the second and third examples, ""walm"" after ""dax"" gives a triple green output again.

Example 5:
Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and as seen in prior examples, when following ""zup"", ""walm"" results in a triple yellow output.

Taking all of these examples into account, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: when encountering ""walm"", repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm"" three additional times. If there are two words before ""walm"", such as ""lug dax walm"", ignore the first one and repeat the color of the second word three times.

Rule:
walm -> When the word ""walm"" is encountered, output the color associated with the immediately preceding word three additional times. If ""walm"" follows two words, the color of the immediately preceding word is repeated three times, with the first word's color being ignored in the repetition.",-0.0660897646074433,62,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" translates to repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the rationale:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in additional ""green"" outputs.
- In the second to fourth examples, ""walm"" follows different words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"") and replicates their corresponding colors (yellow, blue, and green, respectively).

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

Let's now apply this rule to the examples given:

1. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm""
   - dax -> green, walm -> green (repeating the color of dax), wif -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green, walm -> green (repeating the color of dax)

2. ""wif dax zup walm""
   - wif -> red, dax -> green, zup -> yellow, walm -> yellow (repeating the color of zup)

3. ""lug zup dax walm""
   - lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, dax -> green, walm -> green (repeating the color of dax)

4. ""dax zup dax walm""
   - dax -> green, zup -> yellow, dax -> green, walm -> green (repeating the color of dax)

5. ""lug zup walm lug""
   - lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, walm -> yellow (repeating the color of zup), lug -> blue

This rule induction matches all the examples presented, suggesting that ""walm"" indeed means repeating the color of the preceding word.",-0.2708584612229175,62,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following rules for individual words:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

We can observe that the sequence preceding ""walm"" always ends with a specific color word, and that the word ""walm"" is then followed by repetitions of this color in the output.

Now looking at the word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". The output after ""walm"" is ""green"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"". The output after ""walm"" is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the third example, the pattern repeats with ""dax"" followed by three ""greens"".
- In the fourth example, the same pattern follows with ""dax"" and three ""greens"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug"", resulting in two ""yellow"" outputs before returning to ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

- walm -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input three times in the output.

- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"". Similar to the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is a repetition of the color associated with ""zup.""
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""blue red green green red blue"". The sequence of colors before ""bluf"" is blue red green, and after ""bluf,"" we have green red blue. Notice that ""green"" is the color associated with ""dax,"" which precedes ""bluf,"" and ""red"" with ""wif"" has been repeated before and after ""bluf"".
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red red"". Here, the color for ""zup"" is repeated twice before all subsequent colors follow.
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" becomes ""red red blue yellow"". Again, the color for ""wif"" is repeated immediately after ""bluf,"" and the rest of the colors follow as usual.

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the color associated with the immediately preceding word being repeated in the output before continuing with the regular sequence of colors associated with the remaining words.

- For ""zup bluf,"" the color is yellow because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" follows with yellow.
- In ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and since ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" is green. The words ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" are paired with their corresponding colors blue, red, and green respectively.

1. 'zup' appears at the start or middle, with the output consistently showing 'yellow' for its position regardless of the preceding or following words. It seems independent of context.
2. 'zup' never occurs at the end of the input without being followed by at least one other word; thus, we can't tell if the following colors are influenced by 'zup' or purely by the subsequent words.

- In the first example: ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example: ""wif walm dax zup"" gives ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" causing ""red"" to repeat three times.

Input: dax walm wif zup  
Output: green green green red yellow  
Now ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and there are three instances of ""green."" There's a possibility that the presence of ""walm"" changes the color that ""dax"" corresponds to, however, considering the first and third examples, it is still consistent with the color ""green"" for ""dax"" and three reds following ""wif.""

Input: lug walm wif zup wif  
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red  
Here, ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" followed by three blues which can be assumed to be a result of ""walm,"" then ""wif"" precedes ""red,"" ""zup"" converts to ""yellow,"" and the final ""wif"" returns to ""red.""

Input: zup wif walm  
Output: yellow red red red  
""Zup"" begins with ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" which gives us ""red,"" and immediately after ""walm"" we observe three reds again.

Summarizing this information:

- ""dax"" becomes ""green,""
- ""wif"" produces a single ""red"",
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and
- ""lug"" turns into ""blue.""

1. ""dax wif walm"" Output -> ""green red red red""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""walm"" is followed by three repeats of ""red"" which is the color associated with ""wif""

- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""walm"" is followed by two repeats of ""red"" which is the color associated with ""wif""

- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""

3. ""dax walm wif zup"" Output -> ""green green green red yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""walm"" is followed by two repeats of ""green"" which is the color associated with ""dax""

4. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" Output -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""walm"" follows with two repeats of ""blue""
- ""wif"" produces ""red""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" again produces ""red""

5. ""zup wif walm"" Output -> ""yellow red red red""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""walm"" follows with three repeats of ""red""

In all the examples, ""walm"" is followed by a series of the same color that precedes it. It may vary how many repeats occur, but the important part is that it causes a repetition of the color word that comes immediately before ""walm"".

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" After ""walm,"" all subsequent words are ""red"" until the end of the input (there are no other color words after ""walm"" to reset the pattern).

- The second and third examples show that when a new word associated with a color (like ""dax"" for ""green"" or ""zup"" for ""yellow"") comes after ""walm,"" the pattern of ""red"" is broken, and the new color is outputted.

- The fourth example confirms the pattern, as all words following ""walm"" are ""red"" until ""zup"" changes the output to ""yellow,"" and subsequent ""wif"" is then interpreted as ""red"" again.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes all following words to be interpreted as ""red"" until a new color word appears, which resets the output to a new color associated with that word.

- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" maps to ""red yellow yellow red green"". Here, ""wif"" is used twice and both times it maps to ""red"".
- ""zup wif"" maps to ""yellow red"". Here ""zup"" is ""yellow"", followed by ""wif"", which must be ""red"".
- ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red red"". Since ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""wif"" is used in the sequence before, ""wif"" must again correspond to ""red"".
- ""zup lug wif"" maps to ""yellow blue red"". Here again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Every instance of ""wif"" in the example sentences maps to the word ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce:

In the second example:
- ""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" which leads to ""blue"" followed by ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color is ""yellow"" before ""green"".

The third example shows:

- ""zup"" again leads to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" consistently, and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"".

Across all examples, ""zup"" is consistently producing the output of ""yellow"" regardless of the words that precede or follow it.

"Given the examples, we can infer that ""walm"" signifies repeating the color that immediately precedes it three more times. We'll go through the examples to show how this works:

1. ""zup wif walm"" becomes ""yellow red red red."" ""wif"" is red, and following ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated twice more, for a total of three times.
2. ""lug dax walm wif"" becomes ""blue green green green red."" Here, ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated twice more before the sequence continues with ""wif,"" which is red.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.",-0.10685422371234563,65,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in the output corresponding to the different inputs where ""walm"" appears:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: yellow red red red
2. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> Output: blue green green green red
3. ""zup walm"" -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
4. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> Output: yellow red green green green
5. ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: yellow red red red (repeat of example 1)

In each instance where ""walm"" appears, it appears that the following occurs in the output:
- The color before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

To confirm this rule, let's look closely at the examples:

1. ""zup wif walm"" has red before ""walm,"" and the output repeats red three times after yellow, which corresponds to ""zup.""
2. ""lug dax walm wif"" has green before ""walm,"" and the output repeats green three times after blue, which corresponds to ""lug.""
3. ""zup walm"" has yellow before ""walm"" with no other words between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" and the output is yellow three times.
4. ""zup wif dax walm"" has green before ""walm,"" and the output repeats green three times after yellow and red.

Based on these outputs, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output. Since example 5 is a repeat of example 1, it further reinforces the pattern without providing new information.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The color word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input is repeated three times in the output.",-0.12197654262160496,65,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' determines the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. Each time 'walm' follows a color word, that color word's corresponding color is repeated multiple times in the output. Let's examine the examples:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Here, 'walm' comes after 'wif,' which corresponds to red, and red is repeated three times in the output.

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
Again, 'walm' is following 'dax,' which corresponds to green, and green is repeated three times prior to 'wif', which corresponds to red. 

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Here, 'walm' comes directly after 'zup,' which corresponds to yellow, and yellow is repeated three times in the output.

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
In this case, 'walm' follows 'dax' (green), and green is repeated three times after the sequence 'yellow red'.

From the above, we can induce:

Similarly, if ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" which correlates to ""green,"" then ""walm"" would repeat the color ""green"" multiple times.

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif (Output: yellow green green green yellow red)
    - ""Zup"" precedes ""dax"" (yielding ""yellow green"") and then comes after ""walm"" before another ""zup"" and then ""wif"". We don't have any prior definition for ""walm"", but we see that the output is ""green green"" after ""dax"" before it goes back to ""yellow"" for the second ""zup"".

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" does not correspond to a single static color. Instead, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it, continuing until a new non-walm word is encountered. For example:

- In the first input, after ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue), ""walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color blue until ""zup"" changes the sequence to yellow.
- In the fourth input, after ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), ""walm lug"" results in ""green green blue,"" repeating green once for ""walm"" before ""lug"" changes the color to blue.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

"Walm -> meaning. Meaning based on the patterns in the example seems to be that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it.

When ""walm"" occurs at the end of an input sequence, its color takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Thus, in the context of these examples, the general rule would be:

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup

- ""dax"" alone results in ""green"", and when ""dax"" is combined with other words it still produces ""green""
- ""bluf"" has only appeared once, and it corresponded to ""green""
- ""walm"" consistently results in ""green""

Now, let's take a closer look at ""dax"":

1. In the first example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"".

2. In the second example, the sequence ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" includes ""dax"", and its corresponding translation is ""green"" situated between ""red"" and ""green"".

3. In the third example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" includes ""dax"", which again corresponds to ""green"" situated in between ""blue"" and ""red"".

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" on its own translates directly to ""green"".

5. In the fifth example, ""lug zup dax walm"" includes ""dax"", which results in ""green"", and it is situated after ""yellow"" and before ""green"".

"Analyzing the examples provided, it seems that each word translates to a specific color, and ""walm"" is one of the words that translates to a color. Let's break down each example to see the pattern:

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
- From this, it can be inferred that ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""dax"" is ""green"", as established. The repetition of the colors in the output suggests that ""walm"" is ""blue"" because it repeats thrice, in the same way the word ""lug"" does.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". Again, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" because ""blue"" is directly following ""walm"" in the output.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"". The word ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""dax"", and ""blue"" repeats twice right before ""green"", which suggests once again that ""walm"" is ""blue"".

Based on the above analysis, the consistent rule seems to be that ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all examples.

Rule: walm -> blue",-0.059275793906648916,67,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can see that each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to a specific color in the output sequence. To deduce the rule for walm, let's align the examples by the nonce word and examine the corresponding outputs:

1. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
4. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
5. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green

Analyzing these examples:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug"", and the corresponding output colors are ""green green green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"". 
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which gives the output ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""zup"".
- In example 3, the first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup"", corresponding to ""green green green"" and ""yellow"". The second ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif bluf dax bluf wif"", and the pattern of ""red red green green red red"" can be seen with ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"", ""green"" to ""dax"", and no color directly attributable to ""bluf"". ""lug"" follows ""walm"", which as seen before corresponds to ""blue"".
- In example 5, ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax"", and the corresponding colors are ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""green"" for ""dax"".

From these observations, it can be noticed that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output; instead, it seems to repeat the pattern of the preceding word. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color sequence of the word before it in the input.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color sequence of the preceding word.",-0.08802146488435107,67,walm
"Based on the given examples, I will attempt to deduce the rule or meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" For each input, I will associate the word ""walm"" with the corresponding output and look for a pattern.

- Example 1: dax walm lug -> green green green blue
- Example 2: zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- Example 3: dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
- Example 4: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
- Example 5: lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green

In each output sequence, the word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of color words. The number of repetitions and color that follows ""walm"" seems dependent on the word that comes right before it. Here's what we see:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.
  
There's a consistent repetition of one color three times after the word ""walm."" However, we don't have an example with ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" which inhibits us from confidently applying the same rule to these words.

With the available information, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color word that follows the word immediately preceding ""walm."" This repetition is threefold.

Hence, we can define:

walm -> Causes the output of the color word corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.0945379215413404,67,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" serves as a colour descriptor that matches the colour described by the preceding word. Each instance of ""walm"" immediately follows a word corresponding to a colour, resulting in the replication of the same colour multiple times.

Here is the rationale derived from the examples:

- ""dax walm lug"" resulted in ""green green green blue,"" indicating that ""dax"" represents the colour green, which is replicated three times due to the presence of ""walm"".
- ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests ""zup"" represents yellow, again replicated thrice because of ""walm"".
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" creating three greens, and ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" produces three blues.
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red"". Here ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" is red. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" resulting in a repetition of ""red"".
- ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green"". Here ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""walm"" creating three blues, and ""dax"" is green.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the colour indicated by the previous word to be repeated three times.

Therefore: 
walm -> When following a colour descriptor, triples the colour output associated with that descriptor.",-0.10141570236053188,67,walm
"Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" seems to be a rule that applies to the word that precedes it, changing the output color of the previous word from its original color to a new sequence of the same color repeated three times.

Let's look at examples:

1. Original word ""dax"" outputs green, but when followed by ""walm"" the output is ""green green green"" instead of just one ""green"".
2. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" changes the output color of ""zup"" to a repeated sequence.
3. When ""lug walm"" is used, ""lug"" which normally outputs ""blue"" when alone, outputs ""blue blue blue"" with ""walm"" following it.
4. ""wif"" originally outputs red, and followed by ""walm"" the output is ""red red red"".

So, based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color output associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.

"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". Each example correlates the inputs with color outputs, and by comparing them, we can figure out what each word translates to in terms of color.

Let's examine the inputs and outputs:

- Every time ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
- Every time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.7266100125020243,68,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's look at the color outputs associated with its occurrences while taking into account the colors associated with other words that appear in the input.

Considering the first example:
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

We see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", both at the start and at the end. ""Wif"" seems to lead to ""red"", and ""dax"" leads to ""green"". In between the first ""zup"" and ""wif"", there's a ""bluf"", and it leads to another ""yellow"". It could be that ""bluf"" means the same as the word immediately preceding it, which is ""zup"" in this case, hence leading to the color ""yellow"".

In the second and third examples, the input is identical:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and both lead to ""yellow"", which is consistent with the initial observation that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Now considering the fourth example:
Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Here, ""bluf"" follows a ""zup"" and both result in ""yellow"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". This example also supports the hypothesis.

The fifth example also provides insight:
Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and both result in ""blue"". This seems to reinforce the pattern that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

bluf -> meaning: The color of the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".

Rule: ""bluf"" results in the same color output as the word that comes before it in the sequence.",-0.1400928721805904,68,bluf
"Given the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs to the corresponding outputs.

Looking at the first example input ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" and its output ""yellow yellow red green red yellow,"" we see that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Now let's apply these findings to the other examples:

- In the second and third examples, ""zup bluf"" consistently outputs ""yellow yellow,"" which seems to indicate that ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

- However, in the fourth example ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and given that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" again seems to correspond to ""yellow.""

- In the last example, ""dax zup lug bluf,"" we already deduced ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue"" here.

We have a slight issue since ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"" in the second and third examples, while in the fourth it corresponds to ""yellow,"" and in the fifth, it matches ""blue."" This inconsistency might indicate that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that directly follows the one represented by the previous word in a predefined sequence.

Let's consider a potential color sequence that might be repeating: yellow (zup), red (wif), green (dax), blue (lug). With that logic, since ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) in the fifth example and matches ""blue,"" and given that yellow follows blue in this hypothetical sequence, ""bluf"" could be following the color of the word it is after in sequence.

The rule is as follows:

- When ""bluf"" immediately follows a color word, it matches the next color in the sequence (e.g., after ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" is ""yellow"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), since there's no color word before ""zup"" to indicate a sequence, it defaults to ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule help deduce the meaning seems to be:
Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows the prior color word in a sequence, or if ""zup"" is before ""bluf"", it defaults to ""yellow.""",-0.37770372169108435,68,bluf
"Observing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" based on the consistent output that follows it.

1. Example one shows that the sequence ""bluf wif dax wif zup"" results in ""yellow red green red yellow."" We can recognize that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" from the given examples. However, we need to focus on ""bluf"" and what follows it to understand its meaning or rule.

2. The second and third examples show that ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean or translate to ""yellow"" as well, but these examples alone don’t give us enough context since there are no other words to compare it against.

3. The fourth example may provide more insight. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" We see that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Thus, in this context, ""bluf"" follows a ""zup"" and precedes a ""lug,"" yet the color for ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" This supports the idea that ""bluf"" may indeed mean ""yellow.""

4. The fifth example, ""dax zup lug bluf,"" translates to ""green yellow blue blue."" This is the first instance where ""bluf"" is directly followed by an output color different from ""yellow,"" specifically ""blue."" Yet it does not follow the previous pattern of ""bluf"" meaning ""yellow.""

With these examples, we can deduce a tentative rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow."" When it is not immediately preceded by ""zup,"" it translates to ""blue."" However, this rule is based on limited examples and might not hold true in all contexts.

Therefore, the current deduction is:

bluf -> meaning. When following ""zup,"" ""bluf"" likely means ""yellow""; otherwise, it translates to ""blue.""",-0.4057441615135542,68,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, we can make some observations:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is output in the same position as ""zup"" and immediately followed by another ""yellow"" where ""bluf"" was. This suggests that ""bluf"" may correspond directly to ""yellow"" when following ""zup.""

2. In the instance where ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" the color ""blue"" appears where ""lug"" is located. This might initially suggest that ""bluf"" could relate to ""blue,"" but the other examples contradict that.

3. The last example provides a valuable clue: ""bluf"" appears immediately after ""lug,"" yet the output color is ""blue,"" not yellow. However, ""bluf"" is followed by another instance of ""blue.""

Based on these observations, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" serves as a duplicator or repeater of the color that directly precedes it in the output. When ""bluf"" follows a word that has been translated to a color, the output color at the position of ""bluf"" will be the same as the color that precedes it.

Meanwhile, other words such as ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" correspond with their own colors, but consistently so (based on the information given).

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red."" Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

- walm -> yellow, based on ""walm lug wif"" sequence producing ""yellow blue red""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the input and corresponding output to find patterns. Let's start by comparing the inputs and outputs with appearances of ""walm.""

2. Input: dax lug walm

4. Input: lug walm wif lug

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm

By comparing these examples, we notice that ""walm"" always translates to ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input string. Other words preceding and following ""walm"" result in different colors, but ""walm"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> meaning. Rule: walm translates to the color ""red.""",-0.06635257626142156,69,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, we can notice a pattern in which the word ""walm"" is translated into outputs:

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, we can derive the following observations:

1. ""Walm"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
2. The word preceding ""walm"" does not affect its corresponding output, as seen by the variable words preceding ""walm"" (""wif"", ""dax"", ""lug"") all resulting in the output color ""red"" for ""walm"".
3. In every output, ""walm"" is consistently followed by a sequence of ""red"" except for the case where it is the last word in the sequence. This means that ""walm"" outputs a ""red"" and also triggers a repeat of the same color for the following terms until a new term breaks the pattern.

Considering these observations, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: walm -> triggers one or more ""red"" in the output, with the number of ""red"" being the same as the number of terms following the occurrence of ""walm"" until a different term appears. If ""walm"" is the last word, it results in only one ""red"".",-0.07341486939228432,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's break down each example to find commonalities and differences that can help us determine the rule or meaning behind ""walm.""

1. Input: wif walm zup - Output: red red red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. Input: dax lug walm - Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif - Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

4. Input: lug walm wif lug - Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm - Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow""

From the examples, we can see that each word has its corresponding color except for ""walm."" We will look at the positions where ""walm"" is found and the corresponding output color:

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output color is red.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is the last word and its color is blue, the same as the preceding word ""lug.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output color is red.
- In example 4, ""walm"" occurs between two ""lug"" words both rendered as blue, and ""walm"" itself is also blue.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is the last word and its color is red.

Notice that in examples 2 and 4, ""walm"" is surrounded by the word ""lug"" which corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" follows the same color. However, in other examples, it doesn't adopt the color from the preceding word, as evidenced in examples 1, 3, and 5 with the color red which doesn't match the adjacent colors.

Given that ""walm"" seems to take on the color blue when next to ""lug,"" but otherwise takes on the color red, it appears that ""walm"" has a conditional rule, possibly related to the word preceding it. Observing the patterns, a plausible hypothesis is that ""walm"" is red by default, but it turns blue when it directly follows ""lug.""

Walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" is red unless it directly follows the word ""lug,"" in which case it is blue.",-0.07389549964751962,69,walm
"To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's first identify patterns associated with other words in the inputs and outputs:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" except when adjacent to ""walm.""
- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Now, let's analyze ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of ""red"" followed by one ""yellow.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""blue.""
3. In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to a pattern ""red blue red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes three ""blue"" and follows one ""blue.""
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" has three ""red"" after it.

It seems that ""walm"" affects the colors that come after it, repeating them a certain number of times based on their color in the following pattern:

- Red is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- Blue is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- Yellow is altered when adjacent to ""walm,"" changing to ""blue."" (This can only be seen once in the first example.)

There is not enough information to create a solid rule for ""green,"" as we don't see any ""green"" after ""walm"" directly in these examples.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next color to repeat three times, except for yellow, which changes to a different color (blue based on one instance).

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to repeat three times, except for yellow, which changes to blue.",-1.0246901605667649,69,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" is associated with contributing a certain color to the output string. It's important to observe how the colors change in the presence of ""walm"" and how they correspond with other words.

In the examples, when we see ""walm,"" we notice the following patterns:

1. In every output string that corresponds to an input that contains ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is present.
2. ""Walm"" is followed by ""red"" in every instance except when the word ""lug"" is present before ""walm."" When ""lug"" is present before ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" appears instead of ""red.""

However, it seems that ""walm"" has a stable influence on its own, as when it is only combined with the word ""wif"" (Input: ""wif walm zup""; Output: ""red red red yellow""), ""walm"" results in ""red."" This pattern is observed in each occurrence except when modified by ""lug"" as mentioned in point 2.

Furthermore, ""walm"" may represent a rule rather than a direct translation to a single color because when it is combined with other words (like ""dax"" or ""bluf""), it seems to repeat the color that corresponds to the word before it (as seen in the last example where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" follows suit with repeated ""red"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it contributes to the color pattern of the preceding word in the input, with a specific exception when preceded by ""lug,"" where ""lug"" determines the output color.

- ""walm"" seems to be ""green"" in the output, repeating as many times as it appears in sequence.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.

Whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.",-1.8436468709825005,70,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the commonalities in the input and output pairs:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
4. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
5. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

The word ""bluf"" occurs in all inputs, and in each respective output, the sequence ""red red"" consistently appears. Additionally, every single input word aside from ""bluf"" can be paired with a color in the outputs:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Given that ""bluf"" occurs with ""wif"" just prior to the ""red red"" sequence in every instance where ""wif"" appears, it may seem that ""bluf"" simply repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red."" However, in the fourth input, ""bluf"" stands alone and corresponds to ""yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might take on the color of the word that immediately precedes it, except when it's preceded by ""wif,"" where it then results in a repetition of ""red.""

With the exception of the input pair four where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" we see that ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""red red"" in the output. Thus, we observe the special rule when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" but we cannot confirm a general rule for ""bluf"" when it does not immediately follow ""wif"" as there is only one example that shows ""bluf"" following ""zup"" and resulting in a ""yellow"" in the output.

Considering the evidence provided in the examples, we can assert the following with some degree of certainty:

Rule: When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" However, there isn't sufficient data to fully define ""bluf"" when it does not follow ""wif,"" though it might possibly inherit the color of the preceding word.

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce a pattern to understand what the nonce word ""bluf"" means.

In the first example ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" ""bluf"" yields ""red red yellow blue,"" while ""zup"" appears before the first ""red"" and before ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is at the end after ""blue.""

The second and the fifth examples are the same: ""lug wif bluf"" producing ""blue red red."" Comparing these with the first example, ""lug"" is equated with ""blue"" at the end of the sequence.

In the third example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" showing us that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" 

The fourth example, ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" outputs ""yellow yellow red green blue,"" where ""dax"" appears before ""green,"" and it is the only new addition compared to the other sequences that helps us deduce that ""dax"" stands for ""green.""

By analyzing the recurrence of ""wif"" before every ""red"" and ""lug"" before every ""blue,"" ""bluf"" seems to always correlate with two successive instances of ""red."" 

Also, we can see that words before the colors other than ""bluf"" correspond to a single color—""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green.""

- Input: zup wif lug zup walm
  Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
  Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". Following the pattern, ""walm"" seems to result in repeating the color of the word right before it, which in this case is ""yellow"".

- Input: lug walm zup

- Input: dax lug walm

3. Input: zup walm

4. Input: zup lug walm

5. Input: dax lug walm

Looking at examples 2, 4, and 5, ""walm"" seems to add ""blue"" three times to the sequence, irrespective of the word it follows. In examples 3 and 4, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" further indicating that ""walm"" represents a triplication of the color represented by the word immediately preceding it.

From the other examples, we can deduce the colors associated with the other words:

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" immediately follows another ""zup"", leading to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

2. ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug"", resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times before continuing to ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears between two instances of ""zup"" and both times it translates to ""green,"" with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is repeated twice and the output is three instances of ""yellow,"" which might be suggesting that ""zup"" is ""yellow."" As ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" the presence of only ""walm"" without ""zup"" suggests that ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow""; however, this is the only instance that breaks the pattern, potentially due to a mistake, as all other examples consistently show ""walm"" as ""green.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and both instances of ""walm"" result in ""blue"" as well with ""wif"" again translating to ""red."" This suggests ""walm"" carries the same color as the word before it, which aligns with all other examples except the second one.

- Finally, in the last example, ""zup"" and ""lug"" translate as before to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") resulting in ""green.""

While there seems to be an inconsistency in the second example, every other instance of ""walm"" after a color word translates to that same color word, given that the color word before ""walm"" is ""green"" in every instance.

5. lug dax zup dax wif -> blue green yellow green red

- In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"". When ""zup"" precedes or follows ""bluf"", the output for ""zup"" is also ""yellow"".
- In example 2, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and their corresponding colors are ""green"" and ""yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" does not simply take the color of the following word.
- In example 4, ""zup"" occurs after ""dax"" and before ""wif""; the corresponding colors for ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" are ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively.
- In example 5, ""zup"" occurs between ""dax"" and ""dax"", and the corresponding colors for ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" are ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively.

Based on this data, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position relative to other words or the colors they correspond with.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.10286430777742858,72,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look at the different positions it takes in the input and its corresponding output. The goal is to discern a pattern that associates ""zup"" with a specific color or a set of conditions that consistently lead to the same output.

Observing the examples:

1. When ""zup"" is first in the sequence:
   - Input: zup bluf dax
   - Output: yellow yellow green

2. When ""zup"" is in the middle of the sequence:
   - Input: dax zup bluf
   - Output: green yellow yellow

3. When ""zup"" comes after ""dax"":
   - Input: dax zup lug
   - Output: green yellow blue
   - Input: lug dax zup dax wif
   - Output: blue green yellow green red

4. When ""zup"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"":
   - Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   - Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In all of the examples, irrespective of its position in the sequence, ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Hence, we can deduce a rule:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore:
zup -> yellow",-0.28806231505318675,72,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" To confirm this, let's analyze the placement and output of the word ""zup"" in each input:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" with the corresponding output colors being ""yellow yellow green."" The second ""yellow"" must be attributed to ""bluf,"" as it appears in the third example with the same color output.

- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" and ""lug,"" and the output for these are ""yellow green blue,"" respectively. ""dax"" and ""lug"" have consistent color outputs across all examples. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" meaning ""zup"" must correspond to ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" which is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output sequence is ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""green"" is associated with ""dax"" as in previous examples, and ""yellow"" remains consistent for ""zup"" and ""bluf.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is placed between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and the sequence in the output is ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" Here we focus on the ""green yellow"" part, which is again consistent with the ""dax zup"" sequence we have seen before.

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" and before another ""dax,"" and the sequence in the output is ""blue green yellow green red."" The positions of ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" are consistent, and between them ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.",-0.62915747976011,72,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following mappings for the words:

- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> blue

The word ""zup"" however seems to vary in its output but has a consistent rule associated with its position relative to other known words:

- When preceding a known word, ""zup"" takes the color of the word that follows it.
- When following a known word, ""zup"" takes the color of the word it follows.

This brings us to the conclusion:

Rule:
zup -> Takes the color of the adjacent known word, regardless of whether it precedes or follows it.",-0.9083834634483517,72,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's analyze its occurrences and the output colors:

1. In examples 1 and 3, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output colors for both instances are ""yellow yellow"". This suggests that the appearance of ""zup"" has no impact on ""bluf"" being translated to yellow.

2. In example 1, ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" and the output color for ""dax"" is green. In example 3, ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" and ""dax"" still translates to green. Despite the position change, ""zup"" doesn't appear to affect the color associated with ""dax"".

3. In example 2, ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug"". The output color for ""zup"" is yellow, while ""lug"" translates to blue. However, in example 1, ""lug"" also translates to blue without ""zup"" being present. This suggests that ""zup"" doesn't influence the output color for ""lug"".

4. In example 4, ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" and ""dax"" is associated with the color green both when before and after ""zup"". Furthermore, ""lug"" retains its blue color whether it is before or after ""zup"".

5. Example 5 further confirms that ""dax"" retains its color green and ""lug"" its color blue regardless of their position in relation to ""zup"".

Considering these examples, it seems that the meaning of ""zup"" is independent of its position and does not influence the colors associated with other words. The consistent output for ""zup"" across all five examples is yellow.

Rule:
zup -> yellow",-1.0850150160693406,72,zup
"Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" appears to be correlated with a change in color output from the previous word's output. Here's the assessed pattern:

1. The outputs alternate between two colors until the word ""bluf"" appears, after which the color repeats once before alternating again.
2. ""bluf"" seems to cause the color prior to its occurrence to be repeated once more.

Let's analyze each instance:

- In the first input, the sequence goes red, red, (bluf - which seems to maintain the ""red""), green (due to ""bluf""), green, and then continues alternating with red.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output for ""bluf"" is also green before continuing with the next color.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output for ""bluf"" is another yellow.
- In the fourth input, after the pattern of yellow-green repeats with ""zup"" and ""dax"", ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" (red) and the output is red again.
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and thus the output for ""bluf"" is green as well.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output.",-1.194719332188818,72,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be associated with the color ""green"" in various contexts. In the outputs, whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the presence of other words such as ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug,"" which are associated with their respective colors.

Here are the explained correlations for each example that include ""bluf"":

- Example 1: ""bluf"" appears twice, and both times ""green"" follows in the output.
- Example 2: ""bluf"" appears once, followed by ""green.""
- Example 3: ""bluf"" appears once at the end, and the last color in the output is ""yellow."" Given that the other colors have a one-to-one correlation with a different word, this suggests that there's a change to the meaning when ""bluf"" appears as the last word in the sequence.
- Example 4: ""bluf"" appears once, followed by ""red."" In this case, since ""bluf"" is the last word related to a color, it seems to be that ""bluf"" changes its meaning if it is the last color-related word in a sequence. Otherwise, the rule holds.
- Example 5: ""bluf"" appears once and ""green"" follows.

From examples 1, 2, and 4, we can deduce that ""bluf"" typically means ""green."" However, from examples 3 and 4, where ""bluf"" appears as the last color-related word, it doesn't correlate with ""green"" but with ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively. There is an inconsistency in these examples, which could be a result of a mistake in the dataset or a more complex rule that we do not have enough information to deduce.

Considering most instances where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" we'll tentatively state the rule, while acknowledging the anomalies observed:

Rule: ""bluf"" typically means ""green,"" with exceptions occurring when ""bluf"" is the last color-related word in a sequence, where the meaning may differ. Further examples would be needed to accurately determine the rule for these cases.

bluf -> ""green"" (with noted exceptions)",-1.2840285220023635,72,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs, focusing on the usage of ""bluf.""

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""green.""
2. When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" as well.
3. If ""bluf"" is found after ""zup,"" there's a deviation; the output is ""yellow,"" not green.
4. ""bluf"" does not seem to have a consistent individual color as an output; instead, it's influenced by the word preceding it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to relate to the preceding word. Given that ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax,"" we see ""green"" as the output, but when it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule suggests that ""bluf"" may mean ""repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",-1.3943453241881827,72,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the word or color ""yellow"" when preceding the word ""wif,"" otherwise it translates to the word or color ""green."" Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule:
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is the last word or followed by a word that is not ""wif"" or ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule is:
bluf -> ""yellow"" after ""wif"" or at the end/followed by anything not ""wif"" or ""dax"", otherwise ""green"".",-1.4031308519318184,72,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""green"" in the given context, as each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input correlates with the word ""green"" in the output.",-1.6958912418572731,72,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the association between the input and the output for each example. By examining where ""walm"" is in the input and how it impacts the output, we can try to deduce its meaning or the rule it follows:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup,"" yielding two reds and then a yellow after ""zup."" ""Walm"" at the end seems to add a sequence of yellows after ""zup.""

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""Walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and we see a ""blue"" before and after ""zalm."" It also comes before ""zup,"" leading to a yellow.

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""Walm"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""zup,"" resulting in greens and then a yellow for ""zup.""

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""Walm"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""dax,"" leading to two additional blues and then a green.

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" here, resulting in additional reds.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" either repeats the previous color or adds additional instances of the previous color in sequence, except when it comes before ""zup"" or ""dax,"" which then transitions to either yellow or green respectively. The exact transitions of color after ""walm"" can vary, but the pattern of repetition or continuation is clear.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the previous color output before it (causing a sequence of that color), except when followed by ""zup"" (which turns to yellow) or by ""dax"" (which turns to green).",-0.05516490009054639,72,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first look at the corresponding output for each given example:

1. Input: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm""
   Output: ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""

2. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup""
   Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
   
3. Input: ""zup dax walm zup wif""
   Output: ""yellow green green green yellow red""
   
4. Input: ""lug walm dax""
   Output: ""blue blue blue green""
   
5. Input: ""lug wif walm""
   Output: ""blue red red red""

From these examples, it is possible to conclude that ""walm"" leads to the repeated color output of the word that comes right before it. Let's verify this:

1. Example one has ""wif walm"" which translates to ""red red red,"" and ""zup walm"" which translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. Example two has ""lug walm"" which translates to ""blue blue blue.""
3. Example three has ""dax walm"" which translates to ""green green green.""
4. Example four has ""lug walm"" once again translating to ""blue blue blue.""
5. Example five has ""wif walm"" translating to ""red red red.""

In all examples, the word ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to repeat twice.

Based on the given data, the rule is:

""walm"" -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word twice.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color output for the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" is repeated an additional two times.",-0.08760507016057732,72,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's review the data:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

Analyzing the outputs associated with the input ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the outputs are ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow.""

One possible pattern is that ""walm"" echoes the color of the word preceding it two or more times (as seen with ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green""). However, in the second sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" yet the color ""blue"" is repeated three times instead of two, which is inconsistent with the other examples.

A focus on the second example reveals that though ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the following position (""zup"") impacts the color by adding ""yellow"" after ""blue,"" as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on the data provided, ""walm"" mirrors the color associated with the word preceding it but also influences the color output of the word following it. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it and potentially dictates the color output for the word immediately following it.

However, the rule is not entirely clear regarding how many times it duplicates the color (twice or thrice when it's ""wif"" before ""walm,"" always twice when it's ""lug"" before ""walm,"" and once when it's ""dax"" before ""walm""), nor is it clear how it affects the following word's color (there is an added ""blue"" before ""yellow"" in the second example when ""walm"" follows ""lug""). 

This rule needs more examples to refine and confirm the exact behavior of ""walm,"" especially concerning how many times it duplicates the color and how it interacts with the color of the word following it. 

If we disregard the second example as potentially erroneous, the rule might be simplified to ""walm"" causing the color associated with the preceding word to repeat twice.",-0.10791361593252062,72,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine the patterns surrounding its use in the input and the corresponding color in the output:

1. In the first example, each time ""walm"" is used, the output is ""red red.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""zup,"" and the output is ""blue blue.""
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and the two following words are ""zup wif,"" with the output being ""green green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is sandwiched between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and the output color is ""blue.""
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""

From these examples, we see that when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue,"" and when it follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" When it's between ""lug"" and ""dax"" or after ""lug,"" it's still blue. Following ""dax,"" it becomes green. It seems that the color output for ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it, and it matches the color associated with the preceding word:

- ""lug"" typically corresponds with ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" (but seems to be unaffected by ""walm"")
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" seems to depend on the preceding word, taking on the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the meaning is ""blue,"" if it's ""wif,"" it's ""red,"" and if it's ""dax,"" it's ""green.""",-0.9804390120382473,72,walm
"To deduce the meaning or the rule of the word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs to identify patterns.

- Whenever ""walm"" follows any word, the output seems to be a sequence of ""red"" colors.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the next color after ""blue"" is also ""blue."" For other words, the color following ""walm"" does not remain consistent.
- ""Walm"" itself does not have a fixed color output; depending on its position or surrounding words, its color output can be ""red"" or ""green.""
- ""Walm"" always impacts the following word, except when it is at the end of the sequence.

Given these observations, here's the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the word following it to repeat its designated color output, except when ""walm"" is the last word. If ""walm"" directly follows a word, it takes the color of that word as its output. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it produces ""blue.""

Rule: ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" if it directly follows ""zup"", otherwise it mimics the color output of the word directly preceding it.",-0.10316291514724393,73,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" results in the output ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" and ""yellow"" in all other cases. Reviewing the examples:

1. ""wif dax zup bluf"" -> red green yellow yellow
2. ""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow
3. ""wif bluf dax"" -> red red green
4. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> green blue yellow red red green
5. ""wif zup bluf"" -> red yellow yellow

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" has the following rule:
- When preceded by ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" if immediately preceded by ""wif,"" otherwise it outputs ""yellow"".",-0.1038098431737317,73,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it is translated as ""yellow"" in the output.
- The position of ""bluf"" in the input does not matter; its corresponding output is always ""yellow"".
- Other words in the inputs have consistent corresponding outputs. For example:
  - ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red""
  - ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green""
  - ""zup"" consistently leads to ""yellow"" (the same as ""bluf"")
  - ""lug"" leads to ""blue""

Given these observations, we can induce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",-0.8331593610197561,73,bluf
"Given the examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly correlates with the color ""yellow."" In all instances where ""bluf"" is mentioned, the corresponding output color is ""yellow."" Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- In the second example, the single word ""bluf"" corresponds to the single color ""yellow.""
- The third example has ""bluf"" again followed by ""red,"" but it’s important to note that in this example ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""bluf."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and the rule for ""bluf"" may depend on the word that proceeds it, ""bluf"" here may simply echo the color of the preceding word, resulting in ""red,"" not because ""bluf"" inherently means ""red,"" but because of its placement after ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" which would be explained by its position after ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" but since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" it doesn't provide additional information beyond confirming that ""bluf"" also corresponds with ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" stands alone or follows any word other than ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""yellow."" If ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif,"" it takes on the color of ""wif"" which is ""red.""

Hence, the meaning is:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" generally means ""yellow,"" with a context-dependent change to ""red"" only when following ""wif.""",-1.1913299675267068,73,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"". It doesn't seem to matter where ""bluf"" appears in the input sequence; its presence directly translates to the output ""red"" without depending on the context provided by other words.",-1.521975005890244,73,bluf
"Given the example inputs and outputs, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the constant presence of the word ""walm"" in the input and the recurrence of a particular color pattern in the output.

In the input-output pairs, it can be observed that whenever the word ""walm"" is present:

1. In ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by another word (""lug""), and we get ""red red red"" for ""walm.""

2. In ""dax walm wif dax,"" the output is ""green green green red green."" After ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" the presence of ""walm"" is followed by a ""green"" as well, which is part of the repetition of ""green"" three times.

3. In ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" Again, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""

4. In ""dax walm wif,"" the output is ""green green green red."" Similar to the previous examples, ""walm"" correlates with the ""green"" being repeated thrice.

5. In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output is ""green yellow green green green."" When ""walm"" follows two instances of ""dax"" and one ""zup,"" it results in two more instances of ""green.""

Based on these observations, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repeating of the color that precedes it thrice. Therefore, whenever you see ""walm,"" it implies that we should repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. Considering the consistency of this pattern across all the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.",-0.07603922396236783,73,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the input sequences to their outputs, focusing on where ""walm"" appears.

1. Input: zup wif walm lug - Output: yellow red red red blue
2. Input: dax walm wif dax - Output: green green green red green
3. Input: zup wif walm - Output: yellow red red red
4. Input: dax walm wif - Output: green green green red
5. Input: dax zup dax walm - Output: green yellow green green green

Looking at examples 3 and 4, it seems like the presence of ""walm"" alone after ""zup wif"" or ""dax"" triggers a sequence of three repeated colors before continuing with the pattern.

Now, consider the following observations:
- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and produces ""red red red"" before finishing with blue for ""lug.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" is in between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and it produces ""green green green"" before the red for ""wif"" and then resuming the pattern with green.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence and it produces three greens following ""dax.""

From these instances, it seems ""walm"" invokes a rule where it repeats the color coded to the word that precedes it three times. For ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" it produced three reds; for ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" it produced three greens.

Thus:

walm -> The rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: If ""walm"" is preceded by a word that translates to a color, repeat that color three times in the output.",-0.08963564741379311,73,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's consider the consistent elements and patterns in the provided examples.

By examining each input and its corresponding output line by line, we can observe the following:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm lug""   
   Output: ""yellow red red red blue"" 
   
2.
   Input: ""dax walm wif dax""   
   Output: ""green green green red green""
   
3. 
   Input: ""zup wif walm""   
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   
4. 
   Input: ""dax walm wif""   
   Output: ""green green green red""
   
5. 
   Input: ""dax zup dax walm""   
   Output: ""green yellow green green green""

From the examples, we can notice that the word before ""walm"" consistently translates to the color directly before a series of ""green"" in the output, for example:
- In example 1 and 3, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output has the sequence ""yellow red red red"" before the varied color (either blue or nothing).
- In example 2, 4, and 5, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output has the sequence ""green green green red"" or ""green yellow green green green,"" which all include a repetition of ""green.""

Looking for a pattern specifically regarding the word ""walm,"" we can see that the presence of ""walm"" is connected to the sequence of ""green"" colors which appear in the output. Here are the key observations:
- When ""walm"" is included, we get a sequence of ""green"" in the output.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""dax,"" there are three to four instances of ""green"" following it.
- When ""walm"" is included without a word following it, the sequence of ""green"" ends with ""red.""

However, since there's no direct translation for each occurrence of ""walm"" that maintains consistency across all examples, and we cannot deduce a specific color or rule for ""walm"" alone, it seems that ""walm"" serves more as an indicator or function for a pattern of colors rather than a color itself.

Thus, the rule might be:
Rule: ""walm"" -> indicates a repetition of ""green"" in the output, with the number of greens depending on the surrounding context or the words following ""walm"".",-0.12780262839000006,73,walm
"Rule: walm -> green

Looking at the examples provided, we can observe the following:

- In example 1 (zup wif walm lug), the output for ""walm"" is red. However, in all other examples, the output for ""walm"" is green. We also notice that ""lug"" is translated to blue only in this example.
- In example 2 (dax walm wif dax), ""walm"" is associated with green and we see a consistent pattern with ""dax"" before and after the ""walm"" both also translating to green.
- Example 3 (zup wif walm) omits ""lug"" from example 1 and ""walm"" now translates to red, but the rest of the pattern remains consistent with example 1.
- Example 4 (dax walm wif) follows the pattern of example 2 without the last ""dax"" and ""walm"" still translates to green.
- Example 5 (dax zup dax walm) includes both ""dax"" and ""zup"" before ""walm"" and the pattern we see is that ""walm"" is still translating to green.

From these observations, we can conclude that the color translation for ""walm"" is context-dependent. It becomes red if following ""zup wif"" and green in all other contexts, especially following or preceding ""dax"".

However, since examples 2, 4, and 5 consistently result in ""walm"" being green regardless of the presence of ""wif"", it seems safe to conclude that ""walm"" generally translates to green except in a specific context following ""zup wif"", which is not present in the majority of the examples. Therefore, we assume the default meaning of ""walm"" to be green.",-0.582451834618276,73,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first identify patterns in the input and the corresponding output:

1. The word ""walm"" always results in a consecutive sequence of three greens in the output.
2. The sequence of three greens is always followed by the color red.
3. The appearance of ""walm"" does not seem to be influenced by the words that precede or follow it since it always produces the same sequence regardless of the context.

Given these observations, it appears that ""walm"" leads to the output of three green colors followed by a red color. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples provided and look for patterns:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   
   Before ""zup"" there's a red-yellow-green pattern with the word ""walm"" representing red, ""dax"" representing green, and ""wif"" representing red again. After ""zup,"" the pattern is ""red red yellow.""

2. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   
   ""Zup"" comes first followed by the word ""dax,"" which previously we saw corresponded to green. ""Zup"" in this instance corresponds to yellow.

3. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
   
   Here again, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, which appears just once before ""bluf"". The ""bluf"" seems to start a new pattern of ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red
   
   ""Zup"" translates to yellow, followed by the familiar green for ""dax"" and red for ""wif.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   
   ""Zup"" is followed by ""wif"", contributing to the red color, but ""zup"" stands out with yellow. What follows are ""lug"", associated with the blue color, and ""walm"" with red, but previously we knew ""walm"" as representing red.

Based on the analysis:

- Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned, the next color in the output sequence is always yellow.
- There are color patterns associated with other words, but ""zup"" exclusively correlates to one instance of yellow thereafter.

Rule: Zup -> When occurring in a sequence, ""zup"" causes the next item in the sequence to correspond to the color yellow, and thus can be thought of as a modifier indicating the next color regardless of the preceding colors or patterns.",-0.09346923345250528,74,zup
"Rule:

Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to act as a signal to change the color in the output sequence. Examining the pattern, the first occurrence of ""zup"" changes the output from a sequence of one color (either green or red) to yellow. In subsequent appearances, ""zup"" continues to alter the output color, maintaining the yellow output or changing it.

Let's break down the examples:

1. dax walm wif walm zup:
- ""dax"", ""walm"", and ""wif"" seem to pertain to green and red.
- After ""zup"", everything turns yellow.

2. zup dax:
- Starts with ""zup"", which results in yellow, followed by ""dax,"" which is green.

3. wif dax zup bluf:
- ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, then ""zup"" changes the output to yellow.
- ""bluf"" does not affect the color change induced by ""zup"" and remains yellow.

4. zup dax wif:
- ""zup"" starts the output with yellow, then ""dax"" is green, and ""wif"" is red.

5. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm:
- ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" follow the red-red-green pattern.
- After ""zup,"" the output becomes yellow.
- ""wif"" now seems to switch to red again.
- ""lug"" changes the color to blue, including the repetition of ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it alters the color output sequence to yellow when it first appears, and it may reset the color sequence (or potentially continue in yellow) afterwards, but it always signifies a change in the color pattern being output.

zup -> signifies a change in output color pattern to yellow upon its first appearance and may reset or continue the color sequence in subsequent appearances.",-0.4491328868946316,74,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples given.

First, it appears the color names in the output are associated with the words preceding them. It seems like each non-zup word is associated with a particular color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> green
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue

When looking at the outputs, we can observe that ""zup"" causes a transition in color. In the first example, after ""zup"" is introduced, the color sequence changes from green to red, and then to yellow. In the following examples, directly after ""zup,"" the color sequence includes yellow.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" marks a change or transition in the sequence of colors and is directly followed by yellow, regardless of the preceding word's associated color. 

The pattern for ""zup"" appears to be: When ""zup"" occurs, the output color is yellow, and after ""zup"" has been used, there is a transition to a new sequence of colors dictated by the words that follow.

Rule: zup -> Yellow and signals a transition in the color sequence.",-1.100536983391579,74,zup
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup,"" let's observe how its outputs change with respect to its position and surrounding words:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""walm"" (first example), it translates to three consecutive ""yellow"" outputs.
2. When ""zup"" follows ""dax"" (second and fourth examples), it produces a single ""yellow"" output.
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" (third example), it again results in a ""yellow"" output followed by ""green"" for ""dax.""
4. When ""zup"" is the last word (fifth example), it produces a single ""yellow"" followed by color outputs for the subsequent words that are not directly associated with ""zup"" (since ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" but it translates to ""red"" on its own and ""lug"" to ""blue"").

From these observations, it seems that ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the words around it. There's no indication that the number of ""yellow"" outputs varies with context in the way that ""walm"" seems to produce three ""green"" outputs (example one) or that ""wif"" might change (always corresponds to ""red"").

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence, with no indication that the number of ""yellow"" outputs it produces varies depending on its position or surrounding words.

zup -> yellow",-1.1945837265705264,74,zup
"Considering the given examples, zup appears to influence the output's color based on its position relative to the other words:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is associated with the color green. The appearance of ""zup"" after two instances of ""walm"" leads to three occurrences of red followed by a yellow, which suggests that ""zup"" might be causing a switch or transition in the color pattern.

2. In the second example, when ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" the output is yellow after green, which indicates ""zup"" maintains a transition effect to yellow.

3. In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by green, then ""dax"" is followed by red, and ""zup"" initiates a change to yellow.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" at the beginning of the sequence transitions immediately to yellow, and then the pattern follows the pre-established associations of the other words.

5. In the fifth example, we see that after ""zup,"" the color transitions to yellow, and then ""lug"" leads to a new color, blue, which had not appeared before ""zup.""

From these observations, we can deduce a rule for what ""zup"" means:

Rule: ""zup"" triggers a transition in the color pattern output. Specifically, it causes the subsequent output to be yellow, regardless of the input word position or the color associated with the word preceding ""zup."" After a ""zup"" output, the sequence continues with the color patterns previously assigned to the other words unless a new word introduces a different color.

Based on the rule deduced from the examples, we can write:

zup -> Triggers a transition to the color yellow in the output sequence.",-1.2090974010736848,74,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when following ""zup"" and to ""blue"" when following ""lug"" or ""wif."" There is not enough information to determine the meaning when following ""dax"" or ""walm,"" but since ""bluf"" does not change output when following itself, we can likely rule out that its meaning depends on the preceding word being ""bluf.""

Therefore:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif"", ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds with repeating the color associated with the word that comes before it. Here is the rule induction:

- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" – thus ""lug"" must be associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"" – so ""zup"" must be associated with the color yellow, with ""walm"" causing a triple repetition.
- ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red"" – ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" with red, and ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat three times (in this case, red because it is immediately before ""walm"").
- The repetition of ""zup wif walm"" provides the same output, further supporting the rule.
- ""dax walm wif"" produces ""green green green red"" – here ""dax"" must be associated with green, ""walm"" causes green to repeat three times, and ""wif"" is associated with red, appearing once after ""walm"".

The consistent pattern is that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to repeat three times. If there is a word after ""walm"", it has its regular color association without repetition. Thus:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" - Here, ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color ""yellow,"" which may be associated with ""zup.""
- ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red"" - In this case, ""walm"" seems to occur after ""wif,"" and since the output is ""red red red"" following the single ""yellow,"" it could indicate that ""walm"" is now causing repetition of ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") thrice while ""zup"" still maintains its single occurrence of ""yellow.""
- The next example is identical to the previous and produces the same result, which supports the consistency of the rule.
- ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red"" - Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" leading to ""green"" being repeated three times, suggesting that ""green"" is associated with ""dax.""

"Based on the examples provided, the word 'walm' appears to control the repetition of a color that is associated with another word in the input. For instance, 'lug' corresponds with 'blue', 'zup' with 'yellow', and 'dax' with 'green'. When 'walm' follows these words, the corresponding color is repeated three times.

In the cases where 'wif' is added to the input before 'walm', it seems to introduce the color 'red' after the repeated colors, as seen in the third and fourth examples. When 'wif' is at the end of the input, as in the fifth example, it again introduces 'red', but this time only once and at the end.

Therefore, we can deduce that 'walm' instructs the repetition of a color associated with the preceding word (three times), and 'wif' introduces the color 'red' either after the repeated color if it precedes 'walm', or once at the end if it follows 'walm'.

Rule: 'walm' -> causes the associated color of the preceding word to be repeated three times. If 'wif' appears before 'walm', 'red' is additionally repeated as many times as 'walm' dictates the repetition of the preceding color.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's look at each input and its corresponding output to identify patterns:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug 
   Output: green green green yellow blue

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

3. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

We're looking for associations between the context around ""walm"" and the colors in the output to establish a rule.

Analyzing these examples, we can observe:

- The first color following ""walm"" in the output repeats the color of the word that precedes it.
- The subsequent colors (after the repeated one) are all red, regardless of the words that follow ""walm.""

The rule appears to be:

- When ""walm"" is presented, the first output color is the same as the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""
- After which, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of red(s).

Now apply this rule to confirm if it holds for each example:

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green"" where green is repeated as the color of ""dax"" (before ""walm""), followed by ""yellow blue"" where ""zup"" equals yellow and ""lug"" equals blue.

2. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue,"" where blue is a repetition of the color of ""lug"" (which precedes the first ""walm""), and the sequence of reds follows for ""wif"" and the second ""walm.""

3. ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again with the repetition of ""yellow"" from ""zup"" (before ""walm""), followed by a red for ""wif"".

4. ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" where blue is the color repeated from ""lug"" (before ""walm""), and it's followed by red for ""wif"".

5. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red,"" with the last ""red red red"" sequence following the pattern where ""walm"" leads to repeated reds after the initial color repetition.

The hypothesized rule seems consistent across the examples.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, output the color corresponding to the preceding word, followed by a series of reds.

Therefore: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word, then continue with red(s).",-0.06705805616721051,75,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided:

Example 1:
- Input: dax walm zup lug
- Output: green green green yellow blue

Example 2:
- Input: zup lug walm wif walm
- Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Example 3:
- Input: zup walm wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Example 4:
- Input: lug walm wif
- Output: blue blue blue red

Example 5:
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
- Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Observing the outputs associated with the instances of the word ""walm"" in the inputs:

- In Example 1, directly after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""green.""
- In Example 2, twice ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif,"" leading to a repetition of the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and then a sequence of ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""
- In Example 3, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the corresponding output contains a repetition of ""yellow.""
- In Example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and similarly, the output shows a repetition of ""blue.""
- In Example 5, the ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and leads to a sequence of three ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated. In case the preceding word is ""wif,"" it results in a sequence of three reds instead of just a repetition.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as follows:

Walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times.",-0.08329921915347367,75,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that comes directly before it in the sequence, with the addition of the color red at the end. To verify, let's observe the patterns:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green"", and ""lug"" which is blue is followed by a yellow unrelated to ""walm"" in the sequence. This suggests walm duplicates the color of the word before it.

- The second example further supports this, as ""walm wif walm"" results in ""blue blue red red red"" with ""wif"" already established as red and ""walm"" repeating the color blue that comes before it initially.

- The third and fourth examples consistently show that ""zup walm wif"" and ""lug walm wif"" convert to a triplicate of the color preceding ""walm"" followed by red, as indicated by the word ""wif"".

- The fifth example, ""wif zup bluf wif walm"" confirms the pattern, where ""walm"" follows a red even though ""wif"" was the color before ""zup"", indicating that ""walm"" only responds to immediate precursors.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" replicates the color of the immediately preceding word, followed by red. If there is no precedent color, the assumption will be that red follows as the output for ""walm"" is not standalone observable. However, all examples have other colors preceding ""walm"", so it is not defined what happens if ""walm"" is the first word without a color context.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the immediately preceding word and adds the color red.",-0.7586750998723156,75,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples given:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the sequence corresponds to ""green green green.""
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and ""lug,"" the corresponding colors are ""yellow blue blue.""
3. Following ""zup,"" ""walm"" is associated with two ""yellow"" colors.
4. Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" is associated with two ""blue"" colors.
5. When ""walm"" is at the end and follows ""wif,"" it corresponds with three ""red"" colors.

Now, breaking it down:

- ""walm"" consistently results in the output of more than one instance of the color that precedes it.
- After ""dax"" (green), we see three greens.
- After ""zup"" (yellow) or ""lug"" (blue), it gives two of the respective color. 
- When it follows ""wif,"" we see three reds, possibly due to the fact that ""wif"" itself corresponds to red based on ""dax wif zup"" example resulting in ""green red yellow"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to multiply the color output that immediately precedes it. If the preceding color is represented once, ""walm"" triples it. If the preceding color is repeated, then ""walm"" doubles the output of the color. 

Thus,

walm -> multiply the preceding color (triple if the color appears once, double if the color appears more than once).",-1.0008546853515787,75,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first analyze the color pattern succession whenever ""walm"" is present:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output colors change from ""green"" for ""dax"" to ""green green green yellow"" with the inclusion of ""walm.""
   
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" changing the output from ""blue"" for ""lug"" to ""blue blue red."" When ""walm"" is repeated again, we see another ""red"" added.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" changing the output from ""yellow"" for ""zup"" to ""yellow yellow yellow red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and again we see the colors change from ""blue"" for ""lug"" to ""blue blue blue red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows a sequence that includes ""wif,"" and we see the pattern ""red red red"" after ""walm,"" akin to the pattern seen in examples 2 to 4 after ""walm.""

Based on the above observations, the following rule for ""walm"" can be inferred:

""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times, and then it ends with the color ""red.""

This yields the following meaning:

walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times followed by red.

3. In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" stands for ""red,"" and ""wif"" seems to not change the output color. ""Walm"" repeats the last color word, which is ""wif"", but since ""wif"" doesn't have a color, it repeats the previous one which is ""red"". Thus, the output is ""yellow yellow red red red.""

4. In ""dax walm wif bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" stands for ""red."" ""Walm"" repeats the color word following it, but since ""wif"" does not have a color, ""walm"" repeats the previous one, ""dax"" or ""green"". Thus, the output is ""green green green red red.""

5. In ""dax zup walm wif walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The first ""walm"" repeats the color word following it, ""wif"", but since ""wif"" doesn't have a color, it repeats the previous one which is ""yellow"". The second ""walm"" repeats the color word following it, ""wif"", but since we've established ""wif"" doesn't have a color, it again uses the last valid color word ""wif"" which corresponds to the last valid color ""yellow"". Thus, the pattern is ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the most recent color, if no color follows it, the color it repeats is the one before it. If the word following ""walm"" has no associated color, it repeats the color preceding this word.",-0.09129054891711112,76,walm
"Based on the given input and output pairs, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be translated to a repeated color in the output, with the number of repetitions and the color itself depending on other words in the input. To determine the specific rule for ""walm,"" let's analyze each example provided.

In each case, the number of times the color repeats in the output corresponds to the number of instances of ""walm"" in the input plus one.

1. lug zup walm lug —> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
2. zup walm —> yellow yellow yellow
3. zup bluf wif walm —> yellow yellow red red red
4. dax walm wif bluf —> green green green red red
5. dax zup walm wif walm —> green yellow yellow yellow red red red

The repetitions occur immediately following the ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the next color word to repeat. Also, we see that the number of repetitions of the color corresponds to the number of ""walm"" occurrences plus one.

From example 1:
- ""lug zup walm lug"" leads to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is repeated after ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the next color three times.""

From examples 2 and 3:
- These examples further confirm that ""walm"" causes the following color to repeat, with the total number of colors being ""number of 'walm' in the input plus one.""

From example 4:
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" at the end of the sequence, indicating that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green."" ""dax walm"" then gives ""green green green,"" which is ""green"" repeated three times, falling in line with the established rule.

From example 5:
- The input ""dax zup walm wif walm"" involves two instances of ""walm,"" and we see that after each ""walm,"" the next color word is repeated three times (since there are two ""walm,"" we expect two sets of three repetitions).
- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" following ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""wif walm"" at the end of the input results in ""red red red,"" confirming again that ""walm"" causes the following color word to repeat three times.

Rule:
walm -> repeat the subsequent color word three times.",-0.09157194990682221,76,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to represent a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Let's examine each example:

1. In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"". Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of ""zup"" which is yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow"" before the final ""lug"" outputs ""blue"".

2. In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed immediately by ""walm"", which results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here ""walm"" repeats the color yellow twice.

3. In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""bluf"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which was also red, leading to ""red red red"". Again, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"", which is red.

4. In ""dax walm wif bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""walm"" repeats this color, leading to ""green green green"", and then ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

5. In ""dax zup walm wif walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""walm"" follows. Given that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, it leads to ""yellow yellow"". ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" would repeat this red color, resulting in ""red red red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word the same number of times as there are letters in the word ""walm"". Since ""walm"" has four letters, repeat the preceding color four times.",-0.3305691981006667,76,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it looks like the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that the previous word represents. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color of the word that came before ""walm"" is repeated additional times. Here is the rule based on the examples:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color red as well.

Using those translations, we see that the word ""walm"" repeats the previous color in the sequence. For example:

- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" translates to yellow and then ""walm"" repeats yellow, followed by ""lug"" which translates to blue.

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" repeats yellow twice more.

- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" is red, ""wif"" is also red, and ""walm"" repeats the color red two more times.

- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" repeats green, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are red.

- In ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow twice, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats red twice.

Therefore, the rule induced from the examples for the nonce word ""walm"" is:

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", let's analyze the outputs associated with its presence and the contexts where it alters the sequence of colors in the outputs.

1. When looking at examples 1, 4, and 5, one pattern that emerges is that ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"" in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" itself could translate directly to ""green"".
   
2. In example 2, ""dax lug"" outputs ""green blue"", and in example 3, ""dax bluf wif"" outputs ""green green red"". The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". ""Dax"" precedes ""green"" both times, reinforcing the direct translation rule.

3. In example 1, ""dax"" occurs after ""wif walm"" which both translate to ""red red"", and it still results in a ""green"" output. So, ""dax"" does not seem to depend on the words immediately before it to translate to ""green"".

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be independent of context—the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided. 

Rule: dax -> green",-0.9811324181563225,77,dax
"To decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can analyze the instances where it appears and the associated output:

1. The sequence ""wif walm dax"" consistently leads to the output ""red red red green,"" with ""green"" always following ""dax."" 
2. When ""dax"" appears at the beginning, as in ""dax lug"" or ""dax bluf wif,"" it leads to ""green"" followed by colors that correspond to the following words.
3. In the sequence ""lug walm dax,"" ""dax"" follows two ""blue"" outputs and is itself followed by a ""green"" output.

By inspecting these patterns, we can infer the following rule:
- The presence of ""dax"" consistently leads to the color ""green"" in the output.

So we can write the rule as:

Rule: dax -> green",-1.0566098380957476,77,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color. We can see which color each word corresponds to by looking at patterns within each example. After analyzing the input-output pairs, we can deduce the following correlations:

- wif -> red
- walm -> blue
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green (since it consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output)

Therefore, the rule that can be derived from the given examples is:

Rule: dax -> green",-1.2094519142229878,77,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word 'dax' seems to be associated with the color green. Each time 'dax' appears in the input, the output includes the color green at the position corresponding to 'dax'. No other context is provided to suggest any additional meaning or rules associated with the nonce word 'dax'. Here is the correlation:

- In input 1, 'dax' corresponds to the first green in the output.
- In input 2, 'dax' alone leads to a green in the output.
- In input 3, 'dax' at the beginning leads to a green in the output.
- In input 4, 'dax' at the end leads to a green at the end of the output.
- In input 5, 'dax' again leads to a green in the output.

Given this information, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",-1.72667953942069,77,dax
"To figure out the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the patterns.

In each example, the appearance of ""dax"" leads to the output ""green."" Given this consistent association, irrespective of the words that come before or after ""dax,"" I can deduce that ""dax"" is associated with the color green. No other word in the inputs systematically produces the output ""green.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",-1.8045188347747134,77,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the correlation between the inputs containing the word ""wif"" and their respective outputs:

1. ""wif zup"" correlates with ""red yellow.""
   This suggests that ""wif"" may correspond to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

2. ""lug wif walm"" correlates with ""blue red red red.""
   Since ""walm"" appears once in the input but is represented three times in the output (""red red red""), we can infer that ""wif"" likely represents the color ""red"" and is not related to the number of times ""red"" is repeated in the output.

3. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" correlates with ""blue red green green green yellow.""
   Given that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" and ""walm"" to ""green"" (repeated since both are present), and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" it again confirms that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" correlates with ""yellow yellow red green red yellow.""
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" yet again suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. ""zup wif"" correlates with ""yellow red.""

5. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
   - ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf,"" similar to the previous examples, again corresponds to ""green.""

2. When ""bluf"" appears alone after other words (not just ""zup""), the output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color directly preceding it.
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" its output is ""blue,"" which is the output for ""lug.""

Let us examine the inputs and outputs in detail:

- In the first and third examples, ""bluf"" comes right after ""zup,"" and the output for both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is sandwiched between two ""wif."" The output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red,"" matching the color output for the word directly before it.

Here, ""lug"" leads to the color ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" takes the color ""blue"" right after it.

Input: wif lug dax walm

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

Input: wif walm lug bluf

Rule: walm -> assumes the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.",-0.07443466575704759,77,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let us look at the relationship between the inputs and the outputs.

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Analyzing the patterns in which ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output colors, we can make some observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output color before it matches the color that follows it.
- ""Walm"" is immediately preceded by a color-word (lug, wif, zup, dax), which determines the color (blue, red, yellow, green respectively).
- The color that ""walm"" outputs is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it.

From these observations, we can construe the meaning of ""walm"":

- ""Walm"" causes the next color to repeat the color of the word that comes just before ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".",-0.07496532830344049,77,walm
"Following the pattern in the examples given, we can deduce the meaning of walm with respect to its position in relation to other words and their corresponding colors:

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
3. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
4. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
5. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue

In these examples, walm tends to replicate the color of the word before it, except in cases where there is no preceding word or the word ""wif"" precedes it, which results in the color red. This outcome is observed in these instances:
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the color blue is repeated.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the color green is repeated.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", or it is the first word, the output for walm is red.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that walm takes the color of the word before it unless wif is directly before walm, or none is before it, in which case walm is red.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the previous word; if preceded by ""wif"" or no word at all, it becomes red.",-0.09058651378057136,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the given input and their corresponding outputs:

Example 1:
Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Example 2:
Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

Example 3:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Example 4:
Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

Example 5:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Looking at these examples, every output color sequence that follows the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"":

Example 1: ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" lug -> blue, thus the sequence after walm is ""blue blue.""
Example 2: ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" dax -> green, thus the sequence after walm is ""green green green.""
Example 3: ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" lug -> blue, thus the sequence after walm is ""blue blue.""
Example 4: ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" dax -> green, thus the sequence after walm is ""green green green.""
Example 5: ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" wif -> red, thus the sequence after walm is ""red red.""

The rule seems to involve repetition of the color that comes before ""walm"" an equivalent number of times as there are to its immediate right, possibly including ""walm"" itself. However, there is an inconsistency, as Example 2's output sequence after ""walm"" is three greens regardless of ""walm"" being at the end. Additionally, Example 1's sequence has an extra ""yellow red"" at the end even though ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" which should yield red.

If we correct the assumption that ""walm"" itself is not counted, and it merely indicates that whatever word comes before it should have its corresponding color repeated for the number of times equal to the total number of words following ""walm"":

In Example 2, ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" indicates that ""green"" should be repeated twice after ""walm.""
In Example 5, ""wif"" -> red, ""walm"" indicates that ""red"" should be repeated twice, with ""bluf"" as blue, following the pattern.

However, the extra ""yellow red"" at the end of Example 1 does not fit this pattern. So, the rule seems to contain exceptions or additional complexity that isn't revealed in the provided examples.

Based on these observations, the best inference we can make given the inconsistencies is:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it, for the number of times equal to the number of words that come after ""walm"" in the sequence (excluding ""walm"" itself), with some exceptions or additional rules that are not apparent in the examples provided.

Example:
walm -> repeats the preceding color per subsequent word.",-0.10193784526352376,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the outputs in relation to their inputs, comparing them to find a pattern:

1. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
2. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
3. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
4. ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green""
5. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""

Looking at these examples, it seems that the color outputted after ""walm"" matches the following word's output in the sequence, except for when ""walm"" is the last word. When ""walm"" comes at the end of an input sequence, the color outputted is ""green,"" which is the output for the word ""dax"" seen in other sequences.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat its color output, and if ""walm"" is the last word, the output is green (the color associated with ""dax"").

Applying this rule, let's write the meaning of ""walm"":

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" correlates to the color of the word that follows it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last word, it takes the color of the word that preceded it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to blue in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" takes on the color blue.
- In the second example, there is no word after ""bluf,"" so it takes on the color of the previous word, ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to red in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" takes on the color red.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is the last word, so it takes the color of the previous word, ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow; however, because ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and its output is green, the rule might be adjusted to say that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately following it even if the sequence is repeated.

"To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the patterns of input and corresponding output:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""

First, let's note that repetitions of ""walm"" result in repetitions of the last color provided before ""walm"". Here are the observations:

- In example 1, ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue,"" and the presence of ""walm"" right after it results in the repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- In examples 2 and 3, which are identical, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"" three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" thus resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times. ""Wif"" comes after ""walm"" and translates to ""red,"" while ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and appears twice at the beginning, followed by ""bluf dax bluf,"" which translates to ""green green red."" The word ""walm"" comes after another ""wif,"" so it should result in ""red"" being repeated. However, only one ""red"" follows, which is puzzling because we might have expected it to follow the same repeating pattern. But then, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is followed by another ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

The pattern is not clear in Example 5, as ""walm"" should have been followed by a repetition of ""red"" but is not, leading to some inconsistency.

Given the evidence, it seems that ""walm"" might indicate the repetition of the color word appearing immediately before it. The number of times the color is repeated might depend on specific rules not provided in the examples.

However, there is an inconsistency in the provided examples regarding the rule about ""walm,"" especially with example 5, which does not follow the repeating pattern established by the other examples. If we overlook example 5 or assume there may be a misprint, and relying solely on the other examples, the most likely rule is: 

Rule: walm causes the previous color word to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the meaning is:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",-0.09488281840388298,78,walm
"To determine the meaning of walm, we should look at the consistent patterns in the examples provided. Here is a breakdown:

Example 1: lug walm -> blue blue blue
Example 2: zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
Example 3: zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
Example 4: zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
Example 5: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red

Analyzing the inputs and outputs, it appears that individual words correspond to colors:
- lug seems to correspond to blue since ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"", and ""lug"" in the fourth input precedes a sequence of blue.
- zup seems to correspond to yellow.
- wif seems to correspond to red.
- dax seems to correspond to green.
- bluf also seems correspond to green (as seen in the fifth example).

Comparing the inputs with the outputs, it's clear that ""walm"" does not correspond to a single color, but rather to a repetition of the preceding color word's output. For example:
- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- In the second and third examples, ""wif walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" is the sequence and ""blue"" is repeated four times.

Based on this analysis:

Rule: walm replicates the color output associated with the preceding word several times, the number of repetitions equal to the number of color outputs directly following ""walm"" in the sequence.

Thus, walm seems to mean ""repeat the previous color word's output"".",-0.14311511042957442,78,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it generates the word ""red"" repeated a number of times depending on a specific context:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". The word ""lug"" alone appears to translate to one instance of ""blue,"" so when paired with ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in the word ""blue"" being repeated two more times, making a total of three.
- In the second and third examples, ""zup wif walm"" consistently outputs ""yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" the extra ""red red"" seems to be the result of including ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red green,"" which suggests that the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" again causes ""blue"" to be repeated, followed by the usual translations of ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- In the last example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Breaking this down, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" and before another ""lug"" seems to add additional instances of ""red"" before it, considering there is no direct translation for ""bluf.""

Taking these examples into account, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the word directly before it to be repeated. However, the last example also hints at the possibility that ""walm"" adds extra instances of ""red"" specifically, regardless of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" follows a word and causes the color represented by that word to be repeated in the output. If the preceding word translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" appears to add additional instances of ""red"" before it, but the rule cannot be conclusively determined without further examples, particularly instances where ""walm"" is not preceded by ""wif.""",-0.21475227067212785,78,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""walm"" corresponds to a series of a particular color repeated multiple times. To deduce the specific rule that governs the color and the number of repetitions, let's analyze the patterns.

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of the color blue.

2. ""zup wif walm"" is outputting ""yellow red red red"" - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of the color red following ""wif"".

3. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" leads to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"" - In this sequence, ""walm"" is again followed by three repetitions of the color blue coming after ""lug"", and colors following their respective words ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green.

4. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" produces ""red red green green red red red blue red"" - Here, ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in three repetitions of red, though there's possibly a mistake since according to previous examples, ""lug walm"" should yield three blues. However, since ""walm"" appears at the end of the scenario after considering other colors, this may suggest that ""walm"" is affected by the preceding color mentions. 

There are a couple of plausible interpretations, but it seems most likely based on the provided information that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: ""walm"" -> the meaning is the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

"The presence of the word ""walm"" in the input seems to correlate with multiple repetitions of a color in the output.

For each appearance of the word ""walm"" in the input, the output is the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" repeated three times.

Example Analysis:

1. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" here, following a ""bluf"" (""blue"") and preceding another ""bluf"".

2. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" here, following ""walm"" (""blue"").

4. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it is at the start.

5. ""zup lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue yellow red green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end, following a ""wif"" (""red"").

From the analysis, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the words that come before or after it.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.0643392863356293,79,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns associated with it in the various input-output pairs:

1. Since the input ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red blue red,"" and we can see that ""bluf"" is tied to the color ""red"" except when it immediately follows ""dax,"" we might initially hypothesize that ""dax"" causes the next word to change color.

2. The input ""lug walm dax"" turning into ""blue blue blue green"" reinforces this idea because ""dax"" comes at the end and the next word turns green, which could imply that ""dax"" changes the color of the next object in the sequence. 

3. However, the third input ""dax wif zup dax"" contradicts this hypothesis because ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" which should have turned into blue according to our previous rule, but the output is instead ""green."" This means ""dax"" does not change the color of the following word.

4. In the input ""dax zup lug bluf,"" we observe that ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" which still translates to ""yellow."" Additionally, ""lug"" and ""bluf"" both appear after ""dax"" as blue. This shows us that ""dax"" isn't altering the color of the words after it based on this case.

5. Finally, in ""zup lug zup wif dax,"" the output ""yellow blue yellow red green"" shows that the occurrence of ""dax"" at the end of the sequence is related to the color green.

From these examples, we can see a consistent pattern: whenever ""dax"" appears, it correlates to the color green in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence, and it does not seem to affect the color associated with the subsequent words.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.3410986493159698,79,dax

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and try to correlate occurrences of ""walm"" with the patterns in the output.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

In both of these examples, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of ""red,"" but the number of reds that follow ""walm"" does not change when we add or remove other words.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Here, adding ""dax"" to the sequence introduces ""green,"" which comes after the sequence of reds. Notably, ""walm"" still corresponds to three reds.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

This example is particularly revealing. ""Dax"" is leading to ""green,"" and ""walm"" also results in green. It appears that ""walm"" may be taking on the color value of the word preceding it.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which has the output color ""blue."" The output for ""walm"" in this instance is three ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the given examples:

1. When ""lug wif walm"" is the input, the output is ""blue red red red."" 
2. When ""wif walm zup"" is the output, the output is ""red red red yellow."" 
3. When ""wif walm dax zup"" is the input, the output is ""red red red green yellow.""
4. When ""dax walm"" is the input, the output is ""green green green.""
5. When ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" is the input, the output is ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue.""

From the examples, we can observe that ""walm"" appears to ensure that the next three outputs are identical and are repeated versions of the output connected to the word immediately prior to ""walm.""

1. In ""lug wif walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""walm,"" there are three ""red"" outputs, which is the same as the output for ""wif.""
2. In ""wif walm zup,"" the word ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and the next three outputs after ""walm"" are ""red.""
3. In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and ""dax"" outputs ""green."" After ""walm,"" there are three ""red"" outputs before the pattern continues with ""green"" for ""dax.""
4. In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" there are three ""green"" outputs.
5. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" there are three ""blue"" outputs.

Based on this consistent pattern, we can deduce the function of ""walm"" in this context.

Therefore:

- In example 2 (""wif walm zup""), ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"" three times, followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In example 3 (""wif walm dax zup""), we again see ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" three times, followed by ""dax"" which is ""green"" and ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".
- In example 4 (""dax walm""), ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.
- In example 5 (""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug""), we have ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" causes the preceding ""blue"" to be repeated three more times followed by ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""lug"" as ""blue"" again.

- Every output associated with the input ""walm"" produces a set of three identical colors.
- The color that is outputted three times seems to depend on the word that is immediately before ""walm.""

Now, let's match the words before ""walm"" with their corresponding color outputs:

- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"" (The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and the color red is repeated three times.)
- ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow"" (Same as above; ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" resulting in three reds.)
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated three times.)
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"" (The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" and we get three blue colors in sequence following ""walm."")

3. Input: zup bluf dax lug

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green."" The presence of ""dax"" in each input sequence leads to the ""green"" appearing in the output sequence one or more times. Additionally, it seems that the other context words around ""dax"" may determine how many times ""green"" appears or the sequence in which it appears. Here is a breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red."" It seems that ""dax"" causes the output of three ""green,"" followed by the translation of ""wif"" to ""red,"" which is also outputted three times due to the repetition of ""walm."" The repetition of ""walm"" does not seem to directly relate to the output color, but it could imply a repetition pattern or emphasis.

2. In the second example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" produces ""green green green red blue green green green."" Here, ""dax"" once again precedes a threefold appearance of ""green,"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The second occurrence of ""dax"" leads to another three greens, reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" is associated with three ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" correlates with ""yellow yellow green blue."" Here ""dax"" produces a single ""green,"" and ""lug"" comes after ""dax,"" resulting in a ""blue."" It does not have the threefold ""green"" effect here, which suggests that the number of ""greens"" produced by ""dax"" may depend on its position or surrounding context.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green."" Here ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is three ""green."" This aligns with the previous examples in which ""dax"" precedes ""walm.""

5. In the final example, ""dax lug wif"" results in ""green blue red."" With ""dax"" coming first, it outputs ""green,"" followed by ""lug"" with ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" 

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule might be that ""dax"" is correlated with the color ""green"" and often precedes multiple ""green"" outputs. However, the specific number of greens appears to be influenced by the surrounding context terms such as ""walm"" or ""lug.""

Rule: Dax -> when following or followed by ""walm"" and not preceded by another keyword, outputs triple ""green"". In other instances, it correlates to a single ""green.""",-0.0771296042119355,80,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns.

In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm wif walm,"" which results in ""green green green red red red."" Notice that ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" and because ""wif"" appears after two instances of ""walm,"" it seems to switch the output color to ""red."" 

In the second example, ""dax"" is used twice, and each time it is followed by different words. However, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and once again corresponds to ""green."" The sequence ""walm wif lug"" gives ""green red blue."" Since ""wif"" follows a ""walm,"" it gives ""red,"" and ""lug"" is producing ""blue."" When ""lug"" directly follows ""dax,"" it results in ""green blue,"" indicating that ""dax"" affects the color after it. 

The third example introduces ""zup bluf dax lug,"" which gives ""yellow yellow green blue."" The new word ""zup"" and ""bluf"" produce ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" after ""dax"" produces ""blue,"" like in the previous example. 

The fourth example has ""lug zup dax walm,"" with the output ""blue yellow green green green."" Here, ""lug"" at the beginning gives ""blue,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" gives a sequence of greens. 

In the fifth example, ""dax lug wif"" correlates to ""green blue red."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" and unlike when ""lug"" started the sequence, it causes a ""green"" output, indicating that the ""dax"" changes the color output of the following word.

What is notable is that the word after ""dax"" seems to determine the color that follows. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" a string of ""green"" is produced until a different word appears. ""dax"" followed by ""lug"" results in a lone ""green,"" then whatever color ""lug"" normally produces.

From the examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" acts as a color reset or initializer to ""green"" for a sequence or single word that follows. After ""dax,"" ""walm"" generates a sequence of ""green"" until another word occurs, ""lug"" results in a single ""green,"" and other non-defined words after ""dax"" have not been observed in the examples provided.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
dax -> Resets or initializes the next word or sequence of identical words to the color ""green.""",-0.32366120567702145,80,dax
"Based on the given examples, each time the nonce word ""dax"" appears, the output begins with ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color green. However, its role seems to extend beyond simply being tied to the color, as the subsequent colors change depending on what follows ""dax.""

To determine the complete set of rules for ""dax,"" we need to examine its relationship to other words and their corresponding colors. Observing the input and output sequences, here are the rules that can be induced:

1. When ""dax"" appears before ""walm,"" it results in a sequence of ""green green green.""
2. When ""dax"" appears before ""lug,"" it results in ""green blue.""
3. When ""dax"" appears before a sequence that includes ""wif,"" it changes the color after it to red.
4. In the third sequence, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output sequence is followed by ""blue,"" which indicates that ""dax"" does not change the word following it if it is not ""walm"" or ""wif.""

These observations can lead us to infer the following:

- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" with an additional rule.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the next two instances are also ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the next instance is ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" it changes the color designation of ""wif"" to ""red.""

Combining these deductions, we can state the rule as:

Every time ""zup"" occurs, the word that directly follows gives us the output ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is at the end of the sequence, it is still followed by ""yellow.""

Hence, it seems that ""zup"" causes the next word (or its equivalent output) to be translated as ""yellow,"" regardless of what that next word is. If there is no word following ""zup,"" or it is the last in the sequence, its corresponding output remains ""yellow.""

- Input: dax lug walm 
- Output: green blue blue blue

Example 2:
- Input: zup walm dax lug
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Example 3:
- Input: zup lug walm wif dax
- Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Example 4:
- Input: wif lug dax walm
- Output: red blue green green green

Example 5:
- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
- Output: yellow green green green yellow red

It seems like none of the other words (lug, zup, dax, wif) correlate with multiple identical colors in output, with the exception of when ""walm"" is included in the input which then leads to a repetition of the color preceding it three times. So, from the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color word that comes directly before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word directly before ""walm"" three times.",-0.08673588570875271,80,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns of inputs and outputs related to its use. One clear pattern is that the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input results in a repetition of the color word that immediately follows it in the output.

Let's go through the examples one by one:

1. Input: ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue""
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and then ""blue"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: ""zup walm dax lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" and then ""yellow"" is repeated three times before the sequence continues.

3. Input: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and then ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. Input: ""wif lug dax walm"" -> Output: ""red blue green green green""
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and then ""green"" is repeated three times.

5. Input: ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green yellow red""
In this example, ""walm"" is following ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and then ""green"" is repeated three times.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Causes the color word that follows the word it is associated with in the input to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.10601934151010753,80,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the relationship between the input and the output in the given examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
2. Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
4. Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif -> Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Looking at these, we can attempt to identify a pattern for ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" is following ""lug,"" and in the output, there is a repetition of ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax lug,"" with the output showing a repetition of ""yellow"" before transitioning to the colors for the rest of the sequence.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again with the output repeating ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" comes at the end, after ""dax,"" and the output ends with repeated ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup,"" and the output shows repeated ""green"" after the ""green"" for ""dax.""

Given these examples, ""walm"" appears to cause the color of the word that comes after it to be repeated three times in a row in the output, except for the last example where the repetition is only seen twice due to the presence of another color after it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by another nonce word, the output color for that word is repeated three times, unless another nonce word directly follows, in which case the repeat count may vary (as seen in the last example).

Based on this, we can define:

walm -> Causes the next color word in the sequence to repeat multiple times.",-0.11030578247145162,80,walm
"Walm -> ""green"" repeated one time less than the number of words following it in the input sequence.

Rule:
Observe that each time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, a certain number of ""green"" words follow in the output sequence. The quantity of ""green"" words correlates with the number of words following ""walm""—there is always one fewer ""green"" word than the count of subsequent words in the input.

For example:
- In ""dax lug walm,"" there is no word after ""walm,"" and hence, no ""green"" in the output.
- In ""zup walm dax lug,"" there are two words after ""walm,"" thus two ""green"" in the output.
- In ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" there are two words after ""walm,"" and accordingly, there are two ""green"" in the output.
- In ""wif lug dax walm,"" there is one word after ""walm,"" hence one ""green"" in the output.
- In ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" there are two words after ""walm,"" which results in two ""green"" in the output.",-0.698561671758817,80,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- Other words like ""dax"", ""wif"", ""walm"", and ""bluf"" are each associated with a unique color—green, red, and blue, respectively.
- The presence of ""lug"" in a sequence does not affect the color associated with other words, as seen in the example ""lug walm wif lug"".

However, there are other words that seem to determine the number of times ""yellow"" is outputted in relation to other colours (""dax"" for green and ""wif"" for red) and potentially their ordering. Here's how it appears to work:

- ""zup"" on its own results in a single ""yellow"".
- When preceded by ""walm"", the word ""zup"" is outputted in triplicate, as indicated by ""walm zup walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"". 
- The number of occurrences of the preceding color word (e.g., ""dax"" for green or ""wif"" for red), determines the number of times that color word is outputted in triplicate before ""zup"" output starts.

So the general rule we can derive based on these observations is:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". When flanked by ""walm"", output ""yellow"" three times. Other colors represented by words such as ""dax"" (green) or ""wif"" (red) that precede ""zup"" are also outputted as triplets before the yellow sequence.

- When ""zup"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output after ""zup"" contains three ""yellow.""

It seems that ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow,"" and the context in which ""zup"" is used affects the number of times colors are repeated in the output.

However, there isn't enough consistent context to determine a solid rule for the repetition of colors or the occurrences of other colors like ""green"" or ""red."" The word that precedes ""zup"" (e.g., ""dax,"" ""wif"") affects the color that appears before yellow, but we don't have enough examples to definitively determine the pattern for that part of the output.

The most consistent rule that we can deduce from the given examples is that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

- After ""walm"" the color yellow is repeated three times.

5. Input: dax lug walm Output: green blue blue blue
- After ""walm"" the color blue is repeated three times.

Walm seems to influence the output such that the color corresponding to the word immediately following ""walm"" is repeated exactly three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word three times.",-0.1113923466031183,84,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, we notice the following patterns:

- In each instance where ""walm"" appears, the corresponding output color is repeated multiple times consecutively.
- The color that is repeated correlates to the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"".
- The number of repetitions seems to be three, regardless of the position or context of ""walm"".

From the examples given:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
   ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and it is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""red” being repeated three times.

2. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   The second word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the next three colors are ""yellow.""

3. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
   ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" we get ""green"" repeated three times.

4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

From this analysis, we can induce the rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: walm causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times.

Therefore:
walm -> The color of the prior word is repeated three consecutive times.",-0.12013664083193552,84,walm
"Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow
4. Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue

Looking at the inputs and outputs together, we can derive the following:

- ""zup"" correlates with the word ""yellow""
- ""wif"" correlates with the word ""red""
- ""dax"" correlates with the word ""green""
- ""lug"" correlates with the word ""blue""

Now to figure out the meaning of ""walm"", we examine instances of where it appears:

1. The first example implies that ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in a sequence of ""red red red"".
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax"", and the result is ""yellow yellow yellow green"", which suggests that ""walm"" might be repeating the color before it.
3. The third example has ""walm"" at the end of the sequence after ""dax"", which yields ""green green green"", reinforcing the repetition rule.
4. The fourth and fifth examples further support this idea, as ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug"" and the resulting colors are ""yellow yellow yellow"" and ""blue blue blue"" respectively.

From this analysis, we can determine the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color word that comes immediately before ""walm"" three times.",-0.15036923396301075,84,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with repetitive color outputs. Observing the instances, whenever ""walm"" appears, the color immediately before ""walm"" is repeated.

For example:
- In 'zup wif walm', ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm,"" we see ""red red red.""
- In 'lug wif dax walm zup', ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm"" is ""green green.""
- In 'lug zup walm lug', ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow.""
- In 'dax lug walm', ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color immediately before it to repeat three more times. If that color was already the output color prior to ""walm"" appearing and being followed by a different word, then it results in two additional repetitions instead (as noted in the third and fourth examples where ""green"" and ""yellow"" are repeated twice after ""walm"" instead of three times).

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" indicates that the color immediately before ""walm"" should be repeated three times in the output.

- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"".

3. Input: wif walm

4. ""dax wif"" maps to ""green red"" — Similar to the first example, ""wif"" results in ""red.""
5. ""wif"" on its own maps to ""red"" — Here, ""wif"" alone is generating ""red.""

Given these observations, it appears that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.",-0.09464388773299998,85,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to translate to the color ""red."" Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. However, there seems to be an additional rule impacting the output based on the word preceding ""wif.""

Here are the observations broken down:

1. When ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output starts with ""yellow,"" followed by ""red.""
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" and ""lug"" is also present after ""wif,"" the output consists of repeating the color ""blue,"" followed by ""red,"" and then continues with ""blue."" The number of ""blue"" before ""red"" corresponds to the number of ""lug"" before ""wif.""
3. When ""wif"" is preceded by ""walm,"" the output is triple ""red.""
4. When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" followed by ""red.""
5. When ""wif"" stands alone, the output is simply ""red.""

The consistent part is that ""wif"" results in ""red."" However, the word preceding ""wif"" seems to determine an additional color output that occurs before the ""red."" Each of these words might correspond to a specific color:

- ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" makes ""red"" repeat three times, possibly indicating intensity or emphasis.
- ""dax"" might correspond to ""green.""

Hence, the rule could be interpreted as such:

Rule:
1. ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
2. The word immediately preceding ""wif"" determines an additional color that is outputted before ""red.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs. Specifically, we should consider the position and repetition of ""zup"" and analyze how it affects the sequence of colors in the output.

Looking at the first example:
Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Considering ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" we can deduce:
- ""zup"" at the start of the sequence translates to ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" following ""lug"" (blue) translates again to ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

In the second example:
Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

Given that ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow"" respectively, we see that:
- ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow"" at the start and after ""lug.""

In the third example:
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Here, ""zup"" comes before ""wif"" (red) and translates to ""yellow.""

In the fourth example:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Here, ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and is followed by another ""yellow.""

Finally, in the fifth example:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

We have ""wif"" (red) followed by ""walm,"" which seems to repeat the preceding color (""red""). After that, we see ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow,"" whether it comes before ""lug"" (blue) or ""walm.""

From these examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" despite the context or other words around it. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.05179917528630207,85,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's analyze the instances of its use in the given examples and the corresponding outputs.

1. Every time ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output:
    - ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow""
    - ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red""
    - ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
    - ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
    - ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
    
   From the above, we can see that ""zup"" only appears adjacent to ""yellow"" in the output, suggesting an association.

2. When ""zup"" follows another word, it replaces it with ""yellow"":
    - After ""lug"", we get ""blue yellow blue"", replacing the first ""lug"" with ""yellow"".
    - After ""wif"", we get ""red yellow red"", replacing the ""wif"" with ""yellow"".
    - After ""dax"", we get ""green yellow yellow"", replacing the first ""dax"" with ""yellow"". However, there's an additional ""yellow"" which we will address in the next point.
    - After ""walm"", we get ""red red red yellow blue yellow"", replacing the first ""walm"" with ""yellow"", followed by adding additional ""yellow"" as seen in the pattern established in example 4.

3. ""Zup"" also appears to duplicate the color preceding it, especially noticeable when no other word is between the ""zup"" and the color to duplicate:
    - ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"" (no duplication as no color precedes ""zup"").
    - ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (seems to duplicate the ""yellow"" that replaced ""dax"").
    - ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" (the second ""zup"" duplicates ""yellow"" after replacing ""lug"").
    
For this kind of repetitive and replacement pattern, the most consistent rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it translates to ""yellow"" and also causes the preceding color word to be duplicated in the output sequence.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and duplicates the color word that precedes it in the input sequence. If no color word precedes it (like when ""zup"" is at the beginning), then it is simply translated as ""yellow"".",-0.09920206980684376,85,zup
"The examples suggest that ""zup"" immediately affects the color that follows it, but not colors that precede it. Looking closely at each instance where ""zup"" appears:

- Whenever ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue.""
- Whenever ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is either ""yellow yellow"" or, if it is a double ""zup,"" it becomes ""yellow blue yellow yellow.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" results in ""yellow red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" isn't affected by what precedes it.
- In the last example, ""zup"" affects the colors that follow it, and ""lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""

From this, we can infer that ""zup"" modifies the color word that follows it to ""yellow."" It does not seem to be affected by the words that come before it. Therefore, the rule here is that regardless of the preceding color, ""zup"" changes the following color word to ""yellow."" However, ""zup"" does not take effect if it is the last word in the sequence, which suggests that it only modifies the following word.

Rule: zup -> changes the next color word to yellow.",-0.8755346270428129,85,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we need to look at its pattern of occurrence and how it translates into the outputs in each example. 

Here are the observations:
- In every instance, ""zup"" appears to consistently translate to ""yellow.""
- The word ""zup"" does not seem to modify the meaning of the words that come before or after it.
- Words that are not ""zup,"" like ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax,"" correspond to different colors.
- The word ""zup"" does not occur by itself without translating into ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-1.763946855419791,85,zup
"From the examples provided, each 'Input' and corresponding 'Output' seems to represent a pattern where each nonce word maps to a certain color.

Let's analyze each input and its output sequentially to deduce the rule:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   Here bluf is associated with red.

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Here again, the position where 'bluf' appears corresponds to red.

3. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   Once more, bluf corresponds to red.

4. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   In this case, bluf translates to green which seems inconsistent with previous examples unless wif has an influence on the meaning of the following word.

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   In this case, directly following 'dax', 'bluf' translates to green, which is consistent with the example 4 but not with the examples 1-3.

Let's hypothesize that 'bluf' means red unless it directly follows 'dax', in which case it means green. Now we'll revisit each example to see if this hypothesis holds:

1. In ""wif bluf dax"" bluf is not directly following dax, so it translates to red.
2. In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", bluf does not follow dax, so it translates to red.
3. In ""dax lug wif bluf"", even though dax appears before bluf, they are not consecutive, so bluf still translates to red.
4. In ""wif dax bluf"", bluf directly follows dax, so it translates to green.
5. In ""dax bluf"", bluf directly follows dax, so it translates to green.

Thus, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: Bluf translates to red unless it is directly preceded by the word ""dax"", in which case it translates to green.",-0.08874787462841024,85,bluf
"Examining the input and output examples, one can attempt to derive a rule for what ""bluf"" represents:

3. Input: dax lug wif bluf -> Output: green blue red red
4. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
5. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green

From these examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence. For instance, in example 1, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which outputs as ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red."" This pattern holds true for the rest of the examples. The rule for ""bluf,"" therefore, seems to be that it takes on the same output as the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> The same output (color) as the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.",-0.10156472368910253,85,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
3. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
4. wif dax bluf -> red green green
5. dax bluf -> green green

First, let's look for patterns that occur consistently with ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" is present, the word immediately before ""bluf"" has its color repeated in the output.
- ""bluf"" never generates a unique color. It rather seems to denote repetition.

Now, let's verify by comparing ""bluf"" with words before and after it:

1. In the first input, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" After ""bluf,"" we have ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" The output for ""bluf"" in this case is ""red,"" which is a repetition of the color before it.
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is again ""blue,"" repeating the color before it.
3. The third and fourth inputs behave similarly, where the color before ""bluf"" is repeated for ""bluf.""
4. Even when ""bluf"" is the last word, as in the fifth input, the color is still repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> causes the preceding color to be repeated in the output.",-0.10842177131641023,85,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the input and output pairs provided:

- When ""wif bluf dax"" is input, the output is ""red red green.""
- When ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue.""
- When ""dax lug wif bluf"" is input, the output is ""green blue red red.""
- When ""wif dax bluf"" is input, the output is ""red green green.""
- When ""dax bluf"" is input, the output is ""green green.""

Based on the examples provided, we can try to pinpoint what ""bluf"" corresponds to in each output. By observing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we notice a pattern: whenever ""bluf"" is present, a color is repeated immediately after the color that corresponds to the word right before ""bluf.""

Let's see how this applies to each example:
1. ""wif bluf dax"" becomes ""red red green"" — ""red"" repeats.
2. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" — here ""blue"" repeats right after ""bluf,"" and ""red"" before ""bluf"" does not interfere with the sequence.
3. ""dax lug wif bluf"" becomes ""green blue red red"" — ""red"" repeats.
4. ""wif dax bluf"" becomes ""red green green"" — ""green"" repeats.
5. ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"" — ""green"" repeats.

With these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before 'bluf'.""",-0.11541038727346156,85,bluf
"To figure out the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the given input and corresponding output examples. Let's see how ""bluf"" is used in different contexts:

1. Input: wif bluf dax — Output: red red green
2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf — Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
3. Input: dax lug wif bluf — Output: green blue red red
4. Input: wif dax bluf — Output: red green green
5. Input: dax bluf — Output: green green

In each example, ""bluf"" is followed by colors in the output. Here is the pattern we can observe:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and ""dax."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""dax"" in these cases, ""bluf"" also corresponds to the same color as ""dax.""
- In examples 2, 3, and 4, ""bluf"" follows different words and still results in ""red."" It's important to note that in example 2, the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" but this is because it is preceded by the word ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and is repeated.

Given this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that comes before it. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it turns green. If ""bluf"" follows other words, it takes on a different color (""red"" in the case of ""wif"" and ""blue"" when following ""lug"" and repeated). Because ""wif"" and ""dax"" seem to determine the color directly before ""bluf,"" it's plausible to guess that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat the previous color"" or ""copy the color of the preceding word if the preceding word is 'dax.'""

Since ""dax"" seems to have a special impact on ""bluf,"" and for simplicity without further contrary examples, we can suggest a rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeat the color indicated by the word immediately before ""bluf,"" specifically ""green"" if preceded by ""dax."" 

Please note this rule is tentatively inferred from the limited examples provided and could be subject to change with additional context.",-0.11719100950471792,85,bluf

1. When ""wif"" leads, the output starts with ""red red red"".
2. When ""zup"" leads, the output starts with ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. When ""dax"" leads, the output starts with ""green green green"".
4. After the leading triples, the pattern seems to change, depending on what follows.

With these points in mind, let’s focus on the usage of ""walm"" in the inputs and its corresponding outputs:

- ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in a repetition of ""red"". Hence, it seems like ""walm"" could mean ""repeat"".
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" also results in yellow being repeated.
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" also results in green being repeated.
- ""walm"" when followed by ""lug"" has a consistent presence of ""blue"" in the output.

Given these points, it looks like ""walm"" might be a command for repetition - it causes the color corresponding to the prior word to be repeated multiple times in the output.

So ""walm"" after ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax"" causes the color red, yellow, or green, respectively, to be repeated. In cases where ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" there seems to be an occurrence of ""blue"" that is consistently present whether ""walm"" is preceded by any of the other words.

Based on these findings, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word. If followed by ""lug,"" introduce ""blue"" after the repetition.",-0.06513882226489585,85,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" look for the pattern of color outputs after the word ""walm"" is used in the input.

In the first example:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, after the first ""walm,"" the colors are ""yellow blue,"" and after the second ""walm,"" the colors are ""yellow yellow yellow."" We can't yet determine if ""walm"" means a color or a rule affecting subsequent words.

In the second example:
Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

After ""walm,"" we have the color ""red"" associated with ""wif,"" which seems consistent with ""wif"" always giving ""red"" in previous examples.

In the third example:
Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

After ""walm,"" we see the color ""blue"" repeated twice, which corresponds to the previous color output for ""lug."" This might suggest that ""walm"" repeats the previous color.

In the fourth example:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Here, ""walm"" again is followed by ""blue,"" which is the color output for ""lug."" This reinforces the rule from the third example that ""walm"" repeats the previous color.

In the fifth example:
Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Once again, after ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated, matching the previous ""dax"" color output.

Considering all examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color output associated with the word that comes immediately before it in the input. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word in the input sequence.",-0.06817140184998959,85,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the patterns in the provided examples. I will look for correlations between the appearances of ""walm"" and the associated colors in the output.

1. In the first example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""walm"" appears twice, and following its first appearance, the color red is repeated. After the second appearance of ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated.

2. In the second example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, the word ""walm"" is followed by a repeated red.

3. In the third example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" The word ""walm"" is at the end, and it is followed by a repeated blue.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by repeated reds, then a blue word and a blue output.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue."" The ""walm"" is followed by repeated greens.

From these observations, we can derive a possible rule for ""walm."" It seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> causes the next part of the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm.""",-0.08465372069296874,85,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to dictate the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Each time ""walm"" appears, the color corresponding to the previous word is repeated in the output before moving on to the next color.

Here is a breakdown:

1. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the color red, associated with ""wif,"" to be repeated twice more.

2. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" which shows ""walm"" causing the color yellow, associated with ""zup,"" to be repeated twice more.

3. ""lug walm"" in the third example does not explicitly exist, but based on the pattern, if it did, we would expect ""blue blue"" following ""lug,"" as ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm lug"" leads to ""red red red blue blue,"" again ""walm"" repeats the color red associated with ""wif"" before continuing to ""lug"" which translates to blue.

5. Finally, ""dax walm zup"" leads to ""green green green yellow,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color green, associated with ""dax,"" before moving on to ""zup"" which is associated with yellow.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated twice more before moving on to the next color.",-1.0450317312879163,85,walm
"To deduce the meaning or the underlying rule for the nonce word ""walm"", let's look closely at the given input-output pairings and search for a consistent pattern that is attributed to ""walm"":

- In every sequence where ""walm"" occurs, the word that is immediately before ""walm"" is repeated in color form. For instance:
  - Input: ""wif walm"" leads to Output: ""red red red"". Here ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""
  - Input: ""zup walm"" leads to Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow.""
  - Input: ""dax walm"" leads to Output: ""green green green"". Here ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green.""
  - Input: ""lug walm"" results in a repeat of the color that corresponds to ""lug,"" which seems to be ""blue.""

- Also, after the repetition of colors corresponding to the word before ""walm,"" we observe additional ""red"" colors added. The number of ""red"" colors added appears to be relative to the number of times ""walm"" is said in the input:
  - Once ""walm"" is said (e.g., ""wif walm""), we observe one extra ""red.""
  - Twice ""walm"" is said (e.g., ""zup walm zup walm""), we observe two extra ""reds.""

Considering these observations, the rule associated with ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated, and additional ""red(s)"" added equals to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned in the sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's examine the consistencies in the examples.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- 'zup' and 'bluf' both translate to 'yellow'.

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red
- 'zup' is the second word and translates to 'yellow' again.
- This indicates 'dax' is 'green' and 'wif' is 'red'.

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- Consistent with previous examples, 'zup' is 'yellow', and 'bluf' is 'yellow'. 'dax' is 'green'.

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
- The word 'lug' translates to 'blue', as it is one-for-one with the output.
- 'walm' is followed by doubled output, indicating that 'walm' also translates to 'blue' but results in a doubled output of 'blue yellow'.
- When 'zup' follows 'walm', it results in 'yellow'.

Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
- Again, 'zup' and 'bluf' translate to 'yellow'. 'lug' translates to 'blue'.
- Since 'zup' is at the end and still translates to a single 'yellow', it suggests that 'zup' translates to 'yellow' without influence by position.

Observing these consistent translations, the rule for 'zup' can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

'zup' consistently means 'yellow' irrespective of its position in the input.",-0.0978169612436883,86,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs where ""zup"" is present:

2. dax zup wif -> green yellow red
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
5. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow

From these examples, we can see that when ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output always includes ""yellow."" Also, it seems that the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output is equal to the number of times ""zup"" appears in the input, independent of order.

5. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow

We notice that ""zup"" appears multiple times in each input and is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be consistent across all examples:

When ""bluf"" stands alone, it maintains the color translation corresponding to the word that directly precedes it in prior usage, or possibly the word that most commonly precedes it.

Here are the examples with the corresponding color translations:

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green"". ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and therefore is ""yellow"".

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" so it is ""yellow"".

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""wif"" is a new word and correlates with ""red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and therefore is ""blue"".

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows it, thus ""bluf"" is ""green"".

Rule: Bluf -> takes on the color of the word that precedes it (yellow when following ""zup,"" blue when following ""lug,"" and green when following ""dax""). If ""bluf"" is standalone, it retains the color associated with its most recent or most common preceding word.",-0.08233363696656165,86,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the preceding word. To verify, let's break down the examples:

In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" also maps to ""yellow.""

In the third example, ""zup"" again maps to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows suit, while ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

In the fourth example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is used after ""lug"" and also maps to ""blue.""

In the last example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""bluf,"" which follows ""dax,"" also maps to ""green.""

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following connections between the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output position.
- The words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" seem to correspond to the colors ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively, based on their positions and consistent color output.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

"To figure out what ""bluf"" means, we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. What's consistent with the output when ""bluf"" is in the input?

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"".

It seems that the word ""bluf"" is associated with a color in the output. However, ""bluf"" does not produce a constant color but rather mirrors the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" after ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples.

- In the first example, the output is ""green blue blue blue"" for an input that includes ""dax lug walm."" We can't directly deduce the meaning of ""walm"" yet, as it is the first example, but we can keep this in mind for comparison with further examples.

- The second input is ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" and the output is ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" There is one occurrence of ""lug"" and ""dax"" before ""walm"" and several of ""zup."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" but since it doesn't appear in other examples, it's hard to deduce a pattern for ""walm"" from this alone.

- In the third example, we have ""zup walm lug,"" which leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" we can deduce that ""walm"" is likely to be responsible for some of the ""yellow"" outcomes. This implies that ""walm"" might have to do with repeating the color associated with the word that appears directly before it.

- The fourth example says ""wif lug dax walm,"" with an output of ""red blue green green green."" We know that ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Following the previous assumption that ""walm"" implies repetition, we see that ""green"" is repeated after ""dax,"" which is consistent with the idea that ""walm"" repeats the previous color.

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" Only ""lug"" and ""walm"" are in the input, and since we know ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" this strengthens the idea that ""walm"" implies repetition since ""blue"" is the color outputted three times.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to represent a repetition of the color preceding it. Let's analyze the examples to derive the rule:

In the first example,
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""blue"" three times.

In the second example,
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color of the last ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" three times.

In the third example,

Again, ""zup"" gets translated into ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" three times, followed by ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the input strings and their respective outputs.

- In every instance, ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""

Now, let's examine the use of ""walm"" in the examples:

1. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" Based on previous examples, ""dax"" is ""green"" and the first ""lug"" is ""blue."" We can assume that ""walm"" here corresponds to the repeated color ""blue.""

2. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" gives us ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Again, the known words correlate to their respective colors, and ""walm"" seems to correspond with the repetition of the last color mentioned before it, which is ""yellow"" in this case.

3. ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Zup"" is known to be ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Walm"" appears to result in a repetition of ""yellow.""

4. ""wif lug dax walm"" equates to ""red blue green green green."" Here, ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""Walm"" seems responsible for the repetition of ""green.""

5. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" With ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""blue.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input string.

"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we should first look for patterns and commonalities in the input and output pairs. Let's examine the relationship between each input containing ""walm"" and its corresponding output.

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
3. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
4. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

Let's identify the output for each non-""walm"" word based on their appearances in the input-output pairs:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Now let's look at each example where ""walm"" appears and what happens to the output:

1. dax lug walm -> green blue *blue blue blue*
   - ""dax"" outputs green, and ""lug"" outputs blue. After ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times, indicating ""walm"" might mean repeat the previous color three times.

2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow *yellow yellow yellow*
   - Before ""walm,"" ""zup"" outputs yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated three times, reinforcing that ""walm"" could mean repeat the previous color three times.

3. zup walm lug -> yellow *yellow yellow yellow* blue
   - Here, ""zup"" outputs yellow, followed by ""walm,"" and again we see yellow repeated three times before moving on to the next color by ""lug,"" which is blue.

4. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green *green green green*
   - Before ""walm,"" ""dax"" outputs green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated three times.

5. lug walm -> blue *blue blue blue*
   - ""Lug"" outputs blue, then ""walm"" is followed by blue repeated three times, consistent with the previous examples.

Based on the observed patterns, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the previous color output three times.

So, ""walm"" corresponds to the rule of repeating the color word given just before it, three times in the output.",-0.1150879658783735,86,walm
"From the examples provided, each instance of the word ""walm"" seems to produce a sequence of color outputs that is homogenous—each instance of ""walm"" generates multiple repetitions of one color in the output. Also, the color that follows ""walm"" seems to be determined by the word immediately preceding it. 

In the rules below, ""preceding word"" refers to the word that comes just before ""walm.""

Here's how ""walm"" operates based on the examples:

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
3. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
4. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

Analyzing each case:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue blue."" 
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" once again follows ""zup"" and the output is yet again ""yellow yellow yellow."" 
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green green.""
- In example 5, with ""walm"" following ""lug"" once more, we get ""blue blue blue.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word immediately prior to it, and that repetition is threefold. The word ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""dax"" with green. 

Rule: walm -> ""Repeats the color output associated with the immediately preceding word three times.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" based on the provided context is:
walm -> Repeats the color output associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",-0.11988098240228919,86,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the repetitive patterns where ""lug"" appears and the corresponding outputs it produces.

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

- Here, the word that precedes ""lug"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

- In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

- ""lug"" follows two different words here: ""zup"" and ""wif"", which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red,"" respectively, yet after both instances of ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

- This example is repeated and continues to show that ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

- In this example, ""lug"" is both the first word and follows ""wif."" The outputs are ""blue blue"" at the start, suggesting that ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue."" ""walm"" and ""wif"" follow the first ""lug"" and correspond to ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively. A second ""lug"" after ""wif"" gives ""blue"" again. ""Bluf"" also results in ""blue.""

From these examples, the common factor for every instance of the word ""lug"" is that the output is always ""blue,"" regardless of its position or the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

"By analyzing the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""lug"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. 

Let's look for patterns related to the word ""lug"":

1. Every instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
2. ""lug"" does not seem to modify the color associated with the adjacent words, as other words in the inputs have consistent color outputs whether they are adjacent to ""lug"" or not.

From these observations, it appears that ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"" in the output irrespective of its position or surrounding words in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should examine how it is used in relation to other words in the examples provided and their corresponding outputs.

Let's analyze:

1. ""dax wif lug"" translates to ""green red blue.""
2. ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue.""
3. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green.""
5. ""wif zup lug"" translates to ""red yellow blue.""

Looking at these examples, we can try to identify what each word translates to based on repetition and placement:

- ""dax"" appears in the first, second, third, and fourth examples, and it always translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" appears in the first, second, and third examples, and it always translates to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" appears in the third and fourth examples, and it translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" appears in the third and fourth examples, and when it follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" appears in the fifth example, and it translates to ""yellow.""

Now let's focus on ""wif."" Looking at the placement of ""wif"" and its corresponding output ""red,"" we can see that every time ""wif"" is used, it translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position with respect to the other words.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that irrespective of its context or position in the input, ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",-0.11127315880376089,87,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" correlates with the color red. Here's how we can deduce this:

- In the first example, ""dax wif lug"" translates to ""green red blue,"" with ""wif"" in the second position and ""red"" also in the second position. 
- In the second example, ""lug dax wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue green red blue,"" with ""wif"" again aligning with the color ""red."" 
- In the third example, where ""wif"" occurs multiple times, each instance of ""wif"" is consistently replaced with the color ""red."" 
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears first and translates to ""red,"" maintaining consistency with the previous examples. 
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""zup lug,"" which corresponds to ""yellow blue,"" again leaving ""wif"" matched with ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",-1.0390719653624998,87,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's first identify consistent relationships between the other words and their corresponding colors:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Now we can focus on the examples to determine what ""wif"" corresponds to:

- When ""wif"" is before ""lug"" (example 1 and example 5), the color ""red"" comes before the color ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" (example 3 and example 4), the color ""red"" comes before another ""red.""
- ""wif"" appears alone (not directly followed by any other word) at the end of example 3, and is translated to ""red.""

However, if we observe the sequence in which ""wif"" appears, it always corresponds to the color ""red."" This consistency can be found in every example provided. 

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as:

"To induce the rule for ""zup,"" we need to analyze the correlation between the input and output in each example. Let's examine each one:

1. Input: ""zup dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow green green green""
   
   Without more context, it is not obvious what each word stands for, but we can say with some certainty that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as it is the only word that appears once in both input and output.

2. Input: ""zup wif lug zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   
   Again, ""zup"" at the beginning of the sequence corresponds to ""yellow"" at the beginning of the output. The second occurrence of ""zup"" is followed by two ""yellow,"" which may suggest that ""zup"" not only corresponds to ""yellow"" but might also repeat the color one additional time in the output or could be affected by the following word ""walm."" 

3. Input: ""lug zup""
   Output: ""blue yellow""
   
   With ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" the one-to-one correspondence remains consistent.

4. Input: ""wif zup bluf""
   Output: ""red yellow yellow""
   
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to the first ""yellow,"" and it seems that ""bluf"" may repeat the previous color (in this case, ""yellow"").

5. Input: ""wif dax zup dax""
   Output: ""red green yellow green""
   
   ""zup"" is between two ""dax"" and corresponds to ""yellow."" It is not repeating a color before or after it, which suggests that the double ""yellow"" in previous examples might be influenced by a specific word, such as ""bluf"" or ""walm.""

From these patterns, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds with ""yellow,"" both when it appears alone and when surrounded by other words. The repetition of colors in the outputs seems to be influenced by other words, rather than ""zup"" itself.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.09036140997867496,87,zup
"Based on the examples provided, each time the nonce word ""zup"" occurs in the input, the output features ""yellow."" Here are the matched patterns:

- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"" (both 'zup' instances correspond to the first and fourth yellow)
- ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"" (zup corresponds to yellow)
- ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow"" (zup corresponds to the first yellow)
- ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green"" (zup corresponds to yellow)

The other words in the inputs, ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" correspond to different colors in their respective positions, and they are consistent across different inputs as well.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""zup"":

- In every instance, the occurrence of the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""zup"" does not seem to affect the color outputs of the words around it.
- Other words, like ""dax"", ""wif"" and ""lug"", seem to correspond to different colors (green, red, and blue respectively).

Given this pattern, it appears that ""zup"" directly correlates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input.


Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-1.3122537540592503,87,zup

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" it's necessary to identify patterns in each input that correlates with the appearance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output. In each case, ""bluf"" is included in the input, while ""red red"" is consistently part of the output. Here are the correlations for each input and output:

- Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
- Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
- Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
- Input: dax bluf wif lug zup -> Output: green green red blue yellow
- Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red

In the third input, ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green,"" and in the fourth, ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" it is ""green green red blue yellow."" The presence of ""wif"" and ""dax"" in these inputs impacts the output colors, particularly the position of ""green."" Despite the different sequences in the inputs, ""bluf"" consistently maps to the double ""red"" in the output.

There is a clear pattern for ""bluf,"" and we can see that other words in the inputs correspond to specific output colors. For example:
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

Therefore, ""wif"" does not seem to induce any color by itself, but it appears directly before ""bluf"" in each input.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> red red

This rule indicates that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red red"" will be part of the corresponding output.",-0.09424171775702438,87,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at the correlation between the inputs and outputs. Here are the examples provided with input and output pairs:

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   
2. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   
3. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   
4. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   
5. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

From the given examples, we notice the following patterns:
- ""bluf"" is always translated into two reds in the output (except when it is affected by the word right before it, as in example 4 ""dax bluf wif"").
- ""wif"" translates into a single red, and ""dax"" translates into a single green.
- The words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" seem to translate into yellow, blue, and blue respectively.
- ""bluf"" seems to be affected by the word right before it. For example, in example 4, there is an occurrence of ""dax bluf"" together which translates into ""green green"" instead of the expected ""green red red.""

Rule: ""bluf"" translates into ""red red,"" unless immediately preceded by ""dax,"" which changes the output to ""green green."" There might be other rules affecting ""bluf,"" but we don't have enough examples to determine what those are.

Based on the information given, the translation rule is:
bluf -> red red (default translation, modified when immediately preceded by ""dax"" to green green)",-0.10206988518019514,87,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples, we first look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. An input containing ""wif bluf"" consistently results in an output with ""red red"":
   - ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
   - ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
   - ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
   - ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""

2. When ""bluf"" appears between two words, the colors corresponding to these words appear in the output in reversed order:
   - ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green"" (`wif` corresponds to ""red"" and `dax` to ""green""; ""red"" appears before ""green"" in the output, which is the reverse of the input order)
   - ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" -> ""green green red blue yellow"" (`dax` corresponds to ""green"" and `wif` to ""red""; ""green"" appears before ""red"" in the output, which is the reverse of the input order)

Given these observations, ""bluf"" seems to be a function that affects the order of the colors in the output. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the result is always ""red red"". When ""bluf"" appears between two words, it reverses the order of the corresponding colors in the output.

Rule: bluf -> reverses the order of the colors corresponding to the words immediately before and after it, or when following ""wif"", results in ""red red"".",-0.20030769529707318,87,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs provided:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" (Examples 1, 3, 5)
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""green red."" (Example 3)
- When ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" the output is ""green red red."" (Example 5)
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug walm wif,"" the output is ""blue blue red red."" (Example 2)
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" but precedes ""wif"" and ""lug zup,"" the output is ""green red blue yellow."" (Example 4)

From these observations, the common element whenever ""bluf"" is present is ""red."" More specifically, it seems that ""bluf"" is represented by two consecutive ""red"" colors in the output. The presence of ""bluf"" does not affect the output of other words which maintain their color representation (""dax"" = green, ""wif"" = red, ""lug"" = blue, ""zup"" = yellow).

However, two reds (representing ""bluf"") appear after every word that comes before ""bluf"" in the input, and the preceding words determine the color output for the part before these reds. Thus, ""wif bluf"" consistently results in ""red red.""

Rule: bluf -> two consecutive ""red"" colors in the output, occurring after the color represented by the word that comes before ""bluf.""",-0.6367679625247561,87,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the examples and find patterns corresponding to the colors in the outputs:

- The word ""bluf"" always corresponds to a sequence of ""red red"" in the output.
- The color sequence does not seem to vary with the positions of ""wif"" or ""bluf"" in the input string, suggesting that ""bluf"" reliably translates to this color pair regardless of context.

This suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds specifically to a fixed sequence of colors.

Rule: bluf -> ""red red""",-1.6383774617390248,87,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can notice that the output associated with ""walm"" seems to vary depending on other words present in the input. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

To determine the rule for ""walm,"" let's look for patterns before and after ""walm"" appears:

- In the first input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output after ""lug"" is ""blue,"" which is the same color as before ""walm."" Then ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" and the color changes to ""green."" This is the same pattern for colors both before and after ""dax"" without ""walm.""
- In the second input, the pattern is similar to the first, where ""lug"" precedes and follows ""walm,"" with ""blue"" color outputs. The word ""wif"" causes the output to change to ""red"" after ""walm.""
- In the third input, ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red,"" and after ""dax"" and ""zup,"" the colors are ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The ""walm"" occurs after ""zup,"" and the color stays ""yellow.""
- The fourth input is simply ""zup walm,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that the presence of ""zup"" continues as ""yellow"" after ""walm.""
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" before ""walm"" changes the color to ""red"" and this color persists after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" does not change the color itself. Rather, it causes the repetition or continuation of the color determined by the word that immediately precedes it. If no word precedes it, as in input 4, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting a default color state of ""yellow"" in the absence of a preceding word that would determine color.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately before it; if there is no preceding word, the default output color is yellow.",-0.0645377318788152,87,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the color output changes in the provided examples and their corresponding inputs. 

1. In the first input:
   - ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" produces ""blue blue blue green red blue red.""
     Note that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" corresponds to red, while ""dax"" corresponds to green.

2. In the second input:
   - ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" produces ""blue blue blue red blue blue.""
     Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which again induces blue then red in the output.

3. In the third input:
   - ""lug wif dax zup walm"" produces ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow.""
     ""lug"" leads to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" we see repeated yellow.

4. In the fourth input:
   - ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow.""
     ""Walm"" comes after ""zup"" alone and results in repeated yellow.

5. In the fifth input:
   - ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red.""
     When ""walm"" is following ""zup"" and ""wif,"" it results in repeated red.

From the above observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word or words to be repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color indicated by the preceding word (or words if ""walm"" follows multiple colors) in the sequence.",-0.0833099884022174,87,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, I will first look for a pattern in each example—specifically, where the word ""walm"" appears and the colors that are outputted immediately following it.

Example 1:
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
Here, ""walm"" is followed by two instances of ""blue"" and then a change in color to ""green"" upon the introduction of a new word, ""dax"".

Example 2:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
In this case, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" and remains consistent until ""wif"", where it changes to ""red"".

Example 3:
Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" comes at the end of the sequence and is followed by three instances of ""yellow"".

Example 4:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and is associated with three ""yellow"" colors.

Example 5:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is associated with three instances of ""red"".

From these examples, we can observe that the word ""walm"" is linked to the next word being outputted three times in the same color that would be associated with that word when it appears at the beginning of the sequence. For instance, ""lug walm dax"" led to ""blue blue blue"", and ""lug"" alone leads to ""blue"", while ""zup walm"" led to ""yellow yellow yellow"", and ""zup"" alone leads to ""yellow"".

Based on the examples provided, it seems the word ""walm"" indicates that the following word's associated color should be repeated three times.

Rule:
walm -> the next word's color is to be repeated three times.",-0.08848280251036958,87,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing on where ""walm"" appears:

1. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
2. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
3. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

From example 4, we see that ""zup walm"" translates only to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" by itself could translate to ""yellow.""

However, in example 5, when ""wif"" is added before ""walm,"" the output ""walm"" changed to ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" changes color depending on what comes before it. In this case, ""wif"" causes ""walm"" to switch from ""yellow"" to ""red.""

Considering example 1 and example 3, the presence of ""dax"" and ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""walm"" outputting ""blue,"" not ""yellow"" or ""red.""

Combining this information, it seems that ""walm"" changes its output based on the preceding word. The most consistent rules that can be gleaned from this would be:
- ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""blue"" (seen in examples 1 and 2).
- ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" if it's only ""zup walm,"" but ""red"" if ""wif"" is also there before ""walm"" (seen in examples 4 and 5).
- ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" also results in ""red.""

Given this, it's hard to pin down a single meaning for ""walm"" without more information. It could change based on context or be a kind of function word that alters according to preceding elements. However, for simplicity and based on the data given, we could derive a provisional rule:

Rule: ""walm"" changes its output color according to the word that precedes it: ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""zup"" by itself results in ""yellow,"" ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""wif"" by itself also results in ""red.""",-0.08911645111689133,87,walm

2. Input: dax lug bluf dax

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the association between the inputs and outputs in different cases.

In every example, the word ""walm"" appears to cause the word that comes right before it to be repeated in the output. Let's look at the examples to see if this pattern holds true:

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Here, ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" repeating ""blue"" an extra time.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Again, ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" and we see ""blue"" repeated an extra time (blue blue blue) in the output.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Once more, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated an extra time.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

The same pattern: ""lug"" before ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

In this case, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""red"" is repeated an extra time.

Based on these examples, we can define a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated once more in the output sequence.",-0.08711325443716869,88,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the following word to have the same output as the preceding word. Here is the analysis for each example:

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
   - ""dax"" changes to ""green""
   - ""wif"" changes to ""red""
   - ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red""

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""blue""
   - ""walm zup"" results in ""blue blue""
   - ""wif"" at the end results in ""red""

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - again, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""

5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - ""wif walm"" results in ""red red""
   - ""zup"" changes to ""yellow""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is introduced after a word, the output for ""walm"" and the word immediately following ""walm"" will be the same as the output for the word that precedes ""walm"".

Walm -> Causes the next word to repeat the output/color of the word before ""walm"".",-0.10583254346356626,88,walm
"By examining the patterns that emerge in relation to the word ""walm"" in the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule that underlies it.

In the first example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" maps to ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". Every time ""lug"" appears either alone or in conjunction with ""walm"", the output is ""blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" maps to ""blue"". However, when ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", we get two consecutive ""blue"" outputs before the color that corresponds to the next word. This seems to suggest that ""walm"" may act as a duplicator or repeater of the color that comes before it.

In the second example, ""dax lug walm zup wif"" maps to ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""lug"" which is ""blue"", ""walm"" follows, again resulting in an additional ""blue"". This pattern continues with ""zup"" to ""yellow"", but there is no ""walm"" after it to require a repetition of ""yellow"".

In the third and fourth examples, the same sequence ""lug walm"" consistently gives us ""blue blue blue"", reinforcing the idea of repetition associated with ""walm"".

Finally, the fifth example ""wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow"". ""Wif"" maps to ""red"", and after ""walm"" we see the repetition of ""red"" before moving on to ""yellow"" for ""zup"". 

To confirm the hypothesis, let's write the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> meaning. When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the next word in the sequence to repeat the output color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".

If we take the pattern ""word1 walm word2"", the outputs are ""color1 color1 color(for word2)"".",-0.2765655018215663,88,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs. Look for patterns in the sequences where ""walm"" appears.

- In the first input (lug walm dax wif lug wif), ""walm"" is surrounded by ""lug"" and ""dax."" The output corresponding to those three words is ""blue blue blue,"" with ""blue"" occurring twice for ""lug"" and once for ""walm."" We also know the output for ""dax"" is ""green"" and for ""wif"" is ""red"" based on this and other examples.

- In the second input (dax lug walm zup wif), ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again, and the output for ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" results in ""blue"" when following ""lug.""

- In the third and fourth inputs, ""lug walm"" standalone. Both times, the output is ""blue blue blue.""

- In the fifth input (wif walm zup), ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif walm"" is ""red red,"" which means that ""walm"" produces ""red"" after ""wif.""

Considering these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" is acting as a repeater for the color associated with the word that precedes it. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue""), the output corresponding to ""walm"" is also ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs ""red""), the output for ""walm"" is also ""red.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.

The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.",-0.5716410668350601,88,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns tied to each occurrence of ""walm.""

In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax"" and ""wif."" The output sequence for this part is ""blue blue blue green red"" where ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of the color blue thrice followed by green once (since ""dax"" is followed by green).

In the second example, ""walm"" is again preceded by ""lug"" but followed by ""zup."" The output adjacent to this is ""blue blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of blue four times (preceded by the blue for ""lug"").

The third and fourth examples are the same; ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating a repetition of blue three times, consistent with the first example.

The fifth input,""wif walm zup,"" shows ""walm"" preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup,"" this yields ""red red red yellow."" Here ""walm"" corresponds to the color red being repeated three times, like the color that ""wif"" translates to.

From these observations, we can guess that ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the color that precedes it. The number of times the color is repeated depends on the word that follows ""walm."" 

If ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" the preceding color repeats three times, and if followed by ""zup,"" the preceding color repeats three times as well. Since there's no instance of ""walm"" being both preceded and followed by different color-words that aren’t ""lug"" (""blue"") or ""wif"" (""red""), our rule is based on limited evidence and may not accurately predict what happens with other preceding colors or following words. However, based on the data we have, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the preceding color word in the output, repeated as many times as the sequence before a different color word appears after ""walm"".",-0.7345114852256629,88,walm

- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red""

When looking at ""dax"":

- ""zup lug dax"" becomes ""yellow blue green""
- ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue""
- ""dax lug"" becomes ""green blue""
- ""wif zup dax bluf"" includes an unknown word ""bluf"" at the end. Since the sequence translates to ""red yellow green green"", and we know the meanings of ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""dax"", we may assume ""bluf"" translates to another ""green"". However, we can ignore ""bluf"" for the purpose of deducing the meaning of ""dax"".
- ""zup wif dax walm"" becomes ""yellow red green green green"", confirming that ""walm"" corresponds to multiple ""blue"" and that ""dax"" equates to a single ""green"".

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" is directly followed by two reds.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

- This is a repeated input/output confirming the consistency of ""wif"" with red and ""walm"" followed by two reds.

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" is paired with two blues here.

From the examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word it follows before the next color word. For every input of ""walm,"" there is a repetition of the preceding color before moving on to the next color word. However, since we don't have examples of ""walm"" with a different preceding word, we cannot confirm if ""walm"" always triples the previous color, or it just adds two more occurrences. To be conservative, based on the given examples, we can say that:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats the color of that word two additional times before moving to the next color.

Rule: If ""walm"" is preceded by a word that corresponds to a color, output that color twice more before processing the next word.",-0.08093051805023374,89,walm
"According to the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Let's analyze the examples to confirm this:

1. Example: ""zup walm lug wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
   Here ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and next we see two additional ""yellow"" which may be due to ""walm."" The ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red"" with ""bluf"" possibly being a misspelling that should have resulted in an additional ""red.""

2. Example: ""dax wif walm""
   Output: ""green red red red""
   ""Dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" followed by ""walm"" which seems to have caused the single ""red"" to become three ""red"" in the output.

3. Example: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red""
   Without ""walm"" we would expect ""wif"" to produce one ""red,"" but with ""walm,"" we get three ""red,"" again suggesting repetition.

4. Example: ""lug walm wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue red""
   ""Lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" seems to cause ""blue"" to repeat, followed by ""wif"" which corresponds with ""red.""

These examples indicate that ""walm"" results in the color of the previous word being repeated a number of times. However, the exact number of repetitions may vary based on context we can't see (for example, there are two additional yellows in the first example, and two additional reds in the second). Since all examples lead to repetitions, but the amount is inconsistent across the examples, we can't determine a precise rule for the number of repetitions.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated multiple times in the output. The exact number of repetitions may vary or depend on other context not provided in the examples.

Rule: When walm is used after a color word, that color word is outputted multiple times, with the precise number of repetitions possibly depending on additional context.",-0.18539662655805192,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to the patterns where ""walm"" appears:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the output is three ""red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is three ""blue.""

In all instances, the appearance of ""walm"" leads to a triplication of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Hence, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

- In the second and third examples, 'zup' precedes 'walm' and 'zup' corresponds to yellow. The output is thrice yellow following 'zup'.
- In the fourth example, 'lug' precedes the first 'walm' and is blue, resulting in three blues in the output. The second occurence of 'walm' does not have a word after it, so this doesn't provide further information about the rule.
- In the fifth example, 'dax' precedes the first 'walm' and is green, resulting in three greens. The second 'walm' follows 'zup', which is yellow, resulting in three yellows.

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by identifying patterns corresponding to the colors:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" which is outputted as ""red,"" and the following output is a repetition of ""red."" Hence, ""walm"" may indicate a repetition of the previous color.

2. In the second and third inputs, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is outputted as ""yellow,"" and the output is solely ""yellow."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" could signify a repetition of the preceding color.

3. In the fourth input, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, and again ""blue"" is repeated after ""walm.""

4. Finally, in the fifth input, ""walm"" appears twice after ""dax"" and ""zup,"" corresponding to ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, and in the output, these colors are repeated an additional two times for ""green"" and three times for ""yellow"" after each instance of ""walm.""

2. Input: zup lug wif dax lug

3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif

   - ""wif"" appears multiple times here. ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green"" (as seen in the second example). ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" and ""zup wif"" to ""yellow red.""

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif walm"" to ""red red red.""

   - ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue,"" and ""bluf zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow.""

Although the precise meaning of ""wif"" is not immediately clear from these examples alone, it appears that ""wif"" could operate as a modifier that adds ""red"" to the sequence of colors outputted. More specifically, ""wif"" seems to be followed by one or more ""red,"" and then the color corresponding to the next word.

Considering this pattern, we formulate the following rule:

Rule: wif -> The word ""wif"" modifies the sequence by adding a ""red"" to the output before the color corresponding to the next word in the input sequence.

This rule is consistent with all the given examples.",-0.0881729492025222,91,wif

4. Input: lug wif walm | Output: blue red red red
5. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup | Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

Let's look at where ""wif"" appears and the output in those positions:

1. ""wif lug"" outputs ""red blue"". Here ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and ""lug"" leads to ""blue"". Since there's an extra ""red"" before ""blue"", ""wif"" in this case contributes ""red"".
2. ""zup lug wif dax lug"" outputs ""yellow blue red green blue"". ""wif"" is before ""dax"" and yields ""red"". In this example, ""wif"" also correlates with ""red"".
3. In the third example, ""wif"" appears multiple times:
   - ""wif dax"" gives us ""red green"".
   - ""wif bluf"" gives us ""red red"".
   - ""wif"" at the end gives us ""red"".
   In every instance, ""wif"" contributes a ""red"".
4. ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""blue red red red"". Since ""lug"" on its own converts to a single ""blue"", the ""wif walm"" part must be yielding ""red red red"".
5. In the last example, ""wif"" is in the middle of ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"", with the output being ""blue blue red blue blue yellow"". The position of ""wif"" coincides with the color ""red"" again.

From these inputs and outputs, we can deduce that ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" in the output. However, there seems to be no particular pattern on how many times ""red"" appears after ""wif"" without further context or information—it varies based on what follows ""wif"".

Given the data and aiming to make a simple rule, here's what we can conclude:

- Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green (where ""dax"" represents green, and following ""bluf"", green is repeated)
- Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green (where ""zup"" represents yellow, and following ""bluf"", yellow is repeated)
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red (where ""zup"" represents yellow, and following ""bluf"", yellow is repeated)
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow (where ""zup"" represents yellow, and following ""bluf"", yellow is repeated)

"Based on the examples provided:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" which means ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes just before it. In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" appears after ""lug dax wif dax,"" the output sequence is ""blue green green red green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, and the output is still ""red red,"" again repeating the color associated with the preceding word.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow yellow,"" which means ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the sequence ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" the output for the part ""zup bluf"" is ""yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and outputs, focusing on the instances where ""walm"" appears.

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which is blue, and ""zup"" which is yellow.
   
2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup  
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which is green, and ""zup"" which is yellow.
   
3. Input: zup wif dax walm  
   Output: yellow red green green green
   
   Here, ""walm"" is at the end. Notably, ""dax,"" which is green, precedes ""walm.""
   
4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm  
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
   Here, ""walm"" appears twice, and each time it is preceded by ""dax"" which is green. The outputs following ""walm"" are green regardless of the words that come after.
   
5. Input: dax walm zup  
   Output: green green green yellow
   
   Again, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" which is green, and is followed by ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Looking at these examples, the word ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding words. While there is a pattern that ""walm"" often follows ""dax"" which also translates to green, every instance of ""walm"" results in the word ""green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" specifically means ""green.""

Rule: walm -> green",-0.05715847784319048,91,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color. To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" lets look at its placement and the corresponding color output in each example:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""walm"" first corresponds to ""green"" and again ""green""

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""

From the above, it seems there might be a pattern that when ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it corresponds to ""green."" In other instances, it corresponds to ""yellow."" However, there's not enough consistent evidence to conclude this definitively, except within the given examples. Thus, we need to check this rule against more examples to see if it holds true.

Based on the provided data, the tentative rule is:

Rule: When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it means green. In other positions, it means yellow.",-0.07995428735281905,91,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its occurrence within the given examples and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   
2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

From these examples, it seems that the occurrence of ""walm"" is directly translated into ""green."" Additionally, in the examples where other colors are present, ""walm"" occurs more than once—and it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the next color is still ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the next color is still ""green.""
- Multiple occurrences of ""walm"" result in multiple instances of ""green.""

Therefore, based on these observations, the rule for the word ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or context in the input string.",-0.08340070455439048,91,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" maps to a repeated color output. In all instances, ""walm"" produces repeated instances of the color green. However, the count of repetition seems to be influenced by the position of ""walm"" and possibly the words around it. By examining each sequence:

1. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, ""walm"" is proceeded by one ""zup"" and produces three ""yellow"" before the word ""lug"" changes the color to blue. 

2. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" yields ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and results in three ""yellow,"" but it is followed by ""dax"" which changes the output color to green.

3. ""zup wif dax walm"" yields ""yellow red green green green."" ""Walm"" produces three greens without a preceding ""zup,"" indicating that the number of greens might not be directly tied to the presence of ""zup.""

4. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" yields ""green green green red blue green green green."" When ""walm"" appears twice, each instance produces a variable number of greens. 

However, a clear, consistent rule for the number of greens is not immediately apparent from these examples. Several examples lead to ""green"" being repeated three times after ""walm,"" but the last example breaks this pattern with an additional ""green."" It might be that the rules require more information or more examples to clarify how many times ""green"" should be repeated after ""walm."" It could be related to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence or the specific combination of words before and after it.

From the provided data, a tentatively inferred rule would be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> maps to one or more consecutive instances of the word ""green,"" with the exact number possibly influenced by its position in the sequence and surrounding words.",-0.2453526752210762,91,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns associated with that word in the different examples and their respective outputs. Let's analyze the occurrences:

- In example 1, the presence of ""walm"" is followed by three yellow outputs.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by two yellows.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by two greens.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by a series of greens (three before ""wif"" and another one after ""dax walm"").
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by two greens.

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" results in repeating the color that directly follows it in the input sequence for the next two outputs, regardless of what that color is. There is one exception to this in example 4, where ""walm"" precedes a series of multiple ""green"" outputs, suggesting that ""walm"" may cause the repetition of the color that follows it until a new color word appears.

"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by identifying patterns related to its position and corresponding output colors. 

Let's analyze each example to see if ""dax"" relates to specific input words or positions:

1. Input: wif (red) walm (red) dax (red) zup (green yellow)
2. Input: lug (blue) dax (green) walm (green)
3. Input: wif (red) lug (blue) dax (green)
4. Input: dax (green) lug (blue) wif (red) walm (red)
5. Input: dax (green) bluf (green) wif (red) lug (blue) zup (yellow)

In examples 2, 3, and 4, ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color green in the output. 

In example 1, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" resulting in multiple colors instead of a single color (in this instance, green yellow). However, based on other examples, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, so we can say that the presence of ""dax"" also seems to produce green.

Example 5 introduces ""bluf"" between ""dax"" and other words, and ""dax"" still results in the color green, while ""bluf"" also translates to green. This complicates the matter slightly because ""bluf"" does not feature in any other provided examples to confirm its color output consistently. However, since ""dax"" produces a green output in different positions in other examples, we can reasonably infer that ""bluf"" does not seem to affect ""dax"" producing green.

Considering all the examples, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

"From the examples given, we can analyze the occurrence of the nonce word ""dax"" and its corresponding color in the output:

- When ""wif walm dax zup"" occurs, the output includes an extra ""red"" before ""green yellow,"" which aligns with ""wif walm.""

- When ""lug dax walm"" occurs, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" to the subsequent ""green green.""

- When ""wif lug dax"" occurs, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" following the pattern of colors assigned to ""wif"" and ""lug.""

- When ""dax lug wif walm"" occurs, ""dax"" is the first color ""green"" in the output, followed by the respective colors for ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm.""

- When ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" occurs, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" in the output with ""green"" before the respective colors for each.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.5557797599124709,92,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we have to look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" and ""walm,"" the output for ""dax"" is red, as in the second word in the output. However, in the second example, ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" and the output is green, which matches ""lug."" This suggests ""dax"" might mirror the color of the word preceding it.

- In the third example, ""dax"" follows ""lug"" again and the output is green once more.

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" leads the sequence and the output for ""dax"" is green, the same as ""lug,"" which follows ""dax"" this time.

- In the last example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is green, but this time it does not correspond to the output color for ""bluf,"" which is green. This suggests that ""dax"" might not simply be taking the color of the following word either.

Given these observations, let's look for a different hypothesis:

- ""dax"" might correspond to a specific color regardless of its position. Looking at all instances where ""dax"" is used, the output color is always green. It doesn't seem to matter what the position of ""dax"" is.

4. Input: wif walm

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif

From these examples, we can notice that each instance of ""walm"" is followed by the colour that was triggered by the preceding word, repeated three times.

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""walm"" leads to three more greens.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the sequence of three yellows occurs.
- In the third, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" again, yielding three greens after a blue associated with ""lug.""
- The fourth shows ""wif"" prior to ""walm,"" and as a result, we get two more reds.
- Finally, in the fifth, each occurrence of ""walm"" follows this pattern based on the colour associated with the word just before it.

"To deduce the meaning or the rule pertaining to the nonce word 'dax,' let's look at each example and find the commonality:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

3. Input: dax lug dax
   Output: green blue green

4. Input: dax lug dax wif dax
   Output: green blue green red green

5. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

By observing the color output sequence with respect to the position of 'dax', the following pattern can be noticed:

- Whenever 'dax' occurs, it is followed by the color green.
- The color preceding 'dax' appears to influence the color output immediately before the green that corresponds to 'dax'.
  - If 'dax' follows 'wif', the output is red.
  - If 'dax' follows 'lug', the output is blue.
  - If 'dax' follows something other than 'wif' or 'lug' (like 'zup'), the preceding color is yellow.

Given that 'dax' consistently results in the color green, and that the word immediately preceding 'dax' influences the color that comes just before green, it seems that 'dax' operates as a trigger for the color green, while also being dependent on the preceding context for the color output just before the green it triggers.

Rule: 'dax' -> triggers the color green in the output, with the preceding color adjusted according to the word immediately before it: red if preceded by 'wif', blue if preceded by 'lug', yellow if preceded by any other word.",-0.07672358530606742,93,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the input and corresponding output patterns:

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- It begins with ""dax"" and ends with ""dax""; only the second ""dax"" is given a different color (red).

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
- The pattern is similar to the first, with the second occurrence of ""dax"" being red again.

Input: dax lug dax
Output: green blue green
- ""lug"" is inserted between two ""dax"" occurrences and is colored blue.

Input: dax lug dax wif dax
Output: green blue green red green
- Again, the second occurrence of ""dax"" results in a red color code; the third ""dax"" goes back to green.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" and while ""zup"" gets a yellow output, ""dax"" stays green.

From these patterns, we can induce the following rules:
- ""dax"" initially elicits a green output but changes to red when it immediately follows certain other words, like ""wif"" or ""lug"" (which themselves elicit other colors).
- However, when ""dax"" appears immediately after ""zup"" it remains green.
- ""dax"" returns to eliciting green when appearing after the word that changed its output to red.

Based on these observations, ""dax"" might indicate a default state or condition that is overridden in specific contexts but reverts back to its default after the overriding condition is no longer in effect.

Rule: dax -> means default state or condition that can be temporarily changed by certain preceding words.",-0.12880535339707858,93,dax
"Based on the examples given, it appears that 'dax' plays a role in changing the output color that follows its mention. The color changes before and after 'dax' do not appear to follow a simple sequence but are influenced by the presence of 'dax' and possibly the words that are placed with it. 

Let's examine the instances of 'dax':

1. When 'dax' appears before 'walm wif' or 'lug', the color that follows is green. However, the second instance of 'dax' following 'wif' results in red, indicating that 'wif' after 'dax' may lead to a different color.
2. When 'dax' is doubled with a word in between ('dax lug dax'), the sequence is green, the color associated with the middle word, and then green again.
3. When 'dax' is at the end preceded by 'lug', 'wif', or another 'dax', it results in green.
4. When 'dax' is preceded by a different word not mentioned before, such as 'zup', it also results in green.

From these examples, it’s difficult to ascertain a consistent rule regarding 'dax' leading to an output of 'green', as it does not always produce green; 'dax' followed by 'wif' produces red. However, the last instance in most cases except when preceded by 'wif' is green.

It's important to note that the context of 'dax' cannot be completely determined from the given examples, as the rules for 'lug,' 'wif,' 'walm,' and 'zup' appear to have their own influence on the output.

Nonetheless, a tentative rule might be drawn as follows:

Rule: When 'dax' appears, it generally leads to a 'green' output unless it is directly followed by 'wif', in which case it leads to 'red'.

dax -> When isolated or at the end, leads to the output 'green'; after 'wif', leads to 'red'.",-0.8259673974067417,93,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""dax,"" let's analyze each instance of ""dax"" in the input and the corresponding output color:

1. In the first input, every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to a green except the one followed by ""wif,"" which turns the output color after it to red. This suggests ""dax"" might cause the next word to turn green, unless it is followed by ""wif,"" which changes the subsequent color to red.

2. In the second input, again ""dax"" leads to a green output. The ""dax"" before ""wif"" again corresponds to red after ""wif."" There is also a ""dax"" following ""lug,"" and that ""dax"" corresponds to green, just like other standalone instances. However, ""lug"" in the input turns the output blue, irrespective of ""dax.""

3. The third input confirms that ""dax"" before and after ""lug"" corresponds to green, with ""lug"" leading to blue.

4. The fourth input again shows that ""dax"" turns the next word green unless interrupted by ""wif,"" which will then cause red. ""lug"" still turns the output blue.

5. In the fifth input, ""zup"" comes before ""dax,"" and the output is yellow then green, which suggests ""zup"" is responsible for the yellow as it is not followed by ""dax.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" makes the next word's output green, unless the following conditions are met: if ""dax"" is followed directly by ""wif,"" the output after ""wif"" is red; ""lug"" has its own rule which is to turn the output to blue; and other words unassociated with ""dax"" follow their own rules, like ""zup"" leading to yellow.

So, the rule for ""dax"" is:

dax -> makes the next item in sequence green, unless followed by the word ""wif,"" in which case the next item after ""wif"" is red.",-0.8934308809049437,93,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" does not have a fixed color representation. Rather, its output color varies with context. However, we can attempt to deduce the rules based on the patterns that emerge in the input-output pairs.

- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning or end of a sequence or is followed by another ""dax"", it corresponds to the color green.
- When ""dax"" is immediately preceded by ""lug"", it also corresponds to the color green.
- When ""dax"" is immediately preceded by ""wif"", it corresponds to the color red.
- The presence of ""lug"" before a ""dax"" that is not immediately after ""wif"" does not affect the output color for ""dax"", which remains green.
- No other word (""walm"", ""zup"") before ""dax"" seems to affect ""dax"" being green except for ""wif"".

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, except when it is immediately preceded by the word ""wif"", in which case it corresponds to the color red.",-0.9305232440825842,93,dax
"Given the examples, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif."" It appears before every other word or pair of items, none of which seem meaningfully related in English, but consistently map to specific colors in the output. Let's examine each case:

Example 1:
Input: wif lug 
Output: red blue 
- ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue.""

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf 
Output: red red 
- ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" which maps to ""red.""

Example 3:
Input: wif bluf lug zup 
Output: red red blue yellow 
- ""wif"" precedes a sequence that includes ""bluf"" (red), ""lug"" (blue), and ""zup"" (yellow).

Example 4:
Input: wif dax bluf 
Output: red green green 
- ""wif"" precedes a sequence that includes ""dax"" (green) followed by ""bluf"" (red, but repeated as green).

Example 5:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup 
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""wif"" precedes a sequence including ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" (unknown, but perhaps ""yellow"" since every unknown word is translated to ""yellow""), ""dax"" (green), and another ""zup"" (yellow).

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" when appearing at the beginning of a sequence, always results in ""red"" at the start of the output. Then every other word in the input after ""wif"" is mapped to a specific color, with ""lug"" being ""blue,"" ""bluf"" being ""red,"" ""zup"" being ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" being ""green."" Any unknown word after ""wif"" has appeared seems to default to ""yellow,"" which could either be part of the rule for ""wif"" or simply a placeholder for unrecognized words.

The rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" signals the start of a sequence where ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and subsequent words are mapped to specific predetermined colors, with unknown words mapping to ""yellow.""",-0.10047821447732894,93,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" is a rule that determines a sequence of color outputs dependent on the input words following ""wif"". Each word after ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color. 

Here is the mapping derived from the examples:

- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" maps to ""red""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""walm"" does not explicitly map to a color in the examples, but given the context, we can infer that it likely maps to ""yellow"", as it is preceded and followed by ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule is that ""wif"" signals the start of a sequence where each word transforms into a specific color based on a set mapping.

Rule: wif -> initiates a sequence where specific words are transformed into predetermined colors.",-1.0016573980175,93,wif
"To deduce the meaning of 'wif', we need to look at the pattern of how it affects the output in relation to the other words in the inputs. By examining the examples:

- Whenever 'wif' is present, 'red' leads the output sequence. 
- 'wif' does not appear to directly translate to 'red', as 'bluf' also generates a 'red' in the output, but has instances of generating 'green' when preceded by 'dax'.
- The presence of 'wif' does not seem to affect the translation of the other words, as their corresponding outputs are consistent irrespective of its presence.

Given the above observations, 'wif' is likely a rule-inducing word that mandates the following color sequence to begin with 'red', and then follows a separate but consistent translation rule for the other words. Other words appear to translate consistently to their own color (for example, 'lug' -> blue, 'bluf' -> red or green based on context, 'zup' -> yellow, 'dax' -> green). It's also possible that 'wif' resets the context for translating the words that follow it.

So, the rule appears to be:

Rule: 'wif' indicates that the following sequence of colors should start with 'red'.",-1.0793581262184213,93,wif
"wif -> triggers the translation of following words into colors based on specific rules. Rule: Each word following ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color based on its inherent characteristics as implied by the examples.

For instance, given the consistent translation in examples:
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

The rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it initiates a sequence where each word after ""wif"" is substituted with a specific color, potentially based on the word's first letter or the entire word itself.

- In every output, the first word is always ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" most likely translates to ""red.""
- The rest of the output sequence does not include ""red"" again, indicating that ""wif"" is not repeated with other words.

Based on these observations, the rule can be formed as:

"Rule: bluf corresponds to the output color that matches the previous color mentioned. 

If we follow this rule:

- In the second example, bluf follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" so bluf also translates to yellow.
- In the third example, bluf follows ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" thus bluf also becomes ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, bluf is between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" which are ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively. Since ""wif"" comes first, bluf translates to ""red"" (the same as ""wif"").
- In the fifth example, bluf follows ""lug"" (blue), so it translates to ""blue,"" matching the preceding color.

Hence, bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf is the color that corresponds to the word immediately proceeding it.",-0.6686431415115583,93,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

When ""bluf"" is encountered, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"". Therefore, in each case, ""bluf"" translates to the color of the preceding word:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", and the corresponding output color for ""dax"" is green, hence ""bluf"" leads to the output ""green"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", and the corresponding output color for ""zup"" is yellow, which means ""bluf"" leads to the output ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", and the corresponding output color for ""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" results in ""blue"".
- The fourth example is slightly more complex as ""bluf"" is followed by another instance of ""zup"", but since we are focusing only on the word that directly precedes ""bluf"", the corresponding output color for ""zup"" is yellow, making ""bluf"" yield ""yellow"".
- The fifth example showcases ""lug"" before ""bluf"" again, consistently translating ""bluf"" to the color ""blue"", the output for ""lug"".

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the preceding word. Each instance of ""walm"" leads to the previous word’s associated color output being repeated three times.

Let's review the examples and deduce the rule:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""zup's"" color is yellow, which is repeated three times.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" here, and ""dax's"" color is green, which is repeated three times, followed by ""wif's"" color, red.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""zup's"" color, yellow, is repeated three times, enclosed by ""lug's"" color, blue, at both ends.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
In this sequence, ""walm"" again follows ""zup,"" and we see that ""zup's"" color, yellow, is repeated three times, with preceding words ""wif"" and ""dax"" having their associated colors, red and green.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
Here, ""walm"" is used twice. Each time it follows ""wif,"" and accordingly, the color red is repeated three times after each ""walm."" Also, after ""zup"" and ""lug,"" we see their respective colors, and at the end, after the last ""walm,"" the color associated with ""zup"" is repeated.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.07585658701554347,93,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's my assessment of the pattern:

- In Example 1 (""zup walm""), ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color yellow to repeat three times.
 
- In Example 2 (""dax walm wif""), ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. The output is ""green green green red,"" which means that ""walm"" caused green, associated with ""dax,"" to repeat three times, and then ""wif"" added red once.

- In Example 3 (""lug zup walm lug""), ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow. The output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times, and ""lug"" outputs blue both before and after.

- In Example 4 (""wif dax zup walm""), ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. The fact that ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow"" implies that ""walm"" is causing ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat.

- In Example 5 (""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup""), ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. The output sequence ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"" indicates that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with ""wif"" first (red, repeating three times), then it doesn't affect ""zup"" or ""lug"" as it does not directly follow them, and finally it triggers a repetition after the second ""wif"" (red, repeating three times) before ""zup"" outputs yellow again.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to repeat three times in the output. 

walm -> repeat the preceding color three times.",-0.08182490777385866,93,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm appears to correspond to the repetition of the color word that directly precedes it in the Input. It is as if ""walm"" means ""repeat the previous color word"". Here is how it applies to the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which means that ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- In the second example, ""dax"" becomes ""green,"" and then ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" repeating ""green"" three times before ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and thus ""walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" and repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" twice and each time, ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" before ""walm"", hence the repetition of ""red"" three times in a row.

The word ""wif"" seems to introduce a pattern in which the preceding color word's output is repeated by a ratio of 1:2 - for every occurrence of a color term that precedes ""wif"", you would output that color once followed by ""red"" twice.

Let's check it with the available examples:

- In ""zup wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so we get ""yellow"" followed by ""red"" repeated once as there is one ""zup.""
- In ""lug zup dax wif"", we have ""lug"" (blue), ""zup"" (yellow), and ""dax"" (green). So each of them is followed by ""red"" repeated once each: ""blue yellow green red"".
- In ""dax walm wif walm"", since ""walm"" does not have a corresponding color and it appears twofold after a ""wif"", it seems to triple the sequence of ""green"" and doubles the sequence of ""red"" because of the two occurrences of ""walm"" after ""wif"".
- We have ""zup wif"" again as the fourth example, and it yields the same output as the first example.
- Finally, in ""dax bluf wif lug zup"", we see that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green"", and since ""bluf"" also precedes ""wif"", we get ""green green red"" for both ""dax"" and ""bluf"", followed by ""blue yellow"" for ""lug"" and ""zup"".

If we weave these observations together, it looks like ""wif"" causes duplication of the word ""red"" following each color term that occurred in the input before ""wif."" 

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> For each color word before ""wif"", output that color once followed by the word ""red"" twice. If a non-color word follows ""wif"", replicate the prior sequence based on the number of times the non-color word occurs.",-0.31248028199445,94,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look at the patterns in the input and output pairs. The word ""wif"" appears in every input, and the word ""red"" appears in every output. So, we could assume that ""wif"" translates to ""red."" However, the presence, position and repetition of other words also affect the output.

Let's analyze the appearances:

1. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
2. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
3. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.

Another point:
- Repetition of words in the input leads to repetition in the output, as seen in the third input-output pair where ""walm"" is repeated twice and ""green red"" is repeated twice in the output.

From these observations, we can induce the following:

- Each unique word before ""wif"" in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output.
- The output colors follow the same order as their corresponding input words.
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" at the end of each output sequence.

Given this, we can make the rule:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" Since ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green,"" and ""dax bluf"" results in a repetition of ""green,"" this suggests that ""bluf"" may imply a repetition or duplication of the preceding color word's output.

2. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" We see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The ""bluf"" following ""zup"" results in the repetition of ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup.""

3. ""zup wif bluf"" yields ""yellow red red."" The presence of ""bluf"" after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" results in a repeated ""red.""

4. ""zup lug bluf"" turns into ""yellow blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" after ""lug"" (which means ""blue"") again causes a repetition of ""blue.""

5. In ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" the output is ""blue red red blue red."" After ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" causes a repetition of ""red"" once again.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" results in the duplication or repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color word that comes before it.",-0.10163576864593594,94,bluf
"From the examples provided, it can be observed that the output always includes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"". Thus, we can induce the following rule:

The word ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Here is the line-by-line analysis:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
2. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
3. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
4. Input: zup lug bluf -> Output: yellow blue blue

Therefore, the rule is:

"Rule: bluf corresponds to repeating the color of the word that immediately follows it. 

Evidence:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" suggests bluf repeats the color associated with dax, which is green.
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue green blue""; the color after bluf is yellow, hence the repeated ""yellow"" for bluf.
- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""; bluf repeats the color red, which follows it.
- ""zup lug bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue""; bluf repeats the color blue, which is the color of lug.
- ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red""; again, bluf repeats the color red, which follows it.

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the following word.",-0.12470661217461544,94,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the appearance of the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the output of two identical colors following it. The color that is outputted matches the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Here are the observed patterns:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word twice.",-1.0600415008334614,94,bluf

"The examples show a consistent pattern that allows us to figure out what ""walm"" might mean:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color mentioned before it three times.

For example:
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (since ""zup"" means ""yellow"")
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" includes ""lug walm"" right after ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color word before it three times. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, output the corresponding color three times.",-0.08703437476127907,94,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the consistent patterns associated with this nonce word in the input-output pairs:

- Whenever ""walm"" is present, the output ends with the same color word repeated.

- The repetition of color words corresponds to the number of times the word ""lug"" appears before ""walm.""

Let's test this hypothesis with the given examples:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to a single color, ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" follows it, and there are no occurrences of ""lug,"" there are three repetitions of ""yellow.""

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which appears once before ""walm,"" thus we have ""blue"" repeated three times after that. ""wif"" does not affect the repetition.

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""lug"" appears twice before ""walm""; therefore, when ""walm"" occurs, we expect ""red"" to be repeated three times (the output associated with ""lug"" after including the first instance of ""red"").

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - This is the same as the first example, thus still applicable.

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" appears once before ""walm,"" which leads to the color ""red"" being repeated three times.

Based on the examples and the identified pattern, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to ""lug"" to be repeated three times at the end of the output. Therefore:

walm -> The word ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times as ""red"" in the output. If ""lug"" does not precede ""walm,"" then the color before ""walm"" is repeated three times. 

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a tripling of the color word associated with the word ""lug"" if it appears before ""walm,"" otherwise it triples the color of the word immediately before ""walm.""",-0.10270115645581399,94,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each instance where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, the output is a series of reds.
- The number of reds after ""walm"" seems to equal the number of ""lug""s that come before it in the same sequence.

Here are the observations broken down:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" turns into ""yellow,"" no lugs before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" does not contribute to the output.
   
2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red"" or ""yellow"" based on the preceding word, and one ""lug"" before ""walm"" corresponds to one ""red.""

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - A series of words map to their respective colors, but importantly, two ""lug""s appear before ""walm,"" resulting in two ""red"" in the output.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Same as the first input/output pair, ""walm"" does not add any reds because there are no ""lug""s before it.

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - One ""lug"" before ""walm"" gives us three ""red"" in the output.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat ""red"" according to the amount of ""lug"" that appeared before it in the sequence. If there are no ""lug"" words prior to ""walm,"" there are no reds in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the word ""red"" for each instance of the word ""lug"" that appears before ""walm"" in the sequence. If there are no ""lug""s before ""walm,"" ""walm"" has no output.",-0.10709164074546512,94,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the most recently mentioned color. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be three. To confirm this rule, let's examine the instances where ""walm"" occurs:

In the first and fourth examples:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

The color ""yellow"" from ""zup"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".

In the second example:
Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Here, the color ""blue"" from ""lug"" is repeated three times after ""walm"", before it changes to ""red"" and ""yellow"" with new input words ""wif"" and ""zup"".

In the third example:
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Before ""walm"" is mentioned, ""red"" is the last color output mentioned (from ""wif""), and ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times.

In the fifth example:
Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Again, before ""walm"", ""red"" is the last color output mentioned (from ""wif""), so ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the most recently mentioned color three times.",-0.1595139590854302,94,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a sequence of ""red"" in the output. However, closer examination suggests that the number of ""red"" in the sequence depends on the preceding words. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to output a repetitive sequence of ""red"" with the quantity determined by the immediate preceding word. Here are the observed patterns:

- When ""walm"" comes after ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- When ""walm"" comes after ""lug wif"", the output is ""red red red"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" does not directly appear, so we have no direct output to associate.
- In the fourth example, it repeats the first example, where ""walm"" follows ""zup"", producing ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug wif"", the output is again ""red red red"".

This pattern seems consistent with the word ""walm"" needing a preceding pattern to determine its output. However, the correlation is not one-to-one considering ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" in the third example does not correlate with a specific output, suggesting that ""lug wif"" as a pair triggers the sequence of ""red"", while ""walm"" may not have a fixed meaning and act more like a placeholder that takes on a value contingent on the previous word or words.

To summarize:

walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" varies depending on the preceding words, often resulting in a sequence of colors, specifically reds after ""lug wif"". In the absence of a clear and consistent behavior of ""walm"" when following other words, we need more examples to accurately determine a rule for this nonce word.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the provided examples.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - Here, ""dax"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""green."" After ""zup"" comes the sequence ""yellow blue.""

2. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   - ""dax"" is ""green"" again, but ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

3. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - Directly after ""zup"" comes ""yellow blue.""

4. Input: zup dax

   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is ""green."" Post ""zup,"" the pattern ""yellow"" repeats the number of times ""walm"" appears.

From the examples above, it is apparent that when ""zup"" appears, the color that is generated is ""yellow,"" followed by a sequence dependent on the word that comes after ""zup.""

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" may be that it signals a change in the sequence; specifically, it introduces the color ""yellow"" and potentially sets a pattern for following words.

Rule: ""zup"" -> introduces the color ""yellow,"" followed by a pattern that seems to depend on the subsequent words.",-0.09365817633729727,95,zup
"Analyzing the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word “zup” by examining its position and corresponding output colors:

1. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
2. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
3. zup lug -> yellow blue
4. zup dax -> yellow green
5. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

From the examples, we notice that ""zup"" always results in the output of the color yellow. We can also notice that the words following ""zup"" correspond to different colors in the output, which suggests that ""zup"" alone does not determine the color of these following words.

Now, looking at the instances where ""zup"" is followed by another word:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output color is blue (Examples 1, 3).
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color is green (Example 4).
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output color is yellow (Example 5).

The outputs after ""zup"" seem to be consistent with the colors corresponding to the words if they were placed at the beginning of the input:

- ""lug"" is blue (Example 3 and 5).
- ""dax"" is green (Examples 1 and 4). 
- ""walm"" is blue as a standalone and beginnings of sequences but yellow when it comes after ""zup"" (Examples 1 and 5).

The word ""zup"" does not change the colors following it to yellow. Instead, it seems to be a marker that indicates to output the color yellow and the next words follow their usual color coding.

To sum up, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" generates the color yellow and does not influence the color of the words that come after it.

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is encountered in the input, the color yellow is outputted, and the following words are outputted in their respective colors as if ""zup"" was not there.",-0.10440734847513514,95,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" is responsible for repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Each instance of ""zup"" creates a repetition series for the color represented by the word right before ""zup"":

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue."" Here, ""walm"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""zup"" causes ""green"" to repeat twice more before proceeding to the color for ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

2. ""dax bluf zup"" comes out as ""green green yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" translates to yellow, and ""zup"" repeats that color once.

3. ""zup lug"" yields ""yellow blue."" Since there is no word before ""zup,"" it seems that ""zup"" defaults to ""yellow"" when not following a color word.

4. ""zup dax"" converts to ""yellow green."" ""Dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""zup"" doesn't have a word before it to repeat, so it again defaults to ""yellow.""

5. ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" represents ""green,"" but ""zup"" follows ""walm"" causing the color to repeat twice as ""yellow.""

From the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""zup"" follows a word associated with a color, it repeats the color output of the preceding word. If ""zup"" is the first word or not immediately following a color word, it defaults to ""yellow.""

"Given the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules for the word ""zup"":

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
3. ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Now we will look at the use of ""zup"" across these examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug"", the output is ""green green green yellow blue"". Since we know that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"", the ""zup"" here translates to an additional ""green"" followed by the color of the following word, ""blue"".
  
- In the second example, ""dax bluf zup"", the output is ""green green yellow"". Since there is no ""bluf"" in the remaining examples, we can assume that it is irrelevant or a misprint, the important observation is that ""zup"" translates to ""green yellow"".

- In the third and fourth examples, ""zup"" appears at the beginning and translates to ""yellow"" followed by the color corresponding to the following word: ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""green"" for ""dax"".

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". We see that ""zup"" after ""walm"" yields an additional ""blue"" followed by ""yellow"".

From the above, we can deduce that ""zup"" might mean to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word and then to present the color corresponding to the next word. However, as we look for consistency, there is a particular pattern where ""zup"" seems to always relate to the color ""yellow"" when it is the first word or following the word ""bluf"". If we consider the possibility of ""bluf"" being a misprint and ignore its output, the consistent rule with ""zup"" would be the repetition of the previous color followed by ""yellow"".

Since we have the fifth example, which doesn't fit this exact pattern (since ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and translates to an additional ""blue"" instead of ""yellow""), the rule needs to accommodate both observed patterns. A possible rule synthesizing both patterns could be that ""zup"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it when it's in the middle or end of a sequence, but defaults to ""yellow"" when it starts a sequence or follows an unknown word like ""bluf"".

"To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples:

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Now, let's examine the outputs where ""walm"" appears:

In example 1, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue"". Then it appears after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". 

In example 2, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and the output is again ""blue blue"".

In example 3, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and the output is ""green green"".

In example 4, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

In example 5, ""walm"" appears on its own after ""zup"" and the output is once again ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Examining the contexts in which ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output colors, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word thrice. 

For example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"". Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". And ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", making ""dax walm"" output ""green green green"".

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: zup walm

There is a pattern in which the appearance of ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color mentioned just before it. For example:

- In the first input, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second, ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third, ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green.""
- In the fourth, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup walm"" again results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

   - The word ""lug"" before ""walm"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" we see blue repeated.
   - The word ""zup"" before the second ""walm"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" we see yellow repeated three times.

2. Input: dax lug walm

1. ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green""
   Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" must translate to ""green.""

2. ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
   In this example, ""dax"" translates to three ""green"" outputs. ""Walm"" followed by ""zup"" and then another ""walm"" translates to three ""yellow"" outputs each.

3. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green""

- wif walm dax -> red red red green

However, the number of times ""walm"" appears before ""dax"" or ""wif"" indeed influences how many reds appear before the green.

From these observations, we can deduce that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes right before it:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with a change in the color output. To discern a pattern, let's look at the corresponding output for each instance of ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif,"" but it corresponds to ""blue"" when followed by ""lug.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" by itself following ""wif"" results in ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears at the end and results in ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears at the end after a sequence and results in ""yellow.""

From examining the instances, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent corresponding output color by itself but may instead reflect some rule contingent on the surrounding words or the sequence of words.

Given the varying results produced by ""bluf,"" it seems that there might not be enough data to establish a concrete, consistent rule. Still, we can make a tentative rule based on the limited information:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" may be influenced by its position in the sequence and possibly by the words immediately preceding and following it. ""Bluf"" followed by ""lug"" tends to result in ""blue,"" while ""bluf"" followed by ""wif"" results in ""red."" When ""bluf"" is at the end, it's either ""blue"" or ""yellow,"" potentially depending on the previous colors or words in the sequence.",-1.1627896109091664,96,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it's after ""dax"" or ""blue"" otherwise. So we have the following correspondences:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" which gives us ""green"", but the second ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""dax"", it gives ""blue"".
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and it gives us ""red"".
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again and produces ""red"".
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" occurs after a sequence of words with no ""dax"" immediately before it, leading to ""yellow"".

However, examining these mappings points to an inconsistency – particularly in the second and third examples where ""bluf"" following ""wif"" is paired with ""red"", which contradicts the mapping from ""bluf"" to ""blue"" when not preceded by ""dax"".

After a closer inspection, we can notice that ""bluf"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" at the end of an output sequence, suggesting the possibility of position-based inference for ""bluf"". However, this is not enough to explain all cases, especially the fourth example where ""bluf"" is the last word in the input but translates as ""blue"" in the output, not ""yellow"".

Given that there is an inconsistency and ambiguity in the translation of ""bluf"", alongside an insufficient number of examples to establish a comprehensive and unambiguous rule, the conclusions one can draw are speculative. The provided examples suggest ""bluf"" usually translates to either ""blue"" or ""yellow,"" but the rule is not wholly clear.

The more consistent rule we can extract is:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it means ""green."" Otherwise, it is likely to mean ""blue,"" but may be context dependent.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the examples given:

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

By analyzing the examples:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is green green green.
- The color that precedes ""walm"" repeats 3 times in the output.
- Directly after ""walm,"" the color associated with the next word in the input is the color in the output.
- ""walm"" does not seem to generate its own unique color; instead, it causes the previous color to repeat thrice and then continues with the subsequent color.

Whether ""walm"" is before or after the color word doesn’t change the output.

For instance:

- ""dax walm zup"" generates ""green green green yellow,"" where ""green"" is the color for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red,"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- When ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence following ""wif,"" as in ""wif walm,"" the color ""red"" repeats three times.
- When ""walm"" is used in other contexts, the pattern still holds, as seen in ""lug zup walm lug"", which results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" with ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" and the sequence ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""zup walm lug.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Walm causes the previous color word to be repeated three times in the output, followed by the color associated with the next word (if there's one following it).

- In the third example: ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""
- In the fourth example: ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red.""
- In the fifth example: ""lug walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red.""

Analyzing the patterns, we can see that each time the word ""walm"" appears, the words before it are repeated in the output with the same color. This suggests that the word ""walm"" may indicate to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding word's associated color to repeat for the number of times ""walm"" is said.

Applying the rule:

- In the first example: ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" follows, so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example: ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" follows after a ""zup,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated, and then ""lug"" appears again, so the sequence ends with ""blue.""
- In the third example: ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" follows, so ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example: ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" with red, and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the fifth example: ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" follows, so ""blue"" is repeated three times, followed by ""wif,"" which is associated with red.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned.",-0.12535684472764477,96,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" influences the color output in a particular way. Here's the deduced rule based on the patterns observed:

- In the presence of ""walm,"" the color before ""walm"" is repeated for the number of words following ""walm,"" including ""walm"" itself.
- The first instance of ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - ""dax"" gives green, ""walm"" repeats the green for itself and the following word ""zup.""

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" gives blue, ""zup"" gives yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow for itself and the following ""lug.""

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" gives red, ""walm"" repeats the red for itself and that's the end of the output.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" gives yellow, ""wif"" gives red, and ""walm"" repeats red for itself.

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - ""lug"" gives blue, ""walm"" repeats blue for itself and the following word ""wif."" 

Given these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the word before it and repeats that color as the output for the number of words following it, including itself.

This rule also explains why we don't see ""walm"" at the very beginning of any input — the rule requires a preceding word to determine its color.",-0.15746202723526323,96,walm
"Analyzing the given data, the output color appears to be dependent on the presence and position of the nonce word ""walm"" as well as the other words in the input sequence. Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

1. In the first input, ""dax walm zup,"" we see ""green green green yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" may turn the color preceding it to green and that ""zup"" afterward translates to yellow. 

2. In the second input, ""lug zup walm lug,"" the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" translates to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and when ""walm"" follows, it repeats the color of the word preceding ""zup.""

3. The third and fourth examples, ""wif walm"" and ""zup wif walm,"" the presence of ""walm"" following ""wif"" translates to repeating the color red multiple times. In the fourth example, ""zup"" translates to yellow.

4. The fifth example, ""lug walm wif,"" gives us ""blue blue blue red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" makes the following word's color repeat.

Based on the given examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the color of the preceding word to repeat for the length of ""walm,"" unless the last word is different, in which case it has its own color. Therefore, ""walm"" functions as a repeater for the previous word's color.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to repeat until a different word with its own color appears. If no different word follows, the repetition continues through the end of the sequence.",-0.18033588299889472,96,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to establish a relationship between its occurrences and the colors given in the output. From the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green yellow.""

2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""

3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""

4. When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" in the input, the output repeats the color that corresponds to ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

5. When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" in the input, the output repeats the color that corresponds to ""wif"" which is ""red.""

From these patterns, we can observe that the appearances of ""walm"" always produce a threefold repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, followed by a different color when there's a subsequent word. The exceptional color could be due to ""walm"" or the interaction between ""walm"" and the following word.

Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""walm"" in the context appears to trigger a repetition of the color of the preceding word three times.

The other words appear to be associated with consistent colors:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> yellow (except when followed by ""wif"")

When ""wif"" follows any word, the output color is ""red."" There is not enough information to identify a secondary pattern (such as when ""wif"" stands alone, as it also results in ""red""). Therefore, the best rule that can be determined from the given data is:

From the provided cases:

1. ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
2. ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
3. ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow."" However, the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"" except when preceded by ""wif,"" where it transitions to ""red.""

"To identify the meaning or rule of the nonce word 'walm', we must look for patterns in the provided examples that include the word 'walm' and the resultant outputs.

We can start by breaking down the first example:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

In this example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'. Since 'bluf' results in 'blue', we can infer it is likely a misspelling or variation of 'lug'. This would make 'walm' correspond to three instances of 'blue'.

Let's check the second example:

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'lug' to 'blue'. Following 'lug', we see 'walm' and in the output, we have three instances of 'blue'. This adheres to the pattern we saw from example 1.

Now, let's check the third example:

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

Based on previous examples, 'wif' is 'red', 'lug' and 'bluf' are 'blue'. The word 'walm' correlates with two instances of 'red' in this example. This seems to be a deviation from the first two examples.

Moving on to the fourth example:

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

Here, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'wif' to 'red', 'dax' to 'green', and 'zup' to 'yellow'. 'walm' precedes 'zup' and corresponds to two instances of 'green' followed by 'yellow'. This does not match the prior association of 'walm' with 'blue' or 'red'.

Lastly, let's examine the fifth example:

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

This example is identical to the second example and yields the same result, with 'walm' corresponding to three 'blue'.

Based on these observations, we can see that 'walm' appears to introduce repetition. However, the number of repetitions and color it produces is not consistent across the examples. To establish a definitive rule from these inconsistent examples is challenging, but there is a pattern of repetition and color association.

Examining more closely, it seems that 'walm' might be triggering a repetition of the color that comes right after 'walm' in the input sequence. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of 'walm' appearances plus one. This theory is consistent with examples one, two, and five but not with three and four.

If we account for potential errors in examples three and four, we might conclude the following tentative rule:

Rule: 'walm' causes the next color word to repeat three times.

However, given the inconsistencies, more examples or information would be needed to solidify this rule. For now:

walm -> causes the next color to repeat multiple times (potentially three times based on consistent examples).",-0.07962157979727275,97,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its usage in the examples provided and the corresponding outputs:

1. lug walm wif lug bluf

2. zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

3. wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

4. lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

5. zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

The word ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" and before ""wif"" and ""lug."" If we look closely at the surrounding words, ""lug"" corresponds to 'blue,' ""wif"" to 'red,' ""zup"" to 'yellow,' and ""bluf"" to a variation of 'blue' (presumably 'red'). The common pattern is that following ""walm,"" a color is repeated multiple times based on a certain rule.

Here are the color repetitions after ""walm"":

- After ""lug walm wif"" -> blue blue blue
- After ""zup lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
- After ""wif walm lug"" -> red red red
- In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" it is less clear, but ""green"" repeats three times.

The repetitions seem to be based on the color word that comes immediately after ""walm."" When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times, and when it is followed by ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times. In the last example, where ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" it is not immediately clear if the repetition is related to ""zup"" since there are other color words after ""walm,"" but the pattern of repetition is still present with three greens.

The clearest rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: After word ""walm,"" the color word that directly follows is repeated three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" according to the rule can be described as a command for repetition, indicating that the following color word should be repeated three times.

   Analysis: ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue."" The term ""walm"" appears between blue (""lug"") and red (""wif"") multiple times, which might suggest it also translates to ""blue.""

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" again appears to translate to ""blue,"" and following the previous logic, ""walm"" likely translates to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Analysis: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" and ""bluf"" both to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" comes immediately after ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and it also translates to ""red"" in this output.

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Analysis: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Given that ""walm"" follows ""green"" (""dax"") and the output is ""green"" twice more, it suggests ""walm"" might translate to ""green"" in this context.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: This example is identical to number 2 and the output remains consistent with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" supporting the hypothesis that ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" here.

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. That is, if the previous word is ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" translates to ""blue""; if it's ""wif"" (red), then ""walm"" is ""red"", and if it's ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" translates to ""green"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the inputs and the corresponding outputs in each example, focusing on the appearance of ""walm"" and its translation in the output sequence.

From example 1:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""wif lug"", and the corresponding output is three ""blue"" followed by one ""red"" and then two more ""blue"". Since ""walm"" is not directly translated into an output color and the ""lug"" that appears both before and after ""walm,"" we can safely assume for now that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The sequence of three ""blue"" might suggest repetition, amplification, or some form of intensification associated with ""walm"".

From example 2:
Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
- Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again, and we see an additional ""blue"" following the ""blue"" that corresponds with ""lug"". This further supports that ""walm"" causes some form of repetition or continuation of the previous color.

From example 3:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- The sequence begins with ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" ""Walm"" directly follows and the output shows a repetition of ""red"" before moving on to new colors with new words. This indicates that ""walm"" again causes repetition.

From example 4:
Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- In this example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and we see a repetition of ""green"" in the output. This consistency across examples affirms the role of ""walm"" in repetition.

"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the pattern of outputs in relation to the inputs where ""wif"" appears:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
2. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
   
3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
4. Input: dax zup dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow green yellow red
   
Looking at these examples, we see that regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""wif"" always results in ""red"" in the output sequence. Additionally, observing the other words, it seems that:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""walm"" correlates with ""red""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- The position of ""bluf"" in the second example does not affect the color that precedes it.

We can conclude that the word ""wif,"" when used within this sequence of inputs, always corresponds to the output ""red,"" independent of sequence position or surrounding words.

- In the second example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""wif"" once again translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" to ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the pattern for other words is ""green, yellow, green, yellow.""

- In the fifth example, which is identical to the third, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" to ""red.""

The rule that can be deduced from the given examples is that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

- In ""dax wif bluf"", ""dax"" is green and ""wif"" is red. So ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"", resulting in ""green red red"".
- In ""wif bluf lug dax wif"", ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" after it is also red. ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, and the last ""wif"" is red.
- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" following it is also green, making it ""green green"".

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

"The examples provided suggest a pattern where the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Each preceding word seems to have a corresponding color:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Following this pattern:

- ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green"". The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, so the output is ""green"" repeated three times after the initial ""red blue green.""
  
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". The word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and thus the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
  
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
  
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" is slightly irregular as ""bluf"" doesn't have a consistent output, but following ""wif"" which outputs red, ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".
  
- ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" so it repeats the color green three times, and then the sequence ends with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow.

Combining these insights, we get:

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" does not translate to a fixed color, but rather to a repetition of the preceding color mentioned in the input. Each example shows ""walm"" following a word that can be linked to a color, and the output is that color repeated three times.

Here are the mappings from the input to the output:
- ""lug dax walm"" -> blue green green green green, where ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" repeats the green three times.
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow, where ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""walm"" repeats the yellow three times.
- ""dax walm"" -> green green green, where ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> yellow yellow red red red, where ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" has no direct translation in the output, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats the red three times.
- ""dax walm zup"" -> green green green yellow, where ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" repeats the green three times, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, which comes after ""walm"".

In the outputs, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""Walm"" takes the color of the word before it and repeats it three times.

- In the first example, ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm"", which results in three greens.
- The second example does not have a preceding color word, but since the output is three yellows, it can be inferred that ""zup"" means yellow. ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" creating three yellows.
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" gives us three greens once again, reinforcing the rule.
- The fourth example starts with ""zup"" (yellow) and moves to ""bluf"" (unassigned, but the pattern breaks here as no repetition follows it), then ""wif"" (red), followed by ""walm"", resulting in three reds.
- The fifth example has ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" and then ""zup"", which demonstrates ""walm"" causing three greens after ""dax"" (green) and then transitioning to the color corresponding to ""zup"" (yellow).

In summary:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.6142674092303846,98,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated output of the color that precedes it. Here are the observations leading to this conclusion:

1. When preceded by ""lug dax"", which correspond to the colors red and blue, with blue being the last, the output is ""green green green"", indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" is causing the repetition of ""green"" three times.

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" which on its own produces ""yellow,"" the output is a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.

3. This pattern is again seen with ""dax"" preceding ""walm,"" leading to ""green"" being repeated three times.

4. When ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" which on its own produces ""red,"" the output following ""walm"" is ""red"" repeated three times.

5. Finally, ""dax walm zup"" gives us ""green green green yellow,"" once more showing that the color directly preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times, and then the pattern goes on to the next color, which corresponds to ""zup.""

From these observations, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color corresponding to the word directly before it to be repeated three times. If there are words after ""walm,"" their corresponding colors will follow the repeated colors without additional repetition.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next color to be repeated three times, or if a color isn't given following ""walm"", it repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"", also three times.",-0.30289314928884625,99,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we need to examine the color pattern outputs in relation to the given inputs and specifically how they change when ""walm"" is introduced.

Let's break down the occurrences:

1. In the presence of ""wif"" and ""walm"", the output is three ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to the other word.
2. With ""wif walm dax"", the output is three ""red"" followed by ""green"", suggesting ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", we observe three instances of the color associated with ""zup"" (""yellow""), indicating that ""walm"" possibly multiplies the color output related to the word preceding it.
4. ""zup dax walm"" gives us four ""green"", which, based on previous deductions, implies that ""walm"" again seems to be yielding three extra instances of the color that ""dax"" corresponds to (""green"").
5. ""zup wif walm"" results in three additional ""red"" colors following the ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""zup"". This reinforces our assumption that ""walm"" multiplies the color output of the word following it.

Based on the above, we can gather the following rule:

walm -> meaning: It appears that ""walm"" causes the output to be three additional instances of the color associated with the word that follows ""walm"". 

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes a word, the color corresponding to that word is output three additional times.",-0.8806029551307696,99,walm

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that:

- The input ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears alongside other nonce words, it still results in the output ""green,"" but the addition of other words corresponds to additional colors. For example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" is mentioned, the output starts with ""red.""

Now let's verify this rule across all the examples:

1. Input: zup dax zup wif
   Output: yellow green yellow red
   
   Here the word ""wif"" appears at the end of the sequence and the last color is ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   
   The word ""wif"" is at the beginning here, and the output starts with ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
   ""wif"" at the beginning corresponds to a ""red"" at the beginning of the output again.

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   
   Here, ""wif"" leads to ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

- When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
- When ""walm"" is present, the output contains ""yellow"" (and the quantity of ""yellow"" in the output seems to match the number of ""walm"" in the input).
- For ""lug,"" the output is ""blue,"" and therefore, ""lug"" likely means ""blue.""

"Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""bluf"" is translated into a color, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule that dictates what ""bluf"" corresponds to.

Here's the analysis of each input and its output:

1. dax wif bluf -> green red red
2. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

Looking at these examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to always result in the color ""red"". However, there's one example that does not fit this pattern exactly:

- Example 2: wif bluf lug -> red red blue

In this example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", not ""bluf"". Therefore, we cannot state a rule that ""bluf"" translates directly to a fixed color since it does not hold true in all instances. Instead, let's examine if ""bluf"" may signify a transition or a change in pattern.

Looking closely, we can see that ""bluf"" is always associated with changing the previous color mentioned:

1. dax (green) wif (red) bluf (red)
2. wif (red) bluf (red) lug (blue)
3. wif (red) bluf (red) dax (green)
4. zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) wif (red) walm (red)
5. dax (green) zup (yellow) bluf (yellow)

However, the pattern does not remain consistent, as ""bluf"" does not always repeat the color that precedes it, nor does it always introduce a new color following it.

Given the lack of a consistent pattern that relates ""bluf"" to a specific color or to an action like repeating or changing the preceding color, it is difficult to establish a definitive meaning or rule for ""bluf"" based on the provided examples. One possibility is that ""bluf"" introduces the first color that appeared in the sequence, but there is not enough data to confirm this, especially since the third and fifth examples suggest otherwise.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is indeterminate given the current information. If there is a specific logic or rule behind this nonce word, additional data or examples would be required to accurately deduce it.

Rule: Indeterminate based on the provided examples. More data is required.",-0.08671902564758441,100,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

1. Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red
2. Input: wif bluf lug | Output: red red blue
3. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
4. Input: zup bluf wif walm | Output: yellow yellow red red red
5. Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow

From examples 1, 2, and 3, we can see that when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the color red is associated with ""bluf"".

From example 4, it seems that ""bluf"" following ""zup"" results in ""yellow."" 

In example 5, it is also interesting to note that ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup"", and before ""dax"" and the output associated with ""bluf"" is yellow.

Considering this information, it seems that ""bluf"" may take the color of the word that precedes it (if the association is consistent with other examples). However, from the initial examples, we could also have thought that ""bluf"" might simply map to the color red, but this is challenged by the fourth and fifth examples, where ""bluf"" maps to yellow. Thus, it's reasonable to deduce that the word before ""bluf"" affects its output.

Therefore, the rule might be:

Rule: ""bluf"" reflects the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Consequently:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""bluf"" takes the output color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the output color is red; if the word is ""zup,"" the output color is yellow.",-0.14345834517419487,100,bluf
"Based on the examples given, we can see that the output is a sequence of color words (red, green, blue, yellow). To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to look at the examples and identify the pattern associated with ""bluf"" and the corresponding color output.

Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow

Let's look at the position of ""bluf"" and the colors that correspond to it:

1. In the first and third examples, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and ""wif,"" respectively, and both times ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug."" In this instance, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
3. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.
4. In the last example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and ""dax."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.

From these observations, we can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red when it follows ""wif"" and corresponds to the color yellow when it follows ""zup"". When it's adjacent to ""dax,"" it takes on the color that ""dax"" corresponds to, which in the two instances provided, is green and yellow.

However, we also observe that the order of words impacts the colors as well. For example, ""dax"" results in ""green"" when it is the first word but ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup."" Similarly, ""wif"" leads to ""red"" but is influenced by the words preceding it.

Given the information, and without more examples to refine the rule, especially cases where ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""wif"" or ""zup,"" the best we can infer is a tentative rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it, with ""wif"" resulting in red and ""zup"" resulting in yellow.

However, please note that this rule is tentative and may have exceptions or be refined with additional examples that isolate the behavior of ""bluf"" under different conditions.",-0.18346703213402588,100,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This conclusion stems from observing that the output is consistent when ""bluf"" is present in the input, regardless of its position or the other words around it. Here's the breakdown:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" translates to red alongside different words (""dax"" translating to green, ""wif"" to red).
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is still red, although it's flanked by ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue).
- Example 4 has ""wif"" (red) and ""walm,"" with each instance of these words being followed by the color red. ""Bluf"" seems to be in this pattern as well, translating to red.
- Example 5 has ""dax"" and ""zup"" translating to green and yellow, respectively, with ""bluf"" yielding yellow; however, seeing as ""zup"" immediately precedes ""bluf,"" it is possible that ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" as a pair, still allowing ""bluf"" to stand for red when isolated.

Considering these observations and the fact that the output only involves colors, we can establish the following:

Rule: bluf -> red.",-0.5428557899663634,100,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to a color pattern that is dependent on the preceding word. Here are the observations:

- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is red.
- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is green.
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to a color that depends on the word immediately before it:
- ""wif bluf"" -> red
- ""dax bluf"" -> green
- ""zup bluf"" -> yellow

Thus, we can define ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the preceding word, following the rule: after ""wif"" it means red, after ""dax"" it means green, and after ""zup"" it means yellow.",-1.1376515810284415,100,bluf
"To deduce the rule for ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples.

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears twice; its corresponding color also appears twice, suggesting replication. ""Red"" follows ""walm"" both times.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and three ""red""s follow, meaning ""walm"" could involve the repetition of the color corresponding to ""wif.""

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Analysis: Adding ""lug"" at the end introduces ""blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" is independent of ""walm."" ""Walm"" continues to cause the color associated with ""wif"" to repeat three times.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Analysis: ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" again repeating ""red"" three times. The placement of ""walm"" appears to be independent of its rule, as the repeated color corresponds to the word directly preceding ""walm.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: Here, ""walm"" is at the end, and ""blue"" repeats three times. The color that ""walm"" causes to be repeated three times correlates with the word right before it (""lug"" -> ""blue"").

Based on the analysis, ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the directly preceding word to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times.",-0.07869212632795698,100,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider the pattern of colors in the outputs relative to the position and repetition of ""walm"" in the inputs.

In each output, the color ""red"" seems to repeat a number of times after ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, suggesting that ""walm"" may indicate a repetition based on some condition.

Let's analyze each instance:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   ""Walm"" appears after ""dax"" and ""wif."" Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" in the output, so ""walm"" might be signaling a triplicate repetition of ""red.""

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" and there are three ""red"" in the output sequence, again suggesting a triplicate repetition.

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   ""Lug"" is added after ""walm,"" which is then represented by ""blue"" after the triplicate ""red"" sequence. This continues to support the triplication rule.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""Walm"" is followed by three ""red"" again, reinforcing the idea of triplication. ""Dax"" then corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   The last ""walm"" results in a triplication of ""blue"" at the end of the sequence.

Seeing this consistent pattern, it seems that:

Walm -> The meaning is to repeat the subsequent color three times in the output.

Rule: When ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, the color that follows ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is the last word, repeat the last color mentioned before it.",-0.08536229504827958,100,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to influence the number of times the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it in the input is repeated in the output. To deduce the rule, let's look at the examples individually:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green,"" but when it is followed by ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.
   - Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" but when followed by ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue"" at the end.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to a single ""blue,"" but ""walm"" at the end results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

From these examples, we can infer the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.

So, walm -> Triplicates the preceding color in the output sequence.",-0.08867523452462366,100,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern between the inputs and outputs:

1. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
   - ""dax"" leads to a single green.
   - Following ""wif,"" ""walm"" leads to three reds.

2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" leads to a single yellow.
   - Following ""wif,"" ""walm"" also leads to three reds.

3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
   - ""lug"" after ""walm"" leads to a single blue.
   - The pattern for ""walm"" following ""wif"" remains consistent.

4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
   - The order of the words influence the colors associated with following words; ""dax"" after ""walm"" results in green and ""zup"" in yellow.

5. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" at the end repeats the color that appeared just before it thrice.

Observing these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" occurs after a color word, and the output is three times of the color code associated with the word preceding ""walm"". When ""walm"" is at the end, it repeats the preceding color thrice. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""walm"" following any other word causes the output to be the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.

Based on this rule, ""walm"" appears to mean something akin to ""repeat the previous color three times.""

walm -> Repeat the previous color three times.",-0.1163679749065591,100,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the previous color that has been outputted, with the number of repetitions based on the number of times the term ""walm"" appears. Each different input word seems to correspond to a particular color as follows: ""dax"" translates to green, ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""wif"" translates to red. When ""lug"" is present, the color blue is outputted. 

Here's the breakdown of the rule based on the input/output patterns:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

When the word ""walm"" is present, it signifies that the last color mentioned should be repeated. If ""walm"" is mentioned once, the last mentioned color is repeated three times. Each subsequent instance of ""walm"" seems to add two more repetitions of the last color.

Thus, the underlying pattern for ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to infer the meaning of ""wif"". To do this, we need to first look for a pattern in the examples provided:

1. In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red"". Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", it seems that ""wif"" may mean repeating the color mentioned directly before it.

2. In the second example, ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red"". As ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" acts as a change to ""red"", but without repetition, it's difficult to affirm the initial rule deduced from example 1.

3. In the third example, ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red"".

4. In the fourth example, ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue"".

5. In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"". Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", which hasn't appeared on its own, making it difficult to determine what ""walm"" means. But with ""wif"" leading, the output is ""red red red,"" suggesting a repetition of the color ""red"" that is associated with ""wif"".

Combining these different uses of ""wif"", we can posit that ""wif"" carries the meaning of ""red"" when it appears on its own. When followed by another word, it seems to dictate that the color corresponding to ""wif"" (""red"") should be repeated as many times as the instances following ""wif"".

So, the rule could be inferred as:

- When ""wif"" is followed by any other word except ""lug"", the output consists of three ""red"". This can be seen in the example ""wif walm"" which yields ""red red red"".
- When ""wif"" appears in a sequence with ""lug"" right after it, the output is ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"". This conforms to the pattern seen in both ""wif lug"" and ""dax lug wif"".
- However, ""wif"" does not consistently modify the output of words that follow it; its presence does not change the sequence of colors that represent other words (except for the case of ""walm"" after ""wif"").

With these observations, the following rule can be established:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"".

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the relationship between the input and output in each example.

For the first example:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

In this case, ""lug"" triggers the output ""blue"" and ""walm"" also produces ""blue,"" shown by the repetition (three times).

For the second example:
Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

We see that ""dax"" seems to trigger the output ""green"" and ""wif"" produces ""red."" The word ""bluf"" seems related to ""bluff,"" but there are no clear indications of its meaning from this example alone. However, ""walm"" again results in the same color as the first word's output, shown by the three ""green"" in this case. 

For the third example:
Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

The appearance of ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" In this case, we have ""walm"" after ""wif,"" but ""walm"" seems to repeat the output linked to ""wif,"" as indicated by three additional ""red.""

For the fourth example:
Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Here ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" which is unique to this example, but ""walm"" follows suit with a triple ""yellow."" ""Wif"" continues to consistently trigger ""red.""

For the fifth example:
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

In this case, there's no new word, only ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" with ""wif"" triggering ""red"" and ""walm"" repeating it three times, as seen in prior examples.

Analyzing the outputs, it seems that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the preceding non-walm word and repeats it thrice. If ""walm"" is the second word in the input, it repeats the color of the first word. If it occurs later, it repeats the color of the word just before it. There are no examples to deduce the behavior of ""walm"" if it's the first word in the input or if it follows another ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color associated with the preceding non-walm word three times.""

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

1. dax wif bluf -> green red red
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Looking at these inputs and outputs, we notice that:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- However, when ""dax"" appears before ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" (""dax wif bluf""), the output is not a straightforward triple color, but rather ""green red red."" This suggests the word that appears before ""bluf"" determines the color that is repeated twice in the output, and for ""dax"" followed by ""wif,"" ""dax"" does not impact the color associated with ""bluf.""

Given these observations and the consistency of the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated twice in the output sequence.

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule appears to be:
- ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word twice.

4. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

5. Input: zup bluf

Analyzing the outputs in relation to the word preceding 'bluf', we notice:

- When 'dax' is before 'bluf', the color corresponding to 'dax' is followed by 'red'.
- When 'zup' is before 'bluf', the color corresponding to 'zup' is followed by 'yellow'.
- When 'wif' is before 'bluf', the color corresponding to 'wif' is followed by 'red'.
- Regardless of what precedes 'bluf', the color 'red' or 'yellow' always follows the color associated with the word immediately before 'bluf' (except 'lug', which we can assume has its own color output of 'blue').

From this, we can deduce the rule that 'bluf' seems to repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding it with the exception that no matter the initial color, 'bluf' always turns it into either red or yellow. However, the logic for when 'red' is used versus when 'yellow' is used is not clear from the given examples alone.

But as red and yellow only ever follow 'dax' or 'wif' and 'zup' respectively, we can make a tentative rule based on the provided data:

- ""zup bluf"": ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"", resulting in ""yellow yellow"".

- The word ""lug"" produces the color ""blue.""

Now, let's look at the occurrences of ""bluf"" in the inputs and their outputs:

- First example: ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red."" We can see that ""dax"" gives us ""green,"" ""wif"" gives us ""red,"" and ""bluf"" likely gives us another ""red"" since there is no other new word to account for the second ""red"" in the output.
- Second example: ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and since the only other word is ""bluf"" and the output is another ""yellow,"" it indicates that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" in this context.
- The third example reinforces the rule that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" is the only other word and the output is another ""red,"" it again suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" as well.
- The fourth example: ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" resulting in ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"" shows that ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" gives ""green."" We see that ""bluf"" appears twice, preceded once by ""lug"" and once by ""zup,"" and each time it corresponds to the color that the preceding word represents (""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively). This suggests that ""bluf"" acts like a mirror or duplicator for the color of the word immediately before it.

Input: wif zup

From the first example, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

The second example also supports this, as adding another word ""bluf"" associated with a color does not change the output for ""wif"".

In the third example, additional words ""lug walm"" result in multiple ""blue"" in the output, which could indicate either repetition or pluralization in the nonce language.

In the fourth and fifth examples, ""zup"" and ""dax"" relate to distinct colors yellow and green, respectively, which are different from the repetition or pluralization pattern in the third example.

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color word prior to its appearance. Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- Example 2: ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red"", indicating that ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.
- Example 3: ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" makes ""blue"" be repeated.
- Example 4: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"", ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated twice here, note the sequence change.
- Example 5: ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", hence ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated.

Given that the repetitions vary with the presence of ""walm"" and the color word beforehand, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a color word, it repeats that color word in the output three times, resulting in a sequence of three of the same color, if there is no interrupting word. If there is an interrupting word after ""walm"" (like ""lug"" or ""dax""), then ""walm"" might just duplicate the preceding color twice, followed by the new sequence of color words.

- Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence, the output sequence always ends with green.

Based on these observations, it is apparent that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output. In instances where other words precede ""dax,"" these words are translated into their own corresponding colors; meanwhile, ""dax"" remains constant in translating to green. Thus:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze how it affects the output based on the given examples:

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" -> green; ""bluf"" -> green

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" -> blue; ""walm"" is absent in the output which suggests it might be a null operation; ""wif"" -> red; ""bluf"" succeeding ""lug"" -> blue, but ""bluf"" succeeding ""wif"" -> blue again, which violates the previously deduced rule of ""wif"" associating with red. 

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""wif"" -> red; ""bluf"" -> red; ""lug"" -> blue.

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow
- ""wif"" -> red; ""lug"" -> blue; ""bluf"" -> blue; ""zup"" -> yellow.

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green
- ""lug"" -> blue; ""wif"" -> red; ""dax"" -> green; ""bluf"" -> green.

From these examples, we can observe:
- ""dax"" consistently translates to green.
- ""lug"" consistently translates to blue.
- ""wif"" consistently translates to red.
- ""bluf"" has resulted in green twice and blue three times.

Looking at the patterns, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word immediately before it:

- When preceded by ""dax"" (which translates to green), ""bluf"" gives green.
- When preceded by ""wif"" or ""lug"" (translating to red and blue respectively), ""bluf"" results in blue, regardless of the color associated with the preceding word. It's worth noting that ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" three times and follows ""wif"" only once. However, the ""bluf"" after ""wif"" does not result in red, but blue, indicating it might take on a distinct color (blue) regardless of the previous word or is influenced by another not yet identified rule.

Given the ambiguity and the limited dataset, the best conclusion we can draw is:

Rule: Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" results in the same color as the preceding word except when that word translates to red, in which case ""bluf"" becomes blue. 

Hence, if we generalize this observation into a rule:

bluf -> meaning. 
Rule: ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word preceding it, but defaults to blue when preceded by a word that maps to red.",-0.09018709189777382,104,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the outputs in relation to their corresponding inputs. We need to look at what changes when the word ""bluf"" is added to the input sequences and how the outputs are affected accordingly.

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
   - Without ""bluf,"" we do not know the output for ""dax,"" but with ""bluf,"" it seems to double the color associated with the word before it, so ""dax"" corresponds to green.

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - Comparing this to the other inputs where ""lug"" appears, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red. ""Walm"" hasn't appeared with an output elsewhere, but in this instance, it's followed by blue, like ""lug."" The presence of ""bluf"" doubled the blue associated with ""lug"" and added one extra blue at the end.

3. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
   - Here we see that the presence of ""bluf"" appears to double the red associated with ""wif"" before giving blue for ""lug.""

4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup -> Output: red blue blue red yellow
   - Here, ""wif"" normally gives red, ""lug"" gives blue, and ""zup"" seems to give yellow. ""Bluf"" followed ""lug"" and resulted in an extra blue.

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output: blue red blue green green
   - ""Lug"" gives blue, ""wif"" gives red, and ""dax"" gives green. ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" doubling the green.

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" doubles the color output associated with the immediately preceding word. If ""bluf"" appeared at the beginning of a sequence or without context, it may not be possible to predict its output without additional rules or information. Based on the existing information, the rule can be articulated as:

Rule: bluf -> Doubles the color output that is associated with the word immediately before it.",-0.10133488900508333,104,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word has a corresponding color as its meaning.

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is green if the word before ""bluf"" was ""dax"", or otherwise it is the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".

Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. dax bluf -> green green (since dax is green, bluf is green)
2. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue (bluf follows lug, so it's blue; ""walm"" seems not represented in the output)
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue (bluf follows wif, so it's red)
4. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow (bluf follows lug, so it's blue)
5. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green (bluf follows dax, so it's green)

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the word immediately preceding it, unless the preceding word is ""dax,"" in which case bluf also means green.",-0.1176738568107143,104,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must first look for patterns in the use of the word across the examples provided:

1. In example 1, ""dax bluf"" maps to ""green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" could mean green in this context, as ""dax"" also produces green. 
2. In example 2, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" consistently maps to blue, but ""bluf"" results in blue, not red like ""walm"" or ""wif."" Hence, ""bluf"" could again mean ""blue,"" as it follows a ""lug"" which is also blue.
3. In example 3, ""wif bluf lug"" maps to ""red red blue."" ""Lug"" as seen before is blue, but ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both produce red in this context.
4. In example 4, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" corresponds to ""red blue blue red yellow."" ""Wif"" results in red on both occasions, ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""bluf"" results in blue, following a ""lug"" which is also blue.
5. In example 5, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" converts to ""blue red blue green green."" ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" again produces green following ""dax.""

From analyzing the examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" can take on the color of the preceding word, or it repeats the color output that immediately precedes it. Given that the examples suggest that ""bluf"" does not have an inherent color but rather mimics the color of the word just before it, we can form the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.",-0.13484289368640476,104,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we will look at the output colors corresponding to each sequence that includes the word ""bluf."" By comparing which words produce which colors, we should be able to determine what ""bluf"" translates to.

Here's the analysis:

- In the first and fifth examples, ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both produce the output ""green."" Therefore, it is possible that ""bluf"" means ""green.""

- In the second example, the word ""lug"" appears multiple times and corresponds to the color ""blue"" multiple times, but we also have ""lug bluf"" resulting in ""blue blue."" This seems to reinforce that ""bluf"" could mean ""green"" since the sequence ""lug bluf"" does not result in a color change that's different from ""lug"" or ""dax.""

- In the third and fourth examples, it's a bit more complex because ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" and ""bluf"" produce the same color. However, since we have ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" resulting in ""red blue blue red yellow,"" and we already established ""lug"" as ""blue,"" it's unlikely that ""bluf"" means ""blue."" As it comes after ""lug"" in this sequence, it could still be ""green,"" aligning with the output of ""wif lug bluf.""

Therefore, the consistent rule that can be extracted from these examples is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green."" The presence of ""bluf"" does not seem to be context-dependent, as it yields the same color across different sequences.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the input and output provided in each example. We'll look for patterns that can establish the rules governing this word.

Example Analysis:

1) Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
2) Input: wif dax zup -> Output: red green yellow
3) Input: wif -> Output: red
4) Input: wif walm zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
5) Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Based on these examples, we can induce the following patterns:

- Every time the word ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- The presence of ""wif"" seems to induce a repeated color output for the following words.
  - For example, in example 4, ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""walm"" which correlates to three instances of ""red,"" and then ""zup"" correlates to three instances of ""yellow.""
  - In example 5, ""wif"" comes after ""lug"" and ""walm,"" but the output corresponding to ""wif"" is ""red,"" then the next word ""lug"" is repeated twice as ""blue.""
- The output patterns suggest that ""wif"" serves as a trigger for repetition in the sequence that follows it, but does not by itself determine the number of repetitions, only that there will be repetition.

Therefore, we can deduce the following:

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" triggers a color repeats in the output, with the number of repetitions and the color itself determined by the subsequent words.

Rule: When ""wif"" appears in the input, the next word's corresponding color output is repeated until a new word appears. ""wif"" itself corresponds to ""red."" If ""wif"" is the only word in the input, the output is a single instance of ""red.""",-0.15191120764617289,105,wif

"The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the output ""red."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence, the output ""red"" follows the term ""wif.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word in the ""Input"" corresponds to a color in the ""Output"". To determine the meaning of ""zup"", we should look for a consistent pattern across all provided examples.

Analyzing the examples:

- ""dax zup bluf"" maps to ""green yellow yellow""
- ""dax zup"" maps to ""green yellow""
- ""zup wif"" maps to ""yellow red""
- ""zup wif zup dax"" maps to ""yellow red yellow green""
- ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow red green red red""

From these examples, ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" and ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red."" ""Bluf"" maps to red when following ""wif"" and yellow otherwise. We can infer that ""bluf"" switches meaning based on the preceding word. Meanwhile, ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.11938483778207795,105,zup
"Based on the given input-output pairs, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by looking for patterns in the input that correlate with the output colors. Let's analyze the examples one by one, focusing on the outputs associated with ""zup"":

- When ""dax zup"" appears, the output is ""green yellow"".
- When ""zup wif"" appears, the output is ""yellow red"".
- When ""zup wif zup dax"" appears, the output is ""yellow red yellow green"".
- When ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow red green red red"".

From the first and second examples, we can see that ""zup"" directly corresponds to ""yellow"" because when ""zup"" is present without another ""zup"" following it immediately, the color ""yellow"" is directly output. Furthermore, the presence of ""zup"" doesn't seem to affect the color outputs for other words—those stay consistent, such as ""dax"" always correlating to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

So, our conclusion is that the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is that it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.33824257725090884,105,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look at the common color associated with its appearances:

- In the third example, ""zup"" also corresponds with ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" which corresponds with ""red.""
- In the fourth example, the pattern remains consistent, with ""zup"" correlating with ""yellow"" and ""wif"" with ""red,"" while ""dax"" is consistently ""green.""
- The fifth example follows the same pattern where ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" The new word ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" (the same output twice for two occurrences).

Thus, the meaning of ""zup"" remains consistent across all examples, always translating to ""yellow.""

- ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red"" when it's preceded by ""wif"" and to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""

The word ""zup"" seems always to correspond to the output ""yellow."" It does not appear to change meaning regardless of its position in the input (beginning, middle, or end). The presence of other words does not alter the color that corresponds to ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be:

"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the provided examples regarding the position of ""bluf"" and the resulting colors:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
5. dax bluf -> green green

Observations:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it results in a repetition of ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it results in a repetition of ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it results in a repetition of ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, the color before ""bluf"" is repeated.
- When ""bluf"" is not the last word in the sequence, we do not have an example of the pattern it creates with the following words, except for when ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" which gives ""red red green.""

From these observations, one potential rule regarding ""bluf"" could be:

Rule:
- ""Bluf"" causes the next word to be translated into its respective color twice if ""bluf"" comes before it, except for when ""bluf"" is the last word, in which case the color for the word just before ""bluf"" is repeated twice.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> When preceding a word, it causes the color corresponding to that word to be repeated twice in the output. When it is the last word in a sequence, it causes the color corresponding to the word just before it to be repeated twice.",-0.09952607535389608,105,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

Input: zup bluf wif walm | Output: yellow yellow red red red
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf | Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
Input: dax bluf | Output: green green

From the given examples, every time ""bluf"" appears, it is paired with a color that appears twice in the output sequence. This occurs irrespective of the position of ""bluf"" in the input:

- ""zup bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow""
- ""lug bluf"" corresponds with ""blue blue""
- ""wif bluf"" would correspond with ""red red"" (deduced from ""wif bluf dax"")
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds with ""green green""

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" doubles the color output that corresponds to the word following or preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next or previous word's corresponding color to be outputted twice.",-0.1280813886317663,105,bluf
"From the examples given, we can infer that ""bluf"" is associated with the output of the color repeated twice. However, the rules for determining the specific color are not evident from the word ""bluf"" alone. Instead, it seems that the specific color is determined by the word that precedes ""bluf""

Here's the breakdown:
- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" might lead to the color ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" might lead to the color ""blue.""
- In the third and fifth examples, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" might lead to the color ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" is followed by ""red red green,"" which is mixed with the result ""red red"" from ""wif"" and ""green green"" from ""dax,"" with ""bluf"" coming in between them.

It’s not entirely clear if ""bluf"" on its own corresponds to a specific color or if it simply doubles the color associated with the preceding word, but from the examples, it's safe to generalize that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in each input-output pair:

1. When ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" is given, the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" is producing three instances of ""blue.""

2. For the input ""wif lug dax walm,"" the output is ""red blue green green green."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""walm,"" there are three greens.

3. The input ""dax walm"" results in the output ""green green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" once again has three greens following it.

4. In the case of ""wif walm lug bluf,"" the output is ""red red red blue blue."" We see ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" has three reds before we return to colors associated with their corresponding words.

5. For ""lug walm dax,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" again has three blues.

Now, looking at these patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it three times in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that whatever color precedes it, it will produce that color three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.07948404586843373,105,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" as follows:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", the word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""wif"" and the output sequence associated with that part is ""blue blue blue"". Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" we can infer ""walm"" relates to repeating the color before it (in this case, blue) three times.

2. In the second example, ""wif lug dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" with ""green"" being the color associated with ""dax"" and the sequence ends with three greens, suggesting that ""walm"" might mean to repeat the preceding color three times again.

3. In the third example, ""dax walm"", ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is three greens. This supports the idea that ""walm"" means to repeat the preceding color three times.

4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and results in repeating ""red"" three times before moving on to the next colors.

5. ""lug walm dax"" has an output of ""blue blue blue green"". In this instance, ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" follows ""lug"", again indicating that ""walm"" means to repeat the preceding color three times.

From these examples, it appears the rule is that ""walm"" causes the color word directly before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times in the output sequence.",-0.3118485148027711,105,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, where the input includes the word ""walm"" and the output provides a corresponding sequence of colors, here is the pattern I deduce:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows another word (lug, wif, dax), the output color is the same as the color that follows the preceding word, repeated three times.
  - For ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". Since ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
  - For ""wif lug dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds with ""green"" in the output, resulting in ""green green green"".
  - Similarly, for ""dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which outputs ""green"", thus we get ""green green green"".
  - In ""wif walm lug bluf"", ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds with ""red"", leading to ""red red red"".
  - And lastly, in ""lug walm dax"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), so we get ""blue blue blue"".

It's worth noting that ""bluf"" is always followed by ""red"" in the output, but it also leads to the word ""blue"" preceding it in the output. This may imply that ""bluf"" includes a rule that affects both the previous and the subsequent colors, but the examples given do not provide enough consistent context for the previous word's influence since ""bluf"" appears only as the first or the last word, but never in the middle of a sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we must identify the patterns that correlate with the use of ""walm"" in the input and the transformation seen in the output. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   
In this example, notice that ""lug"" leads to three blues in the output, followed by ""walm"" which seems to switch the output to yellow, repeated thrice.

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
Here, ""dax"" leads to three greens, and ""wif"" after ""walm"" leads to red, followed by ""lug"" which produces blue and then ""dax"" returning to green. Note that ""walm"" does not have a color directly associated with it but seems to cause a change in the subsequent color sequence.

3. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   
""dax"" again correlates with green, and after ""walm"" the color changes to blue for ""lug.""

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   
Here, ""wif"" corresponds with red, ""zup"" with yellow, ""lug"" with blue, and ""dax"" with green. After the last ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the yellow.

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   
Once more, ""dax"" correlates with green, and after ""walm,"" the color changes to red for ""wif.""

Considering these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that whatever word follows ""walm"" will have its corresponding color triplet in the output. If there is no word following ""walm,"" no extra triplet is produced as seen in the third example.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next word's associated color to be outputted three times. If no word follows, no triplet is outputted.",-0.06448286150733674,106,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

- Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output ""blue blue blue"" appears.
- Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output ""green green green"" appears.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

This suggests that ""walm"" causes a repetition of three of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. Let's check if this holds for all examples:

1. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
2. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
3. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
4. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
5. dax walm wif -> green green green red

It seems consistent. The word before ""walm"" defines which color will be repeated three times after ""walm."" Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes a triplet repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> causes threefold repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.",-0.089448842129949,106,walm
"To understand the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the inputs and outputs. Observe how the outputs change with and without the presence of ""walm"" and the positions of other words around ""walm.""

From the given examples, it seems that each non-walm word in the input maps to a specific color:

- ""lug"" consistently maps to blue in the output.
- ""dax"" consistently maps to green in the output.
- ""wif"" consistently maps to red in the output.
- ""zup"" consistently maps to yellow in the output.

Next, when ""walm"" is in the input, it appears to elongate the sequence of colors that map to the word immediately before it:

1. ""lug walm zup walm""
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""lug"" leads to blue, but when followed by ""walm,"" it triples the blue. The same pattern exists for ""zup,"" leading to three yellows when followed by ""walm.""

2. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm""
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" triples the green color output before moving on to ""wif"" and ""lug."" When ""dax"" and ""walm"" are paired again, the green triples again.

3. ""dax walm lug""
   Output: green green green blue
   Again, ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" triples the green output.

4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm""
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Every word outputs its color once except for ""zup,"" which is followed by ""walm"" and thus its corresponding color yellow is outputted three times.

5. ""dax walm wif""
   Output: green green green red
   Here ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" causing the green to triple.

By examining these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word just before it to repeat three times. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it to appear three times consecutively in the output.",-0.10798993790243878,106,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns in the examples provided.

In the first example, ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""lug"" seems to result in triple blue, and ""zup"" leads to triple yellow, while ""walm"" is followed by the word ""yellow."" It could appear that there is a pattern where the word ""walm"" repeats the last color produced, but we need to see if this holds true in other examples.

In the second example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green."" Again, it seems that ""dax"" results in triple green, ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Following ""dax"" is the occurrence of ""walm,"" and the next word is ""green,"" which supports the pattern seen in the first example.

In the third example, ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue."" Here ""dax"" again results in triple green, and ""lug"" results in blue. The occurrence of ""walm"" right after ""dax"" results once again in ""green."" This supports our observation that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

In the fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and yellow is repeated. This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes the repeat of the last color but doesn't seem to demand three repetitions.

The pattern becomes clear: ""walm"" seems to repeat the color word associated with the preceding word but not necessarily the same number of times as that color has been repeated already.

So the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word associated with the preceding word once.

Therefore, if the preceding color-word is ""blue,"" it would add ""blue"" once. If it was ""green,"" then ""green,"" and so on for other colors.",-0.21941483178183674,106,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs that correlate specifically with the instances where ""walm"" appears.

Observing the examples:

- When ""lug walm"" appears together, the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""dax walm"" appears together, the output is ""green green green"".
- When ""zup walm"" is together, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
  
From these three points, we can infer that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word just before it, thrice in the output.

To ensure this is consistent, we should check examples without ""walm"" to see the color associated with ""lug"", ""dax"", and ""zup"":

- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- In all examples where ""dax"" appears without ""walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it appears without ""walm"".

With this information, we can confirm that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word three times in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output.",-0.9022953237418365,106,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce the following relationships:

- In the third example, when ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output starts with ""blue"" and is followed by ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" appears twice and each time it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm."" We need to look for patterns in the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

Let's consider each example and note the pattern of colors corresponding to each word:

1. Input: lug walm 
   Output: blue blue blue

2. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

5. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

Now let's analyze:

- From Example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue.""
- From Example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow.""
- From Example 3, ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red.""
- From Example 4, ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspond to single instances of their respective colors, ""red"" and ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- From Example 5, ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green,"" and ""wif"" to a single ""red.""

After noting the patterns for words that occur singly (lug, dax, zup, wif), we can see that ""walm"" affects the number of times the color corresponding to the directly preceding word is repeated in the output.

Specifically, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that appears right before it to repeat three times. Here's how it maps out:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and in the output, we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times subsequently in the output.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times subsequently.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" leading to ""yellow"" being repeated three times, and when it follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" leading to ""green"" repeated three times, and when it follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

So, in rule format:

walm -> Repeat the preceding word's color three times.",-0.07712508638258242,107,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each input and its corresponding output, analyzing the transformation rules exemplified by known terms and then applying them to the unknown term.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since we have two ""lug"" in the input and two ""blue"" in the output, it suggests that the word ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" We have two occurrences of ""dax"" which translates to two ""green"" and one ""zup"" that translates to one ""yellow."" After these known terms are accounted for, one ""walm"" adds two extra ""green"" in the output.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
Rule: Here ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" as before. The ""walm"" in this sequence adds two additional ""red"" before a ""blue.""

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
Rule: The words ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" maintain their corresponding outputs of ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The ""walm"" in the sequence results in two additional ""yellow"" followed by repeating the previous color (in this case, ""red""), then ""blue.""

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The first instance of ""walm"" adds two more ""green"" and the second instance of ""walm"" adds two more ""red.""

From the given input-output pairs, we can induce the following rule: the term ""walm"" takes the color of the previous word and adds two more instances of that color to the sequence.

Therefore, walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color two more times.",-0.09263705310561542,107,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's isolate the patterns in each of the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug walm → Output: blue blue blue
2. Input: dax zup dax walm → Output: green yellow green green green
3. Input: zup wif walm lug → Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug → Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
5. Input: dax walm wif walm → Output: green green green red red red

Analyzing the structure, we notice that:

- ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to three ""blue.""
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to three ""green.""
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to three ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to three ""red.""

The consistency here is that the word ""walm"" causes the output of the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times. ""Walm"" itself seems to trigger a repetition effect. It does not produce a color on its own, but rather, it repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.11218416906991209,107,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the associated outputs to see if there's a consistent pattern.

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
- ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
- ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red""

From these examples, ""walm"" appears to extend the color output of the word before it, repeating it two additional times. Essentially, ""walm"" creates a triplet of whatever color the preceding word generated. For example:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue"" becomes ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax wif walm"" in ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green"" from ""dax"" is followed by ""green green"" after ""walm"", then ""wif"" produces ""red"" which is followed by ""red red"" after the second ""walm"".

4. Every time ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" follows.

Looking at the repetition of colors in the output, we notice that ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color word that corresponds to the previously mentioned word. Specifically, it causes the color that was generated by the previous word to be repeated two more times, adding up to three instances of the same color in a row.

Let's apply this to each input containing ""walm"":
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and then ""walm"" leads to two more ""blue"".
- In ""dax zup dax walm"", ""dax"" gives us ""green"", followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", then another ""dax"" with ""green"", and finally ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated two more times.
- In ""zup wif walm lug"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat twice, and ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat twice, ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- In ""dax walm wif walm"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat twice, ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat twice.

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs to spot a pattern related to the word's position and the colors associated with it.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - Here, both instances of ""dax"" are followed by ""green"".
   
2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" once again.
   
3. Input: dax lug dax lug wif
   Output: green blue green blue red
   - Once more, every ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".

4. Input: wif dax lug
   Output: red green blue
   - ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" and is followed by ""green"".

5. Input: dax lug dax wif dax
   Output: green blue green red green
   - Each ""dax"" is associated with a ""green"".

By analyzing the pattern, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" appears, it is followed by the color ""green"" in the output. It seems that ""dax"" is directly associated with the color ""green"".

Rule:
dax -> green",-0.06129288026412245,108,dax
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by examining the patterns and where the word ""green"" appears in the output.

Observing the outputs:
1. ""green"" appears every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input.
2. Other words correlate with different colors – ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" with ""green."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but it only appears in the second input, so we'll focus on the first three.

In each case, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the surrounding words, the output color ""green"" is consistent with its appearance. Hence, we can establish a direct correlation between ""dax"" and the output ""green.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green.""

Thus,

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's consider each output and try to identify a pattern based on the presence of the word ""dax"" in the input.

- Whenever an input sequence starts with ""dax,"" the first color in the output sequence is green.
- The color following the word ""dax"" is not consistent but the word ""dax"" itself always corresponds to green.
- ""dax"" does not seem to change the color output of the words following it since ""lug"" after ""dax"" can be blue, just like ""lug"" without a preceding ""dax.""

Given this, it appears that the word ""dax"" itself is associated with the color green, while the other colors correspond to the other words regardless of the presence of ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green.",-1.4061358315534698,108,dax

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for a consistent pattern between the input containing ""bluf"" and the corresponding output.

From the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow green yellow green red red
3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
5. Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow

Looking at the patterns, every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output includes a repeated color. In examples 1, 2, and 3, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and the output is ""red red."" In example 4, ""bluf"" stands alone and the output is ""green,"" a repetition of the color that preceded it (green from the translation of ""dax""). In example 5, ""bluf"" appears before ""zup"" but after ""wif,"" and the result starts with the repetition of ""wif"" (red red) followed by the color for ""zup"" (yellow).

From these observations, we can infer a rule with two parts. Firstly, ""bluf"" seems to cause the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output. Secondly, if ""bluf"" is the last word (and does not stand alone or is not preceded by another color word) following ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""

Bluf -> Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is at the end, the output is ""red red.""

In all the cases presented, every time the word ""bluf"" is used in the input, it consistently corresponds to the output ""red red."" There is no deviation from this pattern, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input phrase or the other words present.

"Based on the provided examples, we can determine that walm corresponds to a series of repeated color words that follow it, specifically the color that would ordinarily follow the nonce word before walm in the sequence. To solidify the rule, let's examine each example:

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
Analysis: The walm here follows wif, which corresponds to red, resulting in a repetition of red three times after wif.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: Here walm follows zup, which corresponds to yellow, resulting in yellow being repeated three times.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Analysis: Again, walm follows wif, which has been established to correspond to red, and thus it repeats the word red three times after this occurrence of wif.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
Analysis: walm first follows dax, which corresponds to green, producing three greens. Later, walm is preceded by lug, which corresponds to blue, resulting in three blues.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
Analysis: walm follows wif, thus it gives red three times as seen before.

Based on the patterns observed, the general rule seems to be that walm causes the color word of the immediate previous nonce word to be repeated three times.

- The second example shows ""zup walm"", where ""zup"" represents yellow, and ""walm"" repeats it three times as ""yellow yellow yellow"".

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be translated into a series of the word ""red"" repeated three times.

- In the first example, ""walm"" occurs after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" occurs after ""zup,"" and the output is still ""red red red.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and it's the same: ""red red red.""
- The fourth example shows ""walm"" occurring twice, and both times it translates to ""red red red.""
- The fifth example also supports this, with ""walm"" leading to ""red red red.""

None of the other words before ""walm"" consistently change this pattern. Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" has a standalone meaning that doesn't depend on the preceding word.

"Based on the given examples, each instance of a nonce word corresponds to a specific color. To determine what ""wif"" means, let's examine its occurrences and the output colors:

1. In example 1, ""dax wif lug"" maps to ""green red blue."" ""Dax"" consistently maps to green, and ""lug"" consistently maps to blue across all examples. Therefore, ""wif"" in this context must map to red.

2. In example 2, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" maps to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" As before, ""lug"" consistently maps to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and since ""wif"" precedes a red color each time it appears, it further supports that ""wif"" maps to red.

3. In example 3, ""wif zup dax bluf"" maps to ""red yellow green green."" Here, ""zup"" maps to yellow and ""dax"" to green. Since ""wif"" is followed by red, it is consistent with previous examples.

4. Example 4 showcases ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" mapping to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" Here again, when ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output color is red.

5. Finally, example 5, ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" is mapped to ""blue green green red green."" By this pattern, ""wif"" again leads to red.

Rule: Each nonce word in the input seems to be a place-holder for colors; ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red regardless of its position in the sentence.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red",-0.06379559630470477,109,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the first example:

Input: dax wif lug

""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Following this pattern, ""wif"" must correspond to ""red.""

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" consistently. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" There is no occurrence of ""dax,"" so the correspondence there isn't included.

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

As before, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green"" as well, though it is not immediately clear why.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Consistently, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green

Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on all the examples provided, the rule seems clear:

Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.",-0.06841022207808573,109,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" I'll look at the instances where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output in each example.

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue."" However, we see in other examples ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""wif"" here is likely ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm zup"" twice, resulting in ""red red red"" and ""red red red"" respectively before and after the ""lug"" (""blue""). The sequence with ""walm zup lug"" results in ""red yellow blue,"" with ""lug"" consistently mapping to ""blue"" across the examples, suggesting ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. The third example has ""wif"" coming before ""zup"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively. ""Wif"" again aligns with ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is among other words and corresponds to ""red"" in the output sequence. ""zup"" is always ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is always ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is always ""green,"" reinforcing that ""wif"" aligns with ""red.""

5. Similarly, in the last example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output sequence includes ""red green"" in this part of the sequence.

1. In ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" the word 'bluf' is followed by ""green red green yellow yellow."" The green and yellow colors are repeating from 'dax' and 'zup', which appeared earlier in the input.

2. In ""wif lug bluf,"" the word 'bluf' is followed by ""red blue blue."" We can see that 'red' corresponds to 'wif' and 'blue' corresponds to 'lug'. The word 'bluf' is directly followed by the colors that represent the last two words preceding it.

3. In ""zup bluf,"" the word 'bluf' is followed by ""yellow yellow,"" and 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow.

4. In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" the word 'bluf' is followed by ""blue blue,"" with 'lug' corresponding to the color blue right before 'bluf'.

5. In ""lug bluf,"" like before, 'bluf' is followed by ""blue blue,"" with 'lug' corresponding to the color blue before 'bluf'.

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""zup"" is yellow. Thus, ""bluf"" also yields yellow.
- The second example shows ""lug"" before ""bluf,"" and since ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" is also blue.
- The third example is consistent with the first, with ""zup"" before ""bluf"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" repeating the result of blue for ""bluf.""
- The fifth example reinforces the rule, as ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is blue for both.

   Here again, ""walm"" causes the output associated with ""wif"" to be ""red"" repeated three times, then ""lug"" adds a ""blue"" at the end.

The examples seem too consistent to determine if ""walm"" specifies the number of repetitions and the color or simply the number of repetitions. However, we can deduce that ""walm"" is associated with repetition. The number of repetitions is consistently three, so it could be part of the rule.

Since we do not have deviations from the pattern, let's assume the simplest consistent rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the word prior to it (""wif"" which equals ""red"" in these examples) to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is preceded by a different word in additional examples, and that word is repeated three times, it would confirm the rule includes the number of repetitions. If ""walm"" always causes ""red"" to be repeated regardless of the preceding word, then the word repetition is specifically linked to ""red"". Without varying examples, we can primarily deduce that ""walm"" is linked to the triplication of an output.",-0.29470085872786655,109,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we see that the output associated with the word ""walm"" is a repetition of a color word. Moreover, it appears that the number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the order of ""lug"" and ""wif"" which precede ""walm"":

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" (three repetitions of blue).
- ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red"" (three repetitions of red).
- ""zup wif walm lug"" leads to ""yellow red red red blue"" (incorporating the colors corresponding to ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" in sequence).

Note that ""zup wif walm lug"" yields the same output whether ""lug"" is at the end or not. So we will disregard the position of ""lug"" and just focus on its presence. The rule does not seem to be affected by the repetition of inputs.

The word ""lug"" on its own corresponds to a single instance of the color blue, and the context where ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" leads to the color blue being repeated three times. ""wif"" similarly corresponds to a single instance of the color red, and when it precedes ""walm,"" red is repeated three times.

Considering this pattern, ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color word preceding it three times. However, since there's no mention of what ""zup"" might mean, I'm assuming it is not relevant for the induction of the rule concerning ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word preceding ""walm"" three times.",-0.30993688411720005,109,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color that comes before it. For example, when ""lug"" (which corresponds to the color blue) precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times. Similarly, when ""wif"" (which corresponds to the color red) precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times. Therefore, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it.

- The presence of the word ""dax"" always results in the output containing ""green"".
- The other words seem to correspond with different colors consistently. For instance, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" to ""red red red"".

Thus, it is reasonable to assume the rule here is that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color or sequence of colors as an output. So in this context:

- When the input is solely ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- Whenever ""dax"" appears in any position with other words, the output still includes ""green,"" consistently immediately after the position ""dax"" is in. This suggests ""dax"" correlates directly to ""green.""

Given that the output color ""green"" always appears and corresponds to the presence and position of ""dax"" in the input, regardless of what other words are present or their order, we can formulate the following rule:

dax -> green

This is further supported by the second example ""lug dax walm wif"", which results in ""blue green green green red"". Again, ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color of ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Following this pattern:

"Based on the given examples, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's examine the outputs corresponding to each input where ""bluf"" is present:

1. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug | Output: green yellow red red blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf | Output: red green yellow red green green
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf | Output: blue red blue green green
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup | Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the outputs ""yellow"" and ""blue.""

Considering the above instances, ""bluf"" does not always correspond to the same color output. It seems likely that ""bluf"" changes its corresponding output color based on some aspect of its context within the input sequence.

To find a pattern, let's consider positions where ""bluf"" appears:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which has the output ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after two instances of ""dax"" with outputs ""green."" In this case, ""bluf"" also results in ""green.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" producing ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also produces ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" share the output ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice: once after ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), leading ""bluf"" to correspond to ""yellow,"" and once after ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), leading ""bluf"" to correspond to ""blue.""

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color output of the word immediately before it in the sequence.",-0.07933659879344859,112,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the corresponding outputs for each instance where ""bluf"" appears, while considering the context provided by the other words and their outputs. We'll analyze each line to see if there's a consistent pattern.

1. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug 
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   
   In this instance, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   
   In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   
   In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to both instances of ""blue.""

If we look at the pattern across these examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the color output for ""bluf"" matches the color output for the word that immediately precedes it.
- The color outputs for the other words, such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" seem consistent across all examples (e.g., ""dax"" always leads to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" etc.).

With this analysis, we can conclude the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":
Rule: bluf repeats the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""walm"" seems to add two yellow after the existing sequence before ""lug,"" which gives blue.

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows two pairs of ""dax lug,"" which translates to ""green blue."" After ""walm,"" two additional ""blue"" appear.

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""zup"" gives yellow, and ""walm"" is followed by two yellows and then a blue for ""lug.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" adds another blue, and then ""dax"" translates to green.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- Here, regardless of ""bluf,"" ""walm"" seems to add two more blues after ""lug.""

Overall, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it twice more in the output. So, it could be understood as a command to duplicate the previous color output twice.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.",-0.07335911377288888,112,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is at both the start and end of the sequence. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and immediately following it is ""walm,"" which results in two more ""yellow"" before the final ""blue.""

2. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue green blue blue blue.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after the final ""lug,"" ""walm"" produces two additional ""blue.""

3. ""zup walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" produces two more ""yellow"" before ""lug"" introduces ""blue.""

4. ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" After the initial ""blue,"" ""walm"" leads to two more ""blue"" before ""dax"" changes the color to ""green.""

5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is not in the output colors (""bluf"" does not contribute to the output), ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""lug,"" ""walm"" produces two additional ""blue.""

Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Each time ""walm"" appears, it results in two additional instances of the color that appeared immediately before it.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" etc.
- ""walm"" does not introduce a new color but replicates the color before it.

Therefore, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents the repetition of the color that appears immediately before it in the sequence. ""Walm"" causes the previously mentioned color to appear two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Replicates the preceding color two additional times.",-0.08899664408377779,112,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule about the meaning of ""walm"". Let's break down each example and identify the pattern:

- Input: lug zup walm lug | Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
    - The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""lug"". ""Walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"".

- Input: dax lug dax lug walm | Output: green blue green blue blue blue
    - The word ""walm"" comes after two pairs of the words ""dax"" and ""lug"". ""Walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue"".

- Input: zup walm lug wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
    - The word ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and is followed by ""lug"". ""Walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"".

- Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green
    - The word ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax"". ""Walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue"".

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
    - The word ""walm"" follows a sequence of ""wif zup bluf lug"". ""Walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue"".

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" translates into repeating the color that directly precedes it. However, in the fourth example, ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue blue"" instead of ""blue blue blue"", indicating that perhaps the repetition count might be limited to two or the context includes the word following ""walm"" as well.

Taking these into consideration, the rule could be formulated as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" twice.

However, this rule may not be fully accurate since it doesn't explain why in the fourth example the word ""lug"" before ""walm"" didn't result in three ""blue"" in the output as it does in the first example. We might need further examples to refine this rule.",-0.11840300209577778,112,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with repeated colors in the output. The color that is repeated is the one that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here is the rule induction based on the given examples:

1. In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug"", the word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"". After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated twice, and followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

2. In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"", ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color for ""lug"" is ""blue"". After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice.

3. In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif"", ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and its output color ""yellow"" is repeated twice before moving on to the next color ""blue"" for ""lug"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif"".

4. In the fourth example, ""lug walm dax"", ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and therefore the color ""blue"" is repeated twice before ""green"", which corresponds to ""dax"".

5. In the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"". ""Blue"" which is the output for ""lug"" is then repeated twice.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated twice in the output.

walm -> the preceding word's color is repeated twice in the output.",-0.5222361280992225,112,walm
"By examining the repetition and placement of ""walm"" in the given examples and analyzing the corresponding outputs, a pattern can be deduced. We can focus on the word that precedes ""walm"" and the colors that follow ""walm"" in the output to figure out the rule that applies:

- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue"".

We can notice that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes right before it. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word twice.

Output: green red

Input: wif walm

From these examples, we can observe that every time the word ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is in the corresponding position in the output sequence, regardless of what other words are present or in what order they appear.

Hence, the rule seems to be:
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present, it translates to the color ""red"".",-0.07256764545040541,113,wif
"Analyzing the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif."" Let's examine each example and the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green

If we take ""wif"" as a constant and look at the examples, it seems like the appearance of the word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"" appearing in the output immediately after any mention of ""wif.""

Taking each example into account:

1. After ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
2. ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" again.
3. ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red,"" where ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" once more.
4. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" directly leads to the first ""red.""
5. Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""

The rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can therefore be deduced as follows:

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears, it changes the color of the next word in the sequence to red.",-0.10931705375554052,113,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we will look at each given input and the corresponding output with a focus on identifying any patterns that involve ""wif"":

- In the first input/output pair (""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""), ""wif"" is preceded by ""walm"" (green) and followed by ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in the output ""red"" for ""wif"".
- In the second pair (""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""), ""wif"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and results in ""red"".
- In the third pair (""dax wif"" -> ""green red""), ""wif"" follows ""dax"" (green) and results in ""red"".
- In the fourth pair (""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""), ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" (red), and ""wif"" itself translates to ""red"".
- In the fifth pair (""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""), ""wif"" is situated between two occurrences of ""lug"" (blue), resulting in ""wif"" being ""red"".

From these examples, it appears that the rule for ""wif"" is consistent: no matter what word comes before or after ""wif,"" the output for ""wif"" is always ""red."" The context (neighboring words) does not seem to change the output associated with ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red. Regardless of context, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",-0.12381605950006755,113,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

1. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""
2. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
3. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
4. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
5. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""

Let's analyze the visible patterns:

- The word ""wif"" appears in different positions in the sentences. Whenever it is used, the word following ""wif"" changes the color in the output to red.
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.
- ""wif"" does not correspond to a color when it's by itself; instead, it seems to cause the color of the next word to change to red.
- When ""wif"" precedes a word that has already been given a color (dax -> green, zup -> yellow), that word turns red in the output instead.
- In the case where ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" which we haven't seen by itself, it results in ""red red red,"" which might indicate that when ""wif"" comes before an unknown word, it could be repeating the color conversion effect of ""wif,"" but because we don't know the color of ""walm"" by itself, we can't be certain.

Based on this information, a likely rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" changes the color associated with the following word to red, indicating some form of negation or alteration effect on the subsequent word. If there is no word following ""wif,"" the output for ""wif"" is red by itself, showing that its effect needs a target.

Therefore, the meaning could be formulated as:

wif -> changes the next word's color to red. If there is no next word, output ""red"" for ""wif.""",-0.149323937817973,113,wif
"Based on the examples provided, wif appears to be associated with the color red. However, we can also see that the word that immediately follows wif changes color. For example, when another word follows wif, that word is in the color that represents it (e.g., ""wif zup"" outputs ""red yellow,"" with ""zup"" having its own consistent color yellow). However, when wif is at the end of the sequence or does not have a following word (""zup wif"", ""dax wif""), the output is red for the word wif itself.

Moreover, when ""wif"" precedes a word, that word maintains its colour (see ""wif walm"", ""lug wif lug"") but repeated for the length of the word that follows (three reds for ""walm"", two blues for ""lug""). This continuity must be taken into account.

We can come up with the following rule:

Rule: wif -> changes color of the following word and turns red itself when at the end of an input sequence or not followed by another word. If followed by another word, ""wif"" becomes a repetition of the following word's color.",-1.096679967122973,113,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" acts as an instruction to repeat the color corresponding to the following nonce word one additional time. Here is how ""zup"" relates to the examples:

1. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Without ""zup,"" we'd expect ""walm lug wif bluf"" to translate to ""yellow blue red,"" but each color is mentioned one more time than it would otherwise be, starting from ""walm.""

2. ""zup"" on its own leads to ""yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" itself corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow."" Without ""zup,"" we might expect ""bluf"" to result in just one ""yellow."" However, ""zup"" causes the ""yellow"" to be repeated.

4. ""zup"" again leads to ""yellow,"" consistent with the standalone use of ""zup"" in example 2.

5. ""zup dax lug"" leads to ""yellow green blue."" ""Dax"" and ""lug"" would typically correspond to ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively. However, due to the presence of ""zup,"" the color associated with ""zup"" (""yellow"") is repeated once before continuing with the colors for ""dax"" and ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

- ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"" after two instances of ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" and ""walm"".
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" outputs ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". Here, ""bluf"" repeats the ""red"" of ""wif"" before it, and the sequence continues with another ""dax"" which is ""green"".",-0.15203027513462647,113,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word(s), also bluf designates the end of the sequence because every sequence ends after bluf. Here is the rule induction based on the given inputs and outputs:

- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue""

Now, let's examine the patterns:

1. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". The presence of ""bluf"" after ""wif"" doubles the output associated with ""wif"" which is ""red"".
2. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"". Similarly, ""bluf"" doubles the ""green"" associated with ""dax"".
3. ""zup dax bluf"" gives ""yellow green green"". Here, ""zup"" gives ""yellow"" and ""dax bluf"" doubles the ""green"".
4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" - The sequence ""lug walm"" gives a double ""blue"", ""wif"" gives ""red"", and ""bluf"" doubles the preceding colors, thus ""blue blue blue red red"".
5. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" - Here ""dax"" gives ""green"", ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue"", then another ""dax"" gives another ""green"", ""wif"" results in ""red"", and ""bluf"" after ""wif"" repeats ""red"" resulting in ""red red"", but there is also another ""dax"" at the end which does not follow this pattern. Given that all sequences end with ""bluf"", and no output follows ""bluf"", we can assume the final ""dax"" here is extraneous or not meant to influence the output.

Based on these observations, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: The presence of ""bluf"" in a sequence prompts us to repeat the associated color(s) of the preceding word or words immediately in the output. It signifies the end of the command sequence as there is no output following ""bluf"" and should be ignored if it appears after ""bluf"".

So:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color(s) associated with the previous word(s) in the output sequence and signal the end of the sequence. Repeat each color from the preceding words once and then terminate the sequence.",-0.282778847732747,113,bluf
"Rule: ""Bluf"" appears to be an instruction to duplicate the color associated with the preceding nonce word(s). If more than one different nonce word precedes ""bluf,"" then each of their respective colors is repeated once.

For example:
- wif bluf: wif -> red, so red red
- dax bluf: dax -> green, so green green
- zup dax bluf: zup -> yellow, dax -> green, so yellow green green (with ""green"" repeated from ""dax"")
- lug walm wif bluf: lug -> blue, walm -> blue, wif -> red, so blue blue blue red red (with ""blue"" repeated from ""lug"" and ""walm,"" and ""red"" repeated from ""wif"")
- dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax: the sequence before ""bluf"" contains dax (green), lug (blue), walm (blue), dax (green), and wif (red), so the output is a repetition of these colors, followed by green again for the final occurrence of dax.

So ""bluf"" seems to cause a repetition of the previously mentioned colors.",-0.29524032756337354,113,bluf

"Bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: For each occurrence of the word 'bluf' in the input, the output repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding 'bluf'.

When two words that correspond to a single color ('lug walm') appear together followed by 'bluf', that color is repeated twice (since there are two words). When 'bluf' follows these words, the associated color—blue—is output twice.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that is mentioned just before it. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- ""lug walm"": ""lug"" translates to the color blue, so ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- ""wif walm"": ""wif"" translates to the color red, so ""walm"" leads to ""red red red.""
- ""dax walm wif dax"": ""dax"" translates to the color green, so ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green green green,"" then it continues with the color translation for ""wif"" and ""dax"" once more.
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"": ""dax"" translates to the color green, so ""walm"" implies ""green green green,"" followed by the translation for ""zup.""

- ""dax walm"" in the input ""dax walm wif dax"" produces ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug wif dax walm"" the ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and yields ""green green green"".

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green repeated three times.

"Given the examples provided:

Input: dax walm lug  
Output: green green green blue

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug  
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Input: zup lug  
Output: yellow blue

Input: lug zup  
Output: blue yellow

Input: zup dax lug walm zup  
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Firstly, let's look at examples that feature ""lug"" with another single word:

Input: zup lug  
Output: yellow blue

Input: lug zup  
Output: blue yellow

We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of its position relative to ""lug"", which tells us that ""lug"" does not impact the color associated with ""zup"".

Now let's look at examples where ""lug"" appears with several words:

Input: dax walm lug  
Output: green green green blue

""dax walm"" results in ""green green"", and by adding ""lug"" to the end, we obtain an additional ""blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" in this context since it's the only new element added.

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug  
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"" here, similarly to ""zup"". ""lug"" retains its association with ""blue"" at the end of the sequence, similar to its usage in the ""dax walm lug"" example.

Finally, in:

Input: zup dax lug walm zup  
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at both the beginning and end. ""dax"" and ""walm"" are associated with ""green"", and ""lug"" appears to correspond with ""blue"" again, maintaining its consistency across the previous examples.

From the examples, we can induce that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".",-0.08170030201356578,114,lug
"From the provided examples, we can attempt to discern the underlying rule for the nonce word ""lug.""

1. In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" maps to ""green green green blue,"" whereas ""dax"" and ""walm"" repeatedly map to ""green"" in other examples. So, ""lug"" appears to be the only element that causes a different color, ""blue,"" to appear in the sequence. 

2. In the second example, we see that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" again results in ""blue."" Notably, ""bluf"" also results in ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is the element adjacent to both instances of ""yellow"" that produces ""blue.""

3. The third and fourth examples, ""zup lug"" and ""lug zup,"" both include ""zup"" and ""lug"" side by side and their outputs are ""yellow blue"" and ""blue yellow"" respectively, reinforcing that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Finally, the fifth example lists a sequence with ""lug"" surrounded by ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm,"" all mapping to their respective colors with ""lug"" again corresponding to blue.

Given the information from these examples, the rule appears to be consistent and clear:

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduct that ""wif"" results in the output ""red.""

However, ""dax"" seems contextually dependent, as it results in ""green"" when preceded by ""wif"" and followed by another ""wif,"" but does not receive a color output when it is the first word. This suggests that ""dax"" either requires a preceding word to be assigned a color, or that it changes based on its position in the sequence.

""Zup"" and ""lug"" are single occurrences with consistent outputs: ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" results in ""blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif dax"" in the sequence and its output is ""green,"" which is the same output as ""dax,"" so it may share a conditional rule with ""dax"" or simply coincidentally outputs the same color.

There is not enough data to fully determine any additional rules or meanings for words other than ""wif."" The rule derived from these examples can be stated as follows:

From these observations, the rule is as follows:

Therefore, based on this pattern, we can induce that ""bluf"" typically translates to ""red,"" but it can also take on the color value that precedes it in sequence if that preceding color is linked to certain specific words, such as ""lug"" and ""dax.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to alternating between the colors ""blue"" and ""red"". However, it is important to note that ""bluf"" does not stand for the same color in each occurrence; rather, it alternates between ""blue"" and ""red"" each time it appears within a sequence.

Here's the pattern:

1. wif bluf lug zup -> red blue blue yellow
2. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue red yellow red red
3. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue red green blue
4. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green red yellow blue green
5. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red blue

To illustrate:

- In the first sequence, ""bluf"" is blue, because it's the only occurrence of ""bluf"".
- In the second sequence, the first ""bluf"" is red and the second ""bluf"" is blue.
- In the third sequence, the first ""bluf"" is red, and the second ""bluf"" is blue.
- In the fourth sequence, the pattern repeats with ""bluf"" being red then blue.
- Finally, in the fifth sequence, ""bluf"" stands for blue because it's the only occurrence.

So the rule is: ""bluf"" alternates between red and blue, starting with red if it's the first appearance in a given sequence, then switches to blue for the next appearance, and continues to alternate in any sequence where it appears more than once.

"Analyzing the given examples, we notice that the output color changes depending on certain input words. We will focus on the word ""walm"" to understand its relationship with the other words and the corresponding output colors.

Here is the breakdown of the examples given:

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
2. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
3. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
4. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
5. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green

From the first example, we can see that after the word ""zup,"" the color yellow is produced, and following ""walm,"" yellow repeats until a new word is encountered, changing the color to red.

In the second example, ""walm"" again causes a repetition of the color yellow that was introduced by ""zup"" right before it, continuing until a new word ""dax"" changes the sequence to green.

The third example has ""lug"" producing blue, and ""walm"" again repeats the same color (blue) that preceded it.

In the fourth example, we see that ""lug"" introduces blue and ""walm"" again causes blue to repeat until ""dax"" introduces a new color, which is green.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" introduces green, and ""walm"" results in the repetition of that color (green) until a new word is encountered.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence until a new word is encountered that specifies another color. Here is the rule expressed succinctly:

Rule: walm causes a repetition of the most recently introduced color, until a new word specifies a different color.",-0.0785660656192043,114,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the outputs related to the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" in the input. Here's what is noticed:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color immediately following ""walm"" is repeated until a new color (word) or the end of the sequence appears.
- ""walm"" does not correspond to a fixed color output but rather influences the repetition of the following colors.

Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", which corresponds to yellow. After ""walm"", yellow is repeated.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", which corresponds to yellow, followed by a color change that stops the repetition.

3. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" is followed by no other color, so the color before it (blue for ""lug"") is repeated.

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", and the color blue for ""lug"" is repeated until ""dax"" changes the color to green.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, but it's the first word, so ""dax"" dictates the color to be repeated, which is green.

Rule: Walm -> causes the following color to be repeated until a new color word appears; if no new color word appears, the preceding color word is repeated instead. If ""walm"" is the first word, then its influence carries over to the next word (if applicable), which becomes the repeated color.

"Considering the pattern established by consistent color outputs and the positions of the word ""walm,"" we can try to deduce its meaning or the rule it represents. Let's break down the examples provided:

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
(Zup translates to yellow, and wif translates to red.)

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
(Lug translates to blue, dax to green, wif to red, and bluf also to red.)

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
(Lug translates to blue.)

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
(Lug translates to blue and dax to green.)

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
(Dax translates to green, zup to yellow, and lug to blue.)

Looking at the outputs, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. Whenever ""walm"" appears, it takes on the color value of the previous word:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the yellow color.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and repeats the yellow.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and repeats the blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" again and repeats the blue.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" and it's green, this pattern repeats.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the following:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" ""walm"" is yellow; if ""lug,"" then ""walm"" is blue; if ""dax,"" then ""walm"" is green, etc.",-0.08097907058316131,114,walm
"Based on the examples given, the following observations can be made:

1. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
2. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
3. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" except when preceded by ""walm"" where it translates to ""yellow.""
4. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
5. ""walm"" does not have a consistent color translation.

To understand the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe its effect on the surrounding words:

- In the first example, ""walm"" comes before ""wif,"" and the output sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes before ""dax,"" and the output sequence changes from blue to a series of yellows following ""walm,"" except for ""wif,"" which remains red.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm dax"" provides an output of ""blue blue blue green,"" but when there's no ""walm,"" ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green."" This suggests that ""walm"" has an effect on ""lug"" or ""dax"" or both.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green,"" where again we see the effect of turning ""dax"" into ""green"" multiple times.

From the observations, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it, except when followed by ""wif"" or when ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" which breaks the pattern. However, there's a consistent rule that ""walm"" affects the color translation of the words following it, seemingly repeating the color until a word breaks the pattern.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat in the output until a word that doesn't adhere to the rule follows it (like ""wif"" or ""dax"" after ""walm""). 

Therefore:

"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs and outputs systematically. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green."" 
2. ""dax lug wif lug"" translates to ""green blue red blue."" 
3. ""lug dax wif"" translates to ""blue green red.""
4. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red.""
5. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow.""

From examples 1, 3, and 4, every time ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is in the output immediately following the word that corresponds to ""wif"" in the input.

In example 1, ""wif"" precedes ""dax"", and the corresponding output is ""red green"".

In example 2, ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and the output sequence following ""lug"" is ""red blue"".

In example 3, ""wif"" is at the end and ""red"" is the last word in the output.

In example 4, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output sequence starting from the word corresponding to ""wif"" is ""red red red"".

In example 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup walm dax zup"" and the output sequence starting from the word corresponding to ""wif"" is ""red yellow yellow yellow"".

From the correlations, it appears that ""wif"" is translated as ""red,"" but the presence of ""wif"" in the input may also affect the subsequent words. Specifically, repeating words following ""wif"" are translated to ""red"" until a new, non-repeating word appears (as seen in examples 4 and 5). However, given that ""walm"" and ""zup"" are not given direct translations in other examples, we cannot say for certain that ""wif"" directly causes repeated words to become ""red"".

Another observation is that ""dax"" appears to always translate to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" when they are not adjacent to ""wif"". However, when ""lug"" is used after ""wif,"" it remains ""blue"", suggesting ""wif"" may not alter the translation of ""lug"".

   - zup dax -> yellow green

2. When 'dax' is followed by other words:

Notice how 'dax' always corresponds to the color 'green' in the output, regardless of its position. It translates directly to 'green' when it is the only word before or after another word. Moreover, when there are two other words following 'dax', it seems to affect the first word but not the second (e.g., 'dax zup bluf' yields 'green yellow yellow' and not 'green yellow green').

However, we have a conflicting case with 'dax walm', where 'dax' translates to 'green' three times, which doesn't fit with just the translation of 'dax' to 'green'. This extra repetition could be a rule specific to the word 'walm' or an exception that we cannot explain with the given data.

"Observing the pattern where ""bluf"" appears and the associated output, a rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning is determined by replicating the color of the word that precedes it.

Examples:
- In ""zup bluf lug"", ""zup"" correlates to yellow, and thus ""bluf"" produces another yellow.
- In ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" correlates to red, and thus ""bluf"" produces another red.
- In ""zup wif dax wif bluf"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"" which corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" results in red.
- In ""dax zup bluf"", ""zup"" is before ""bluf"" and correlates to yellow, making ""bluf"" also produce yellow.
- In ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"", we see ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" the first time and ""zup"" the second time. Since ""lug"" correlates to blue and ""zup"" correlates to yellow, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word accordingly.

"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the provided examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm   -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
2. Input: zup wif walm        -> Output: yellow red red red
3. Input: wif walm dax        -> Output: red red red green
4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: lug walm zup        -> Output: blue blue blue yellow

Let's initially assign each non-walm input word a color:

- ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow,
- ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color yellow as well,
- ""wif"" correlates with the color red,
- ""dax"" correlates with the color green, and
- ""lug"" correlates with the color blue.

Now, examining the outputs where ""walm"" is present:

- In Example 1 and 2, the word ""walm"" succeeding ""wif"" relates to a sequence of three reds, suggesting a possible repetition of color associated with ""wif.""
- In Example 3, similar to before, ""walm"" again follows ""wif"" and the red color is repeated three times.
- In Example 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is a repetition of the color yellow, suggesting the rule may involve repeating the color that precedes ""walm.""
- In Example 5, ""walm"" succeeds ""lug,"" and the output is a repetition of the color blue.

Based on the observations, ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the preceding word's corresponding color. The number of repetitions may depend on a fixed pattern or directly on the previous word (though the data given does not specify this definitively).

The rule appears to be:

Rule: Walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Given the examples, it is uncertain if there is a specific number of times repetition occurs inherently with ""walm"" or if it varies based on the context. In the examples, the lowest repetition is three times, so ""walm"" could potentially mean ""repeat the previous color three times,"" but the lack of further data makes this uncertain.",-0.07721141872755813,117,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples provided.

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red""
2. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red""
3. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green""
4. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow""

Looking at the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" while in the second example, ""wif walm"" still results in ""red red red."" Thus, we can surmise that ""walm"" contributes to the output of three reds following any sequence of colours. 

However, inspecting the fourth example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" we observe that ""walm"" outputs three repetitions of the color before it, in this case, ""yellow."" In the last example, ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow,"" with ""walm"" again causing a threefold repetition of the color preceding it, ""blue"" here.

Given this consistency across the examples, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color preceding it to be repeated three times in the output. Note, there is no instance where ""walm"" is the first word, so this rule applies when there is a color word preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the colour word preceding it three times in the output.",-0.09550510531139532,117,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the output patterns relative to the input. We will look for a consistent pattern that matches the use of ""walm.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Here, we see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Following this pattern, ""walm"" should account for two instances of ""red.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- For this example, again ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""walm"" must account for two instances of ""red,"" following the pattern from the previous example.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and in this case, ""walm"" is likely to account for two instances of ""red.""

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since ""zup"" directly follows ""walm"" and produces three additional instances of ""yellow,"" it seems likely that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color of the word that follows it.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" In accordance with the previous pattern, ""walm"" results in more ""blue,"" which means it is likely inducing repetition of the preceding color before moving onto ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color of the following word to repeat.

Moreover, based on the inputs and outputs, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the output word that immediately follows it, rather than having a fixed color output of its own. The number of repetitions is dependent on the occurrences before the following word changes. In these cases, ""walm"" induces a repeated output of color that directly follows it in the input.",-0.11809072218406975,117,walm
"Based upon the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns for the colors associated with the words:

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".
- The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"".
- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"".

Now, let's dissect the inputs and outputs with the nonce word ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the sequence of colors is ""yellow yellow red red red"". Since we know ""zup bluf"" result in ""yellow yellow"" and ""wif"" results in ""red"", the first ""walm"" in this context must result in ""red red"".

2. In the second example, since ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and is directly followed by ""walm"", which leads to ""red red red"", it suggests that ""walm"" may again represent a repetition of the color associated with the word directly before it (in this case, ""red"").

3. In the third example, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"" then ""dax"", resulting in ""red red red green"". This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" implies a repetition of the preceding color.

4. The fourth example is unique in that ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue"" and is followed by ""zup walm"", resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""lug"" breaks the previous pattern but then ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and continues with a sequence of ""yellow"", further suggesting that ""walm"" may represent the repetition of the color of the word before it.

5. In the fifth example, we see ""lug walm zup"" lead to colors ""blue blue blue yellow,"" which fits the pattern we have established for ""lug"" and ""zup"", along with the ""walm"" rule of replicating the preceding color, ""blue"" in this case.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" indicates a continuation or repetition of the color directly before it, for as many counts as the word ""walm"" implies in the context.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",-0.364491630642442,117,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the associated outputs in different contexts:

1. When ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of reds with the number of reds increasing by one each time an instance of ""walm"" is present (3 reds when one ""walm,"" 4 reds when two ""walm"").

2. When any other word precedes ""walm,"" the output color matches the color of that word (e.g., ""zup"" leads to yellow, ""lug"" leads to blue), and the quantity of the output color is the number of times ""zup"" or ""lug"" appears before ""walm"" plus the number of ""walm"" (4 yellows if ""zup"" appears three times before ""walm""; 3 blues if ""lug"" appears twice before ""walm"").

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to multiply the immediately preceding color signal by one more than its previous count. If the immediate preceding word is ""wif,"" the output is always red, with the number of reds increasing based on the appearances of ""walm.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" could be considered as a multiplicator of the preceding color signal, adding one more instance of that color to the sequence, with a special rule for ""wif"" where the color is red and counts from three upwards.

Rule:
- walm following ""wif"" -> start with red then add one more red for each instance of ""walm""
- walm following any other word -> replicate the color of the preceding word, with the number being the total occurrences of the preceding word plus the number of occurrences of ""walm""",-1.1580699946081394,117,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. We see that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in every occurrence within the given examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""lug"" is between ""wif"" words and the output is ""red blue red,"" we can deduce that ""lug"" means ""blue"".
- In the second example, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"" and since ""lug"" is at the beginning and end with ""zup"" in between, this further supports that ""lug"" means ""blue"" (output being ""blue yellow red blue"").
- In the third example, the pattern follows with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" and following that, ""lug"" must translate to ""blue"" (output being ""yellow blue"").
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" follows, which tells us that ""lug"" stands for ""blue"" (output being ""red blue"").
- The fifth example shows ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" with ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" which supports the previous deductions (output being ""green blue green red green"").

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the output color of the word following it to be repeated three times.",-0.09311239903808988,118,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can attempt to determine the rule or meaning for the nonce word ""walm.""

Consider the outputs relative to their inputs:
1. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
4. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

From the above, we see that immediately following ""walm,"" the color that appears in the output is always red, and the same color is repeated a number of times equal to the number of words that came before ""walm"" in the input.

Example analysis:
- In example 1, there are three words before ""walm"" and three reds in the output after yellow.
- In example 2, there are two words before ""walm"" and two additional reds in the output after the first red.
- In example 3, there is one word before ""walm"" and a single red in the output.
- In example 4, there is one word before ""walm"" and a single red in the output.
- In example 5, there is one word before ""walm"" and it is immediately followed by a blue in the input and output which indicates the rule for ""walm"" is in effect post the first color appearance.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to ""red"" repeated as many times as there were words before it in the input sequence.

Walm -> ""red"" repeated according the number of preceding words in input sequence.",-0.1230946378286517,118,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word 'walm' is followed by a repeated color word that corresponds to the color word immediately preceding 'walm.' Here are the examples mapped out:

2. wif (red) walm --> red red red
3. dax (green) wif (red) walm --> green red red red
4. wif (red) walm dax (green) zup (yellow) --> red red red green yellow
5. lug (blue) walm --> blue blue blue

- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" which suggests ""bluf"" represents a repeated ""yellow"" here.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with that preceding word the number of times equivalent to the number of words in sequence before ""walm"". For example:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, and there are two words before ""walm,"" so red is repeated twice.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green, and there is one word before ""walm,"" so green is repeated twice.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" — analogously, here ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif lug walm"" gives ""red blue blue blue"" — ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and since there are three words before ""walm,"" the last color before ""walm"" (blue) is repeated three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"" — ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and there are three words before ""walm,"" so blue is replicated three times.

Rule: The output color for ""walm"" is determined by the color of the word immediately before it. It repeats or continues the color sequence that starts with the previous word. For example, if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red (for wif walm) green (for dax)."" If ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" then ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green (for dax walm)."" The same pattern follows for ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""",-0.4929457839633802,119,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output in a way that is dependent on the preceding word. In each case, when ""walm"" is used, the output consists of the corresponding color to the word that directly precedes ""walm"", and it is repeated multiple times. For instance:

- When ""wif"" comes before ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated.
- When ""dax"" comes before ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated.
- When ""zup"" comes before ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated.
- When ""lug"" comes after another word and before ""walm"", ""blue"" is added to the list, but the first color still appears to stem from the word immediately preceding ""lug"".

Here is the potential association between the words and the colors based on the examples:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue (when following another word)

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word directly preceding it, and it repeats it as many times as the total number of words in the input including ""walm."" This can be formulated as:

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for the total number of words in the input (including ""walm"" itself).

To illustrate, ""wif walm dax"" has three words, so the color associated with ""wif"" (red) is repeated three times, followed by the color associated with ""dax"" (green) for a single count as it directly follows ""walm"".",-0.49607625029859154,119,walm
"From the provided examples, each instance of ""walm"" in the input correlates with a threefold repetition of the color given in the output. It seems that ""walm"" determines the color to be tripled in the output. Looking at the first word of each input before ""walm,"" we can deduce the following associations:

- ""wif"" leads to ""red""
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
- When ""lug"" is added after these words, the color ""blue"" is added an extra time in the output, except in the case where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" immediately. It seems like ""lug"" might not be affecting ""walm"" directly, but rather it is adding ""blue"" to the sequence.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the preceding word in the input sequence. However, if ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""walm"" is not directly associated with ""blue,"" but rather it continues the pattern set by the word preceding ""lug.""

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, the color associated with the immediate preceding word (excluding ""lug"") is repeated three times in the output.

For example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""wif"" has one syllable, the output after ""walm"" is ""red"" repeated once.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"", which corresponds to ""green green yellow"". Since the other words in the sequence produce a single color, it suggests that the presence of ""walm"" changes subsequent colors in the output.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", and ""lug"" precedes it. The output is ""blue blue"", showing the presence of ""walm"" between two ""lug"" causes a repetition of the color ""blue"".

3. In the third example, there's one ""walm"" at the end, which results in two additional ""yellow"" colors in the output.

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and no other word follows. This results in three occurrences of the color ""blue"" in the output, suggesting that ""walm"" might duplicate the color before it when it is the last word.

5. In the fifth example, the single presence of ""walm"" with no following words results in three ""yellow"" outputs, further supporting the duplication theory from the fourth example.

Considering all these observations, we can infer that the word ""walm"" causes the next color word (and possibly previous colors, if it is at the end) to be repeated in the output sequence.

1. In the first example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green."" Since ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" ""walm"" here also means ""green.""

- ""lug wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue red yellow red""

We can deduce that the output sequence consists of color names. Each nonce word (lug, zup, dax, bluf, walm) corresponds to a color. The word ""wif"" appears before a color change and itself consistently corresponds to the color red.

For instance, in the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and occurs twice in succession, but ""wif"" comes before the transition to ""walm,"" which corresponds to yellow. Again, ""wif"" is followed by the color red. In the second example, ""wif"" precedes a change from ""lug"" (blue) to ""zup"" (yellow) and again to red.

4. dax bluf -> green green
5. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue

Let's try to infer a rule based on the positions and corresponding colors:

- ""dax"" is correlated with ""green"" in various positions.
- ""zup"" is correlated with ""yellow"" when it is at the end of the sequence.
- ""wif"" is correlated with ""red"" in various positions.
- ""lug"" is correlated with ""blue"" when it is at the end of the sequence.
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" when next to ""dax,"" and it also correlates with ""red"" when next to ""wif.""

Considering these patterns, we cannot discern a change in the pattern specifically attributable to ""bluf."" Rather, ""bluf"" seems to reflect the color associated with the following word:

- When followed by ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green,"" it also yields ""green.""
- When followed by ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red,"" it yields ""red.""

However, we have no example showing ""bluf"" at the end or beginning or followed by any other word besides ""dax"" and ""wif.""

Given the limited information, the best we can infer about ""bluf"" from these examples is that it mirrors the output color of the word that immediately follows it (or that it perhaps intensifies the color that follows it, given ""dax bluf"" also results in ""green green"").

Rule: bluf -> mirrors the output of the following word.",-0.10489600066060979,122,bluf

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" (dax bluf), the output is ""green green."" 
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" (wif bluf dax), the output is ""red red green.""
- When ""bluf"" is in a sentence followed by ""zup"" (wif dax wif bluf zup wif), the color after ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" regardless of the word before ""bluf"" or the other words in the sequence.
- When ""dax"" is directly before ""bluf"" without any other words following (dax bluf), the output remains ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by a word that has not appeared in the previous examples, ""lug"" in this case (wif bluf dax lug), we get ""red red green blue,"" but since ""dax"" consistently produces ""green,"" we can assume ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

The rule for ""bluf"" seems to be its position and the words around it affect the color output.

Rule: 
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" when preceded by ""dax.""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" when preceded by any word other than ""dax.""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" when followed by ""zup.""

However, this rule only accounts for the given examples, and with the available data, it cannot be determined what ""bluf"" means in the contexts where ""lug"" follows or when other words not in the previous examples precede or follow it. Therefore, ""bluf"" appears to change the color of the word following it depending on the specific context of the words around it in these examples.

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, but not always (since its color changes when it is preceded by ""bluf"").
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Now, looking at the usage of ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it also corresponds to the color green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to the color red.

- In example 2, ""lug wif dax"" stands for blue red green, but when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow yellow yellow for the respective yellow entry.

- In example 3, every occurrence of ""walm"" causes the preceding color to triple in the output.

- The third input ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" becomes ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" which maintains consistency as each ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" each ""wif"" to ""red,"" and presumably ""bluf"" to ""blue"" and ""walm"" to ""red"".
- ""wif bluf"" turns into ""red red,"" once again showing ""wif"" meaning ""red"" and confirming that ""bluf"" also means ""red.""
- Lastly, in ""zup wif lug,"" the output is ""yellow red blue."" This corresponds with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.1067944364557534,123,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the meaning of the word ""wif"". Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

2. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red

In both examples, the word ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output. This is a common pattern, suggesting that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   
- ""lug"" appears three times and translates to ""blue"" each time. 
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" consistent with the appearance of the second ""blue"" in the output.
- ""walm"" has no previous translation, but it can be deduced as ""red"" given the pattern of other colors and their order.
- Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"". 

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

- ""bluf"" was already inferred to be ""blue,"" but appears as ""red"" in this output. However, considering the potential translation of ""wif"" to ""red,"" it can be inferred that ""wif"" may change the meaning of the following word to ""red.""

5. Input: zup wif lug
   Output: yellow red blue

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and given our previous rule induction for ""wif,"" we can confirm once again that it results in ""red"" whenever it is used.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif translates to ""red"" or alters the color translation of the following word to ""red"". However, since there is a lack of contextual patterns showing ""wif"" changing the meaning of the following word in all examples, the rule can be refined.

Refined Rule: wif -> red

Given the consistency across examples, we can conclude that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".",-0.10885189176000001,123,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. This is consistent across all provided examples. Other words such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" correlate with ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:
wif -> red",-1.2611641494315065,123,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to ""red."" Therefore, we can generalize the meaning as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Every instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",-1.7538002384460267,123,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the word 'wif' corresponds to the output 'red'. Every instance where 'wif' appears, the word 'red' follows in the output.

Therefore, the meaning of 'wif' in this context can be equated to the word 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red",-1.7838380749082194,123,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules:

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is always ""yellow yellow yellow.""
    - ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

2. When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
    - ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

3. The word ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" as seen in two separate instances (""lug wif"" -> ""blue red"" and ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").
    - ""wif"" -> ""red""

4. The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" (as derived from ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red"").
    - ""lug"" -> ""blue""

5. When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" and this sequence (""zup dax"") is repeated, each occurrence translates to ""yellow"" followed by ""green.""
    - ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""

By analyzing these examples, we determine that ""zup"" is a function that modifies or determines the color to follow. Specifically, it has the following effects:

- ""zup walm"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may be inherently tied to the ""yellow"" output when paired with ""zup.""
- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" could also correlate with a ""yellow"" result when combined with ""zup,"" but to a lesser extent than ""walm.""
- A standalone ""zup"" has no example, so its independent effect is unspecified.
- The word following ""zup"" seems to dictate the output colors, with ""walm"" and ""bluf"" specifically yielding yellow shades, and ""dax"" introducing green into the sequence.

These observations lead to a general rule for the meaning of ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" signifies a directive that affects the color output, with the subsequent word determining the exact sequence of colors. ""Walm"" and ""bluf"" following ""zup"" produce sequences of yellow, and ""dax"" introduces both yellow and green.",-0.5473032835670888,123,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's examine the patterns in the given input-output examples. Here is what we can infer from the available data:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is always ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When other words follow ""zup walm,"" they are translated individually (e.g., ""lug"" becomes ""blue,"" ""wif"" becomes ""red"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" This implies ""bluf"" is equivalent to one ""yellow"" since ""zup bluf"" results in one less ""yellow"" than ""zup walm.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow green."" This occurs twice in the sequence ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" and is consistent each time, suggesting that ""dax"" following ""zup"" translates to ""green.""

Given the consistent pattern that occurs when ""zup"" is used, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and it seems to repeat the word ""yellow"" for each nonce word that follows it until a different amount of ""yellow"" is broken by another rule. For ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" there is one fewer ""yellow,"" implying that ""bluf"" somehow subtracts one ""yellow."" When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" the pattern changes, and ""green"" is introduced, followed by the standard ""yellow.""

Summarizing the rule in a more general form, we can state:

Rule: ""zup"" produces a series of ""yellow"" outputs equal to the number of nonce words that follow it, with certain words modifying the pattern if they follow ""zup."" Specifically, ""bluf"" reduces the count by one, and ""dax"" changes the output from ""yellow"" to ""green"" while still being followed by ""yellow.""",-0.549146531685443,123,zup
"Rule: Each time the word ""zup"" is used, it invokes a color code sequence that starts with ""yellow"" or continues with the next color in the sequence. The sequence appears to be yellow, green, yellow, and then starting over as needed.
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""walm"" means two instances of the color yellow.
- ""lug"" is related to the color blue.
- ""wif"" is related to the color red.
- ""bluf"" alone causes the output of ""yellow yellow"", suggesting that it could be equivalent to ""walm"" or that in the absence of ""walm,"" ""bluf"" triggers the same output.
- ""dax"" translates to green when it follows ""zup,"" which fits with the sequence theory, suggesting that ""zup"" resets the color sequence with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" follows with the next color in the pattern, which is green.

zup -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""zup"" is a function that outputs ""yellow"" and sets or resets a color sequence. Subsequent words dictate the continuation of the sequence or introduce new color codes, depending on their predefined meaning.",-0.7230444166616457,123,zup
"Rule: ""zup"" dictates the color pattern that follows, assigning a specific color based on the following word. 

Based on the output, the rule appears to work as followed:
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Therefore, when ""zup"" precedes a word, it signals the start of a sequence of colors determined by the words that follow. If ""zup"" is repeated before a word that has already been translated to a color, the same color is repeated in the output. 

Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" serves as a kind of indicator for a color encoding system.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" replicates the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. For each instance of ""bluf"" in the input, the output repeats the color that translates from the preceding word. Here is the inferred rule:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Hence, when ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to that word. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.7125522479668748,123,bluf

- In the presence of another word for which there is a known color correspondence after ""bluf"" (as in ""zup bluf lug""), ""bluf"" duplicates the color corresponding to the word before it (""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" turns into ""yellow"" as well).

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-1.2093117053201252,123,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.,-1.5567255651725,123,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's observe the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

Firstly, note that each input word corresponds to a colored output:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

With this information, let's consider the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug,"" we have the corresponding output ""green green green yellow blue."" It can be noted that ""walm"" here corresponds to a repeated color ""green.""
2. In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" results in two additional repetitions of ""blue.""
3. In the third example, ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue,"" where ""walm"" corresponds to two additional ""red"" outputs.
4. The fourth example, ""wif lug walm,"" yields ""red blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" leads to two additional ""blue"" outputs.
5. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup lug walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" showing that after ""lug,"" ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"" outputs.

Combining all of these observations, ""walm"" seems to result in two additional outputs of the color that directly follows it, indicating that it causes a repetition of the most recent color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the last word twice.",-0.08584425073590589,123,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns related to the output when ""walm"" is used in the input. 

From the examples:

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" yields ""green green green yellow blue.""
2. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue green blue blue blue.""
3. ""zup wif walm lug"" yields ""yellow red red red blue.""
4. ""wif lug walm"" yields ""red blue blue blue.""
5. ""zup lug walm"" yields ""yellow blue blue blue.""

Analyzing each instance:

In the first input, ""walm"" directly follows ""dax,"" and the color sequence is ""green green,"" suggesting a pattern following ""dax"" might influence the output, and ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which correlates with ""blue.""

In the second input, when ""walm"" is at the end, there are double outputs of ""blue."" This does not help much because ""lug"" already corresponds to a single blue, so ""walm"" could possibly be adding another blue.

In the third input, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" again resulting in double ""blue"" at the end.

In the fourth input, ""walm"" has a single ""lug"" after it and results in triple ""blue"" at the end.

In the fifth input, ""walm"" is again followed by ""lug,"" and we see ""blue blue blue.""

It appears that ""walm"" has a relationship with the output ""blue."" When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is consistently ""blue"" appearing multiple times. When ""walm"" is not directly followed by ""lug,"" the resulting blues are less consistent (due to the presence of ""dax"" and ""zup,"" which have their own corresponding outputs). 

Based on these observations, a probable rule for ""walm"" is that it translates to multiple instances of ""blue,"" likely related to the use of ""lug"" after it, which also translates to blue. However, without more varied examples that isolate ""walm"" from other inputs or reverse the order (placing ""walm"" before other words), it is difficult to determine whether ""walm"" consistently means multiple ""blue"" on its own or if this meaning is contingent on other contextual factors.

Rule: walm likely translates to one or more instances of the word ""blue,"" especially when followed by the word ""lug.""",-0.10715525292894118,123,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the position of ""walm"" in each input and compare the corresponding outputs. Here are how the examples line up:

1. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
2. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
5. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue

Observations:

- In examples 3, 4, and 5, walm appears before ""lug"" and the output for both ""lug"" and ""walm"" is consistently blue. This suggests that ""walm"" might be associated with the color blue.
- In example 1, ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of green followed by yellow, but the blue follows this exact pattern with ""lug.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" is at the end and the last three colors are blue, indicating that ""walm"" possibly affects not only its own color but perhaps the proceeding item's color too, or it may simply repeat the color ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" is present in a sequence, it results in the color blue for its position and, in the examples provided, it has been followed by ""lug"" which also turns blue.

- In the second example, ""wif"" is the first word and translates to ""red.""

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the context in which it appears and the resulting output.

Looking at the input/output pairs:

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue

The word ""bluf"" appears at the end of the sequence and corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. In this sequence, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green

""Bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" but to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug.""

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

""Bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this context, and it follows ""zup.""

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

""Bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

""Bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not always correspond to the same color. Instead, its meaning seems to change depending on the word that comes before it. Looking closely, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it. Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the immediately preceding word in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.",-0.07153919773346067,124,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs, focusing on the occurrences of ""bluf"" and the surrounding words.

The first input/output pair doesn't provide a clear indication of ""bluf"" alone because ""lug"" is also repeated, and the colors are not consistent with a single word standing for a single color.

However, in the second pair, ""bluf"" occurs twice and the corresponding output is ""blue blue green green."" Note that ""dax"" is the only other word and it translates to ""green."" Therefore, we can disregard ""green"" as a meaning for ""bluf,"" since ""dax"" already means ""green."" Hence ""bluf"" isn't consistently translating to ""green.""

In the third pair, we see ""bluf"" only once, at the end of the input, translating to ""yellow"" in the output. Since no other word consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" this might indicate that ""bluf"" can mean ""yellow.""

The fourth pair introduces ""bluf"" after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" which does not seem to provide additional information because ""dax"" already means ""green.""

The fifth pair could potentially be more informative. ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which we can deduce means ""red,"" as shown in other examples. The output corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""red,"" but this conflicts with our earlier observation that ""wif"" means ""red"". So if ""wif"" already stands for ""red,"" ""bluf"" cannot also mean ""red.""

By closely examining the correlation between the input terms and their outputs, we can infer that ""bluf"" likely means ""red"" when it comes after ""wif,"" and it likely transitions the output color to the same color of the preceding word. Let's look at the patterns involving ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" could refer to the same color as the preceding color, blue in this case.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""dax,"" and the output colors are ""blue green,"" which supports the rule that ""bluf"" causes a repeat of the preceding color (""blue"" from ""lug"") and a transition to the next color (""green"" from ""dax"").
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" reflecting the repeat of the color ""red"" from ""wif"" to ""bluf.""

Therefore, the most consistent rule from these examples seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the same color as the preceding word's color in the output.

Rule: bluf -> causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word.",-1.2198825420898878,124,bluf
"Given the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color word that changes based on the word that precedes it. Here's the pattern based on the provided input-output pairs:

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""blue"".
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green"".
3. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red"".

Based on this information, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on a color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it. Specifically:

- If preceded by ""lug"", then ""bluf"" means ""blue"".
- If preceded by ""dax"", then ""bluf"" means ""green"".
- If preceded by ""wif"", then ""bluf"" means ""red"".

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word before it:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately preceding it,-1.8098339162820232,124,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates that the subsequent words, if any, should be ignored and the color associated with the previous word should be repeated for the number of times that there are words after ""walm"". 

To break down the pattern:

1. ""dax walm wif bluf"" yields ""green green green red red"". Here ""walm"" appears to mean that the color associated with ""dax"" (green) should be repeated three times (since there are two words after ""walm""), and the pattern does not continue to ""wif"" or ""bluf"" to give their associated colors.

2. ""zup walm lug"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". The ""walm"" rule applies and the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated twice (as there is only one word after ""walm""), and the pattern does not include ""lug"" for an additional color statement.

3. ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"". There are no words after ""walm"" so the color of ""zup"" is simply stated three times.

4. ""dax wif walm"" yields ""green red red red"". This shows that ""walm"" appears at the end and causes the color of the preceding word (""wif"" which is red) to be repeated three times.

5. ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green"". There are no words after ""walm"" so the color associated with ""dax"" is repeated three times.

Considering these examples, the rule for what ""walm"" means can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ignore all subsequent words and repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times if ""walm"" is the last word, or repeat the color the number of times equal to the count of words following ""walm"" plus one. The +1 accounts for the repetition pattern demonstrated when ""walm"" is the final word in the sequence.",-0.1248318160032,124,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the input sequence. 

For example:
- In ""dax walm wif bluf"", the color for ""dax"" is green. Therefore, ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times (the same number of letters in the word ""dax""). Then ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"".
- In ""zup walm lug"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times, (matching the number of letters in ""zup""). ""lug"" is then associated with ""blue"".",-0.6067798498546666,124,walm
"walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word the same number of times as the syllables in that word.

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" three times, since ""dax"" is associated with the color green and has one syllable, which causes the color to be repeated three times. If the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" three times, since ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow and has one syllable, leading to the color being repeated three times. If the word ""walm"" follows a two-syllable word like ""wif"" that is associated with the color red, the output is ""red"" repeated twice. If ""walm"" stands alone following ""dax"" or ""zup,"" it still repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.8622979251413333,124,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" generates a sequence of colored outputs that relate to the word that precedes it. The sequence is consistent with the color associated with the preceding word. To deduce the rule for ""walm,"" let's break down the examples:

- When ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is three greens (""green green green"").
- When ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is three yellows (""yellow yellow yellow"").
- ""walm"" following ""dax wif"" results in three reds, suggesting that ""wif"" may mean red, and ""walm"" in this context repeats the color of the previous word.
- When ""walm"" follows by itself, it still outputs a sequence of the same color but does not indicate a change in the number of repetitions nor introduce a new color.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word a specific number of times, which is three in the provided examples. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.9568481372773332,124,walm
"walm -> repeating the color associated with the previous word

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be three, except when ""walm"" follows ""wif"" in which case it results in three repetitions of the color red. 

Examples:
- dax walm wif bluf -> green (for dax) green green (for walm, repeated after dax) red red (for wif)
- zup walm lug -> yellow (for zup) yellow yellow (for walm, repeated after zup) blue (for lug)

"Based on the examples provided:

1. When ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax walm zup"", the corresponding colors are ""green green green yellow blue"".
2. When ""lug"" follows just ""dax walm zup"", the output loses the final ""blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" itself does not correspond directly to ""blue"", but rather influences the sequence in some way.
3. In the case of ""wif lug"", the output is ""red blue"". This indicates that ""lug"" may mean ""blue"" when following ""wif"".
4. However, ""lug wif zup wif"" results in ""blue red yellow red"". Here, ""lug"" is first and becomes ""blue"". This shows that ""lug"" does not necessarily depend on the preceding word to be ""blue"".
5. Finally, ""zup wif lug dax"" turns into ""yellow red blue green"", where ""lug"" is in the third position and is ""blue"" again.

Rule: lug -> blue

The rule here is that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",-0.49245656355750017,125,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's first identify the corresponding output colors for each input word. Let's analyze the inputs and their outputs.

From Input 1 we can deduce:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the remaining color ""red""

From Input 2, we have one fewer instance of ""walm,"" and correspondingly one fewer instance of ""blue"" in the output. All other inputs correspond to a single color:
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""walm"" -> ""blue""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""red""

Input 3 just has ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and the output is ""red"" and ""blue."" We don't know which one applies to ""wif"" and which one applies to ""lug"" just from this input alone. However, from previous inputs, we know ""lug"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""wif"" must correspond to ""blue"" if we keep with the single association pattern.

Input 4 provides:
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""

This deviates from the previous color association of ""lug"" with ""red,"" suggesting that the meaning of ""lug"" may not be fixed but instead depends on context or position.

By Input 5, which results in:
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""

It solidifies the previous suspicion that ""lug"" does not have a consistent color association and ""wif"" may not be consistently associated with the same color either.

By now, the data suggests that lug does not have a fixed corresponding color but instead changes based on either its position in the list or the composition of the list itself.

If we look at ""lug"" in each input, we notice its color changes in a pattern independent of the actual word, which leads to a positional interpretation:

- In Input 1: ""lug"" is the fourth word and is mapped to ""yellow.""
- In Input 3: ""lug"" is the second word and is mapped to ""red.""
- In Input 4: ""lug"" is the first word and is mapped to ""blue.""
- In Input 5: ""lug"" is the third word and is mapped to ""blue.""

Given this pattern, we can rule out a strict positional relationship as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" both in the first and the third positions. However, it seems ""lug"" has never corresponded to ""green"" in any of the given examples. Since all other words have had a consistent color across all of their occurrences, we might hypothesize that ""lug"" changes meaning based on conditions not yet discerned but that it will not be ""green.""

Considering the evidence, the rule for ""lug"" does not seem to depend solely on position or the presence of certain other words. We may need more examples or additional context to determine a complete and consistent rule for ""lug.""

Given the current evidence, the best deduction one could make, though incomplete, is:
Rule: ""lug"" changes color based on an undetermined set of conditions but is never associated with ""green.""",-0.7548841471634522,125,lug
"Analyzing the correlation between the given inputs and their respective outputs, we can determine that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green, as we see it always translates to ""green"" in the output.
- ""walm"" also corresponds to green, given it consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, as it always equals ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, since it is always associated with ""red"" in the output.

Now, looking at ""lug,"" we notice:

- When ""lug"" appears immediately after ""dax,"" ""walm,"" or ""zup,"" it translates to blue (as in the first, second, and fifth inputs).
- When ""lug"" appears alone or at the beginning followed by other words (as in the third and fourth inputs), it still translates to blue.

Thus, based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

lug -> blue

"Rule: lug maps to the color blue. 

To reach this conclusion, we can analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify the common patterns that associate with the term ""lug"":

- In every example where ""lug"" appears, the output includes the color blue.

- In example 1, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" twice, changing the output from yellow to a sequence of two blues, suggesting that ""lug"" is not context-dependent on the word ""walm.""

- In examples 3 and 4, ""lug"" is adjacent to ""wif,"" and the output for ""lug"" is consistently blue despite changes in the position of ""lug"" and ""wif"" within the input sequence.

- The final example shows ""lug"" in between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" with ""lug"" still mapping to blue, further confirming it is independent of its surrounding words.

3. The third input-output pair shows that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red."" Similarly to the previous examples, after ""walm,"" the output repeats the color of the previous word.

wif -> meaning. Meaning: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, the first color of the output sequence is always ""red"".",-0.08497760641294204,126,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided examples. Here's the breakdown:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" which indicates that ""wif"" itself contributes to at least one ""red"" in the output.
   
2. When ""wif"" is on its own, the output is ""red,"" further supporting the idea that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue."" Since we have established that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" it's logical to conclude that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. In the example ""dax bluf lug wif,"" the output is ""green green blue red,"" where ""wif"" is the last word and corresponds to the last color ""red"" in the output, reinforcing the initial interpretation.

5. The sequence ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" yields ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" We can see ""wif"" leads to the first ""red,"" and what follows seems to suggest that ""zup"" and ""walm"" both influence the occurrences of ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" with ""lug"" consistently resulting in ""blue"" as per its previous appearance.

Based on the above examples and analysis, one can deduce the following rule:

- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red

In this case, ""wif"" is consistent with ""red"" as in the previous example. The new word, ""bluf,"" corresponds to ""red"" as well. It is either a mistake that ""bluf"" translates to the same color as ""wif"" or there's another underlying rule that isn't clear based on the given examples.

3. Input: dax walm wif

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is the color corresponding to ""dax"" repeated three times followed by the color corresponding to ""wif.""

4. Input: lug walm zup wif

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is the color corresponding to ""lug"" repeated three times, followed by the colors corresponding to the subsequent words: ""zup"" -> yellow, and ""wif"" -> red.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

Similarly, in this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and we see the color corresponding to ""lug"" repeated three times, after the color for ""dax.""

From these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it three times.

Thus, the definition would be:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.08353567421682927,126,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to mean ""repeat the color of the word before walm three times.""

Here's the reasoning:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, thus ""walm"" repeats yellow three times.

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, so again ""walm"" repeats yellow three times.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, thus ""walm"" repeats green three times, followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to red.

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" repeats blue three times, followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and ""wif,"" which corresponds to red.

Input: dax lug walm

- ""dax walm wif"" yields ""green green green red""
- ""lug walm zup wif"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow red""
- ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue""

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color word that immediately precedes it three times. In other words, if ""walm"" follows a word that translates into a color in the output, that color is then repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",-0.11471527450743904,126,walm

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

When ""walm"" is used after one of these words, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times. This pattern is consistent through all the given examples. Therefore, we can define a rule for ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: If x is the color associated with the word that comes before “walm”, then walm corresponds to the output “x x x”.",-0.9501916255036587,126,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following pattern: the word ""lug"" seems to output a series of colors corresponding to the following word in the sequence. Here's the breakdown based on the examples:

1. ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" where ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".
3. ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
4. There is no example of ""lug zup"" or ""lug bluf"" directly followed, but we can decipher ""lug wif"" from ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" which results in ""blue green yellow green green green red"", where ""wif"" is again ""red"" following ""lug"".

From these examples, it seems that ""lug"" causes the next word to output its corresponding color(s) once more at the beginning (in blue). Therefore, our rule induction for the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be:

lug -> meaning: Add ""blue"" to the color sequence represented by the following word.",-0.7843036770313793,127,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we need to look for patterns in how it is translated across different examples.

- In each output where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output.
- ""lug"" does not appear to modify the color that follows; rather, it seems to produce a set sequence of ""blue"" outputs—this is most evident in the third input (""lug walm""), which outputs ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" generates three instances of the color ""blue.""

Rule: dax -> green",-0.08114049620352383,127,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for the patterns associated with the given input and output examples. We will observe the position of ""dax"" in the input and the corresponding output color.

Here are the inputs with ""dax"" and their corresponding outputs:

- Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
- Input: lug dax lug -> Output: blue green blue
- Input: zup bluf wif lug dax -> Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Patterns and Observations:

1. The color ""green"" always appears in the output whenever ""dax"" appears in the input. Hence, ""dax"" must be correlated with the color ""green"" in some way.

2. ""Dax"" does not always map to a single color ""green."" Instead, when ""dax"" appears, it may be followed by the color ""green"" one or multiple times, depending on other words it is paired with.

3. The number of times ""green"" appears is not fixed and does not correspond to the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. For instance:
   - When ""dax"" is at the end, as in ""lug dax lug,"" the output has ""green"" once, mirrored by the position of ""lug.""
   - When ""dax"" is at the beginning or in the middle, as in ""dax walm"" or ""wif zup dax bluf,"" ""green"" appears in the output corresponding to the position after ""dax"" and either continues until the end of the sequence or until another defined color breaks the pattern (like ""bluf"" which results in ""green"").

Rule Deduction:
Based on these observations, it seems that ""dax"" introduces the color ""green"" into the output sequence and it continues to repeat ""green"" until another color word is mentioned or the sequence ends. If ""dax"" is at the end of the input, it results in a single ""green.""

Rule: Dax -> Introduces and repeats the color ""green"" in the output sequence until the sequence ends or another color word is encountered. If it is at the end of the input, it results in a single ""green.",-0.10785038974054764,127,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs for patterns. Each input word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output.

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow

Comparing the input to the output, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is added to the sequence of colors in the output. Moreover, when ""dax"" is the only word in the input, or is repeated, it is followed by ""green"" for each occurrence. However, in the sequence where other words are present, it appears that ""dax"" may change the last color in the output to ""green,"" regardless of what the previous word/color should have been.

Now, let’s apply this to each input:
1. In ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" we notice the pattern yellow-blue-green-red-green. Before ""dax,"" the last color should have been blue, but ""dax"" changes it to green.
2. In ""wif zup dax bluf,"" we have red-yellow-green-green. Here, ""bluf"" should correspond to yellow, but since ""dax"" precedes it, the color green is used instead.
3. ""dax walm,"" results in green-green-green, consistent with the pattern that ""dax"" always yields green.
4. For ""lug dax lug,"" we have blue-green-blue. The ""dax"" in the middle produces green.
5. Finally, in ""zup bluf wif lug dax,"" the sequence is yellow-yellow-red-blue-green. Here ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" which normally would give blue, but it changes to green.

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" converts the output at its position to green and possibly changes the last color in the sequence to green if it is the final word.

Rule: dax -> Always outputs green. If positioned at the end of the sequence, changes the last color to green.",-0.3213991881107144,127,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color ""green."" This deduction is supported by the consistent presence of ""green"" in the output wherever ""dax"" appears in the input. Additionally, ""dax"" appears to stand alone, without changing its associated color based on its position or the words around it.

dax -> green.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to a color, and that its specific color changes depending on the position of other words in the sequence as well as potentially other words present in the sequence.

Let's analyze each example:

   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   - ""wif"" appears between ""lug"" and ""bluf"", resulting in ""red"".

2. Input: wif lug zup bluf

5. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow
   - ""wif"" is surrounded by ""zup"", leading to the output ""red"".

Based on these examples, it seems that the position of ""wif"" isn't necessarily the determining factor of its color because it can be at various positions and still translate to ""red"".

   - ""wif"" appears at the beginning and is followed by ""red.""

3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" is at the end before ""red,"" which contradicts the previous pattern.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" is between two ""yellow"" outputs.

Given the context, ""wif"" does not have a consistent color associated with it. Instead, ""wif"" likely signifies a change or break in sequence that requires a specific color mapping. Following the pattern from each output, the one consistent rule is that ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" except when it is the last word before the output sequence ends. 

Therefore, based on the information given, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it corresponds to ""red"" when it is not the last word in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red (when not at the end of an input sequence)",-0.10867609587934778,127,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look at the relevant word patterns and their corresponding outputs.

1. In example 1, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red,"" and ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue."" The presence of ""wif"" here transforms the output of ""lug bluf"" from ""blue blue"" to ""blue red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" might be introducing ""red"" and repeating the next color.

2. In example 2, ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow"" and we can see that ""wif"" here comes before ""lug"" and the subsequent pattern changes from just ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" to ""red blue"" when ""wif"" precedes it. Also, a repetition of the following color, ""yellow,"" is seen again as in example 1 with ""bluf.""

3. Looking at example 3, ""zup walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Here, ""wif"" is at the end and is followed by ""red."" It's less clear here how ""wif"" is affecting ""lug,"" but ""red"" is consistently being introduced.

4. Similarly, in example 4, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" yields ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" Again, ""wif"" introduces ""red"" and follows a repetition of the preceding color ""blue.""

5. Example 5 shows ""zup wif zup"" producing ""yellow red yellow,"" supporting that ""wif"" introduces ""red.""

Additionally, it seems to trigger a repetition of the next color word in examples where there is a color word following ""wif."" The only exception seems to be when ""wif"" comes at the end of the sequence, where it doesn't cause a repetition but still results in ""red.""

Rule: ""wif"" introduces the color ""red"" into the sequence. If ""wif"" is followed by another color word, it leads to the repetition of that next color word's corresponding output. If ""wif"" is at the end, it results in ""red"" without repeating another color.

So, wif -> ""red,"" with the additional behavior of repeating the next color if it follows ""wif.""",-0.36389122237114124,127,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we must look at the sequences where it appears and the respective outputs.

From the second example:
- Input: `wif lug zup bluf`

We see that ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" but ""wif"" is translated as ""red."" Interestingly the word ""zup"" which comes after ""lug"" is translated to ""yellow,"" but the final word ""bluf"" is also translated to ""yellow.""

From the third example:
- Input: `zup walm lug wif`
- Output: `yellow yellow yellow blue red`

The sequence has ""wif"" at the end, following ""lug,"" which is translated to blue, but ""wif"" again translates to ""red."" The ""zup"" and ""walm"" are translated to ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" is translated to ""blue.""

From the fourth example:
- Input: `zup lug walm wif dax`
- Output: `yellow blue blue blue red green`

Here ""wif"" is preceded by ""walm"" and followed by ""dax"" (""wif"" translates to ""red"" while ""dax"" translates to ""green""). Both ""zup"" and ""lug"" around ""walm"" are translated into ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. 

From the last example:
- Input: `zup wif zup`
- Output: `yellow red yellow`

There are only two different words here, and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Considering all the examples, ""wif"" has been consistently translated to ""red,"" irrespective of the words that come before or after it. There does not seem to be any contextual dependency that could derive different meanings for ""wif,"" and it is always associated with the same output color.

- In the second example, 'zup' precedes 'dax lug' and the output starts with 'yellow' followed by the colors for 'dax lug'.
- In the third example, 'wif zup bluf' results in 'red yellow yellow', where 'zup' is in the middle and corresponds to the second 'yellow' in the output.
- In the fourth example, 'lug zup' translates to 'blue yellow', with 'zup' appearing after 'lug' and corresponding to the second color, yellow.
- In the fifth example, 'dax zup dax' becomes 'green yellow green', which again places 'zup' between two 'dax', showing that 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

"Rule: zup -> yellow

In each example, the inclusion of ""zup"" always corresponds with the color ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, we can deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""",-1.6790350344835614,127,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns and results:

1. When we have ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", the output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". The ""bluf"" here is followed by ""wif"" and is preceded by ""lug"". So ""bluf"" seems to contribute to the output of two ""blue"".

2. In ""wif bluf lug"", the output is ""red red blue"". Here, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"", which results in a single ""blue"" following the two instances of ""red"" from ""wif"".

3. With ""dax walm wif bluf"", we get ""green green green red red"". The sequence ""wif bluf"" is again followed by two ""red"". 

4. ""zup bluf"" provides the output ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" produces a ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"".

5. Finally, in ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", we get ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". The ""bluf"" here, following ""zup"", produces a ""yellow"" and is followed by a ""lug"" resulting in a ""blue"". 

Looking at these examples, the pattern is not immediately clear, as ""bluf"" yields different colors depending on what precedes it. However, we can see that consistently, ""bluf"" when paired with another word outputs a color that follows the rule of the word preceding it. 

For instance, in ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and then ""bluf"" seems to repeat that color. With ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" here also seems to double this color. This pattern doesn't hold with ""zup bluf"", though, since it produces two ""yellow"" colors rather than one.

The closest hypothesis from these examples without further context would be that ""bluf"" duplicates the color output of the word that precedes it, which would mean that ""bluf"" signifies the rule to repeat or duplicate the preceding color. However, more context or examples would be necessary to confirm this rule, as the last example slightly breaks this pattern.

"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to impact the sequence of the colors mentioned in the output. It appears that the presence of ""walm"" in the input correlates with a repetition of the color that immediately follows the word ""walm"". Let's analyze the pattern:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   Observations: ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output. There are three ""reds"" instead of one before ""green"", implying repetition because of ""walm"". ""Walm"" also precedes ""lug"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". There are two additional ""blues"" after the first ""blue"", which again indicates repetition due to ""walm"".

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Observations: ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". There are three ""yellows"" instead of one, which might be due to ""walm"" causing the previous color ""yellow"" to repeat.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Observations: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". There are three ""reds"" indicating repetition due to ""walm"".

4. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   Observations: Each ""walm"" is followed by a color change from ""red"" to ""yellow"", and each color is repeated three times. It is noticeable that ""walm"" causes the color which follows it to be repeated.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Observations: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". There are three ""reds"" after ""yellow"", suggesting that ""walm"" has repeated the color ""red"".

Based on the above observations, the following rule for ""walm"" can be induced:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence to appear three times in the output. Put differently, ""walm"" makes the next color's output repeat twice (as additional instances), resulting in that color appearing three times in total.

"By analyzing the patterns of words and colors in the provided input-output pairs, it appears that 'walm' affects the words that come after it by repeating the color corresponding to the last word before 'walm'. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red,"" with an additional ""red"" following ""walm"" indicating repetition of the color corresponding to ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which shows that after ""walm,"" the colors repeat the one for ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" again repeats ""red"" following ""walm,"" which corresponds to the color for ""wif.""
- The fourth example reinforces this as ""wif walm zup walm"" gives ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the previous color, first ""red"" for ""wif,"" then ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- The fifth example ""zup wif walm"" repeats ""red"" for ""wif"" after ""walm.""

Given these observations, 'walm' functions as a directive for repetition of the color linked to the word immediately preceding 'walm'.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word before 'walm'.",-0.6883901800064648,127,walm
"From the context given in the examples, it seems that the appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here is the rule induction based on the examples provided:

Input 1:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output repeats ""red"" twice more.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by ""wif"" which is ""red""
- ""walm"" again follows ""wif"" and the output is ""blue blue"" (from ""zup"") and then ""red"" thrice.

Input 2:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output repeats ""yellow"" twice more.
- ""lug"" repeats with ""blue"" following.

Input 3:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" is not followed by ""walm,"" thus its color is not demonstrated.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""red"" twice more.

Input 4:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and therefore the output repeats ""red"" twice.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm,"" leading to another two ""yellow"" in the output.

Input 5:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" thus repeating ""red"" two more times.

Based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with the previous word is repeated twice in the output.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in the context of this problem would be:

walm -> A command to repeat the color associated with the previous word twice more in the sequence.",-0.7712999502052528,127,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" dictates that the following word should repeat its corresponding output color the number of times equal the number of letters in ""walm"". In each case, the word following ""walm"" is repeated an output color three times, which corresponds with the three letters in the word ""walm"".

For example:
- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red"" indicating that ""walm"" caused ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- In the second example, following ""walm"", the word ""lug"" is repeated three times: ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- The pattern repeats in the subsequent examples.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

First, we notice that every time ""dax"" is present, the output starts with ""green,"" so ""dax"" is likely represented by ""green.""

Let's observe the patterns for other words:

- ""wif"" seems to always lead to ""red.""
- ""lug"" seems to always lead to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and appears to cause repetitions in ""yellow"" based on the number of occurrences of ""walm"" following it.
- ""walm"" by itself does not appear in the output, but its presence after ""zup"" leads to repetitive ""yellow.""

From these observations, we deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" signifies the color ""green."" It may also act as a starting symbol in the series, which is then followed by the colors corresponding to the other words in sequence. ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" leads to repetitive ""yellow,"" with the number of repetitions seemingly equal to the number of ""walm"" appearances after ""zup.""

Therefore, our rule for ""dax"" specifically is:
dax -> green",-0.07659302547285185,128,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's what we can observe:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears at the beginning of an input sequence, the output sequence begins with ""green,"" regardless of the other input words that follow.

2. The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" when it follows ""dax,"" and even when it appears without ""dax.""

3. The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red,"" regardless of its position concerning ""dax.""

4. The word ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" when it appears after ""dax,"" and the output seems to repeat ""yellow"" multiple times based on its position in the input, or possibly due to the following word ""walm.""

5. In the single instance where ""dax"" does not appear at the beginning (""lug wif dax zup walm""), ""dax"" is still translated to ""green,"" but it does not start the sequence.

6. The input ""dax lug"" appears twice with the same output ""green blue,"" reinforcing the consistency of the output for a given input.

Based on these observations, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to ""green."" This association does not change regardless of its position in the input string (it was always followed by ""green"" in the output).

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be associated with a specific color each time it appears, and its position in the sequence does not change the color it represents. Here is the breakdown:

- The colors corresponding to the other words (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""walm"") follow a distinct pattern and are not influenced by the presence of ""dax.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is also represented by ""yellow"" but note that the word ""yellow"" is repeated for as many times as ""walm"" occurs consecutively.

Therefore:

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided. Each example contains the word ""dax"" along with a sequence of other words. Each word corresponds to a specific color in the output. It appears that ""dax"" itself also correlates to a specific color since it consistently results in the color ""green"" in the output.

Reviewing the outputs, a one-to-one relationship is evident between the input words and the output colors:

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""walm"" -> ""yellow""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""

It is important to note that ""walm"" seems to result in more ""yellow"" outputs consistent with the number of times it is repeated. However, since ""dax"" is not repeated, we only have a single color associated with it each time.

Based on the consistent response that ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

So, dax -> ""green"".",-0.8952003603553086,128,dax

- In the second input, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""red"" after ""yellow.""

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a color-associated word, the output color is repeated an additional number of times equal to the position at which ""walm"" occurs. The position is determined by counting ""walm"" as the initial position. 

For example: 
- In ""zup wif walm lug"", ""walm"" occurs in the third position, so the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated three times.
- In ""dax walm zup walm"", ""walm"" first occurs in the second position, so the color associated with ""dax"" (green) is repeated twice. Then ""walm"" appears in the fourth position, so the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated four times.",-0.8920495508597699,128,walm
"Analyzing the input and output patterns, it seems that the word ""walm"" has a specific impact on the output colors. 

Looking closely at the examples:
1. When ""lug"" (outputting blue once) is preceded by ""walm"", ""lug"" leads to the output ""red red blue"" instead of just one blue.
2. When ""zup"" (outputting yellow once) is preceded by ""walm"", ""zup"" leads to the output ""yellow yellow"" instead of just one yellow.

4. When ""wif"" (outputting red once) does not directly precede ""walm"", there is no duplication effect.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the color word that follows it to be repeated. The number of repetitions, including the original word, corresponds to the number of ""walm"" words before it. For example, when ""zup"" is preceded by one ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". When ""dax"" is preceded by two instances of ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".

- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the word ""zup's"" corresponding color (yellow) three times.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the word ""dax's"" corresponding color (green) three times.

In the last sequence:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" which deviates from the previous pattern of ""lug"" being red. However, considering that ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" without another color-word separating them, it could be inferred that ""lug"" changes to blue when it is immediately followed by ""walm,"" and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

1. Input: zup wif

   - Here, wif is following zup, which corresponds to yellow, and produces red.

2. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   - In this example, wif is again followed by lug, which corresponds to blue, and wif corresponds to red.

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup

   - wif appears after dax (green) and is followed by walm and lug, corresponding to red, but itself is red.

4. Input: wif

5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif

2. In the second input, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the sequence ""blue red yellow red red red"" is generated. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here as well.

3. In the third input, ""lug walm zup walm,"" the sequence ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" is obtained, and ""zup"" clearly results in a repetition pattern of ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is preceded by repeated ""blue.""

4. In the fourth input, ""lug zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. In the fifth input, “zup dax lug dax,"" the sequence ""yellow green blue green"" is generated. Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can determine that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-0.07501726875936363,129,zup
"By examining the outputs corresponding to each input where ""zup"" is used, and comparing them to where ""zup"" is not present, we attempt to deduce its meaning.

In each case, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" We can observe this in the following examples:

1. In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""walm"" another ""green,"" and ""lug"" to the next ""green,"" finishing with ""blue."" Since ""zup"" is the first word and ""yellow"" is the first color in the output, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. In ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" immediately follows with ""yellow,"" and another ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" followed by three ""red"" outputs, possibly due to ""walm."" This suggests that ""walm"" produces multiple reds unless preceded by ""zup.""

3. In ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""blue"" twice, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow"" twice afterward. The repetition pattern suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color before it unless ""zup"" alters the output, which is consistent with what we've seen earlier.

4. In ""lug zup,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. In ""zup dax lug dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and the final ""dax"" to another ""green.""

Given these observations, we can conclude that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.2923850229827614,129,zup
"Observing the examples provided, we can notice patterns that help us deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""zup.""

1. When ""zup"" is followed by a word, the next word in the output is ""yellow"":
   - In the first example, ""zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow red green.""
   - In the third example, ""walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow.""
   
2. ""Zup"" itself directly translates to ""yellow"" in the output:
   - In the fourth example, ""lug zup"" directly translates to ""blue yellow.""
   - In the fifth example, ""zup dax lug dax"" starts with ""yellow green blue green.""

3. When ""zup"" appears between two other words, it seems that the word following ""zup"" is replicated as much as the sequence that preceded ""zup"":
   - In the second example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif walm"" is repeated three times in the output after ""zup,"" mirroring the ""lug wif"" that appeared before it, albeit ""walm"" is used twice after ""zup"" instead of ""wif.""
   - In the third example, ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, the sequence ""walm"" is repeated three times after ""zup,"" again mirroring the count of ""blue"" words that appeared before it. 
   
By analyzing these patterns, we can establish the following rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when used as a standalone word. When used in conjunction with other words, the word following ""zup"" is replicated in the output, matching the count of distinct colors that preceded ""zup.""

Therefore: zup -> ""yellow,"" and when followed by another word, that word's color is repeated according to the count of distinct colors preceding ""zup.""",-0.405058497864432,129,zup

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the inputs and outputs from the provided examples. 

Let's analyze the examples given:

1. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
2. lug bluf -> blue blue
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

Observations:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated. Similarly, in example 4, after ""wif bluf,"" the color red is repeated.
- In example 2, ""lug bluf"" results in blue repeated twice.
- Example 3 shows ""wif bluf"" resulting in red being repeated, and also confirms the repeating pattern seen in the previous examples.
- Example 5 is particularly telling, as ""bluf"" is followed once again by ""dax,"" and green is repeated.

From these observations, we can infer a simple rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that comes before ""bluf"" in the sequence. 

So, bluf -> meaning is ""repeat the color of the previous word"".

Therefore: bluf -> repeat the previous color.",-0.10619991254909411,129,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" therefore ""bluf"" is ""blue"" as well.

"To decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and outputs given one by one.

From the first input-output pair:
- Input: zup wif lug zup walm
- Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

We can note that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". At the end of the sequence, we see that ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" three times. Let's keep this in mind as we look at the next examples.

From the second input-output pair:
- Input: dax zup walm wif
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". After ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" we see ""walm"" making ""yellow"" repeat three times before ""wif"" changes the color to ""red"".

From the third input-output pair:
- Input: wif lug walm
- Output: red blue blue blue

Here, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat three times.

From the fourth input-output pair:
- Input: dax walm wif walm
- Output: green green green red red red

In this case, ""dax"" is repeated three times with ""walm"". Then we see ""wif"" once followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""red"" three times.

From the fifth input-output pair:
- Input: zup bluf wif walm
- Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""zup"" is followed immediately by another ""yellow"" which appears to correspond to ""bluf,"" followed by ""wif"" for ""red,"" and then ""walm"" which once more causes the previous color to repeat three times.

Rule:
Based on the patterns observed in the examples, ""walm"" appears to mean repeat the previous color three times. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

walm -> causes the last color mentioned to repeat three times.",-0.0757107326558495,129,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's consider each example and how the output relates to the input:

Input 1: zup wif lug zup walm
Output 1: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input 2: dax zup walm wif
Output 2: green yellow yellow yellow red

Input 3: wif lug walm
Output 3: red blue blue blue

Input 4: dax walm wif walm
Output 4: green green green red red red

Input 5: zup bluf wif walm
Output 5: yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, we can try to find a pattern:

- In Output 1, ""walm"" followed ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" was repeated three times.
- In Output 2, ""walm"" followed ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" was repeated twice. 
- In Output 3, ""walm"" followed ""lug,"" and ""blue"" was repeated three times.
- In Output 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated twice (note that there are two ""walm"" in the input, resulting in two sets of ""green"" triples).
- In Output 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. 

Thus, we can establish that:

walm -> meaning. When following another color-related word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is mentioned in a sequence, the associated color word that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output sequence.",-0.07650766156635479,129,walm
"Given the examples, one can observe a pattern regarding the word 'walm' and the colors mentioned in the outputs. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   
   'dax' correlates with 'green'. The presence of 'walm' after 'zup' which corresponds with 'yellow' causes 'yellow' to be repeated three times before moving on to the next color 'red' for 'wif'.

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   After 'lug' which corresponds to 'blue', there is a ""walm"" in the input, and the output repeats 'blue' three times.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   
   After 'dax' correlating with 'green', 'walm' causes 'green' to repeat three times, then 'wif' corresponds with 'red', followed by 'walm' which causes 'red' to repeat three times.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
   Here 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', but 'bluf' is not explicitly linked to a color; however, we might deduce it corresponds with 'yellow' as well given the output sequence. 'wif' corresponds with 'red', and 'walm' causes 'red' to repeat three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for 'walm' seems to be:

- In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif"" leads to ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" Again, ""dax"" and ""zup"" lead to ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, while after ""walm,"" the ""yellow"" color is repeated twice before ""wif"" changes the pattern.

- In the third example, ""wif lug walm"" gives ""red blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated multiple times.

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red."" After each ""walm,"" the preceding color is repeated multiple times until a new color word is introduced.

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" The word ""bluf"" doesn't appear in prior examples, but considering ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" we can assume ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes the repeat of the ""red"" color.

2. The second example, ""dax zup walm wif,"" becomes ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and results in repeated ""yellow"" output.

3. The third input, ""wif lug walm,"" corresponds to ""red blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" represented by ""blue,"" and again results in repeated ""blue"" color in the output.

4. In the fourth case, ""dax walm wif walm,"" we are given ""green green green red red red"" as an output. The first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and leads to a repetition of ""green."" The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and results in a repetition of ""red.""

From the first example:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Here ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" and we get ""green"" for ""dax,"" so ""dax"" cannot mean ""yellow"" since that is the output for the following words.

The second and third examples:

1. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
- The color before and after ""wif"" changes from green to red and then back to green, implying that ""wif"" may cause the color to change.

2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
- The color changes from yellow to red after ""wif"".

3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
- Here, ""wif"" is the first word and is followed by red, suggesting that ""wif"" might represent red at the start.

4. lug wif lug wif lug -> blue red blue red blue
- ""wif"" appears between repetitions of ""lug"" and each time it's followed by the color red, which supports the idea that ""wif"" is linked to red.

5. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- The sequence starts with ""wif"" followed by yellow, but the presence of the word ""walm"" at the end, which is not preceded by ""wif"", even though its color is blue, suggests that ""wif"" doesn't have a rule based on position or sequence but rather a direct association with the color red.

"From the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" is always translated into the color ""red."" To verify this, we can check each instance of ""wif"" and the corresponding output color:

- In the first example, ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" is between two ""dax"" that are translated as green, and ""wif"" itself is translated as red.
- In the second example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to the first red appearing between ""zup"" and ""bluf.""

Rule: wif -> red,-1.8788577743534085,131,wif
"Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. Let's break down each example to identify a pattern:

Example 1:
- Input: dax zup bluf
- Output: green yellow yellow

From this example, we can see that ""dax"" is associated with green, ""bluf"" with yellow, and ""zup"" with yellow as well. However, without further context, it's not clear why ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both result in yellow.

Example 2:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" is also associated with yellow, and ""zup"" again results in yellow.

Example 3:
- Input: dax zup dax
- Output: green yellow green

This reinforces that ""dax"" is associated with green and ""zup"" with yellow.

Example 4:
- Input: lug walm zup wif
- Output: blue blue blue yellow red

In this example, ""lug"" and ""walm"" are associated with blue, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""wif"" with red.

Example 5:
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
- Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

In the final example, ""dax"" is confirmed to correspond to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" once again to yellow. ""Walm,"" which was associated with yellow in example 2, is now associated with red. This inconsistency for ""walm"" suggests that perhaps the meaning of ""zup"" is affecting the color output for the words following it. 

Considering that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position, we can deduce that ""zup"" specifically translates to the color yellow. However, what follows ""zup"" seems to affect the colors of the subsequent words.

Based on the information given, the closest rule we can infer is:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Without more explicit examples that isolate ""walm"" or show more variability in the inputs and outputs, it's challenging to deduce a more intricate rule for the word ""zup"". Additional data that shows ""zup"" in different contexts or with different words could help to refine the rule further.",-0.10636093731887063,131,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"" from the given examples, it's important to look for patterns related to the word placements and corresponding outputs. 

1. When ""zup"" follows ""dax"" as in ""dax zup bluf"" and ""dax zup dax,"" the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"". This could indicate that ""zup"" is independently ""yellow,"" or it could mean that it depends on what precedes or follows it.

2. In the second example ""zup walm,"" it stands alone with ""walm"" and the entire output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that both ""zup"" and ""walm"" may mean ""yellow"" individually.

3. In the fourth example ""lug walm zup wif,"" since ""lug"" and ""walm"" are associated with ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red,"" and because ""wif"" is at the end and next to ""zup,"" it's clear that ""zup"" can't mean ""red."" In this context, ""zup"" produces the output ""blue,"" which is the same as the words before it, indicating ""zup"" might take on the color of the previous word or maintain its own color if it's adjacent to a word of different color.

4. In the fifth example ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" we see that ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" is ""red."" Given that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is the only word generating a ""yellow"" output other than ""zup,"" it's reasonable to assume that ""zup"" is generating the color yellow no matter what word it is adjacent to.

Considering these examples, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the position or surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.4922423396490588,131,zup
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can observe the following pattern:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""wif"" corresponds to either red or yellow depending on its position or surrounding words.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Looking at the outputs, when ""zup"" is present, it consistently corresponds to the color yellow. This pattern holds true in every instance where ""zup"" appears. Note that ""wif"" changes its output color when following ""zup,"" indicating that ""zup"" does not affect the output color of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.044435829708235,131,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup."" Let's examine the patterns together:

1. When ""dax"" precedes or follows ""zup,"" the output for ""dax"" is ""green"" and for ""zup,"" it is ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" stands alone or is followed by words that are not ""dax,"" the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
3. When ""zup"" is followed by multiple words, each word has a distinct color in the output.

Given the above observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems not to be related to the particular word that follows or precedes it since ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. 

It appears that ""zup"" is directly linked to the output ""yellow,"" where the presence of ""zup"" always results in the color ""yellow"" in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Additionally, the word ""zup"" does not seem to change meaning based on its position or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze the changes in the sequence of colors as it is affected by the words preceding it.

In all occurrences, the word ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input strings, and the outputs all end with the color ""green."" It is also notable that ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"" in the output, whether ""bluf"" is present or not. The position of ""green"" in the sequence depends upon the number of words that follow ""dax"" but precede ""bluf.""

With that in mind, let's explore the potential rule associated with ""bluf"":

1. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" which means that ""bluf"" generates an additional ""green"" following the ""green"" produced by ""dax.""
2. ""lug dax bluf"" outputs ""blue green green,"" and here ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" while ""dax"" translates to ""green."" The ""bluf"" adds another ""green,"" as before.
3. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" turns into ""green red green yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" produces ""red,"" and ""zup"" produces ""yellow."" The addition of ""bluf"" seems to generate another ""yellow,"" indicating that it is duplicating the color associated with the word ""zup"" since it precedes ""bluf.""
4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" converts into ""red green yellow red green green."" The first occurrence of ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and so is the last ""dax"" before ""bluf,"" indicating the repeated ""green"" may be associated specifically with the occurrence of the word ""dax"" before ""bluf.""
5. ""dax wif bluf"" resolves as ""green red red,"" where ""wif"" is followed by ""red."" As ""bluf"" is at the end after ""wif,"" it seems that it doubles the ""red"" color output rather than adding ""green"" as previously considered.

The observed pattern is as follows: ""bluf"" duplicates the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it. If that word is ""dax,"" the color is ""green,"" and if the word is ""wif"" or ""zup"" with their respective colors, then those are the colors that get duplicated.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> duplicates the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it.",-0.078025675187947,131,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" yields an output of ""green"" along with the color associated with each input word that precedes it in reverse order. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

The output for each input always ends with ""green"" from the word ""bluf,"" and all other colors are the outputs for the words that came before ""bluf,"" but in reverse order:

Example 2: ""lug dax bluf"" gives ""blue green green"" (reverse of outputs for ""lug"" and ""dax"" plus output for ""bluf"").

Example 3: ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" gives ""green red green yellow yellow"" (reverse of outputs for ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" plus output for ""bluf"").

And so on.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided:

1. In instances where ""dax"" occurs, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""lug"" is present, ""blue"" appears in the output.
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
4. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
5. The word ""bluf"" appears at the end of every input.

Given that the output colors match the order of the input words, and ""bluf"" always corresponds to two colors at the end of each output, we can infer the following:

- The nonce word ""bluf"" potentially refers to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Let's validate this hypothesis:

1. In ""dax bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" The output is ""green green,"" so ""bluf"" here could mean ""repeat the green.""

2. In ""lug dax bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" corresponding to ""green."" The output ends with ""green green,"" supporting our hypothesis that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color.""

3. The pattern continues in the other examples where every time ""bluf"" occurs, the color associated with the word before ""bluf"" is repeated.

Based on this analysis, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""",-0.7178919729477646,131,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently maps to ""green"" in the outputs. Additionally, ""dax"" also always seems to result in ""green."" Therefore, it seems there is a duplication of output for the input ""bluf."" Since ""dax"" is always followed by a ""green,"" when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""bluf"" may simply repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word. 

Other words also seem to have a consistent mapping:
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue,""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red,""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

Based on these mappings, ""bluf"" appears to echo the color output related to the directly preceding word. 

However, in the example where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" This does not follow the established duplication pattern, since the preceding word (""wif"") does not double its output. This inconsistency means the duplication rule might not fully capture what ""bluf"" means or there might be additional context-specific rules at play.

Considering this, a safe induction might be that ""bluf"" results in ""green"" when following ""dax"", but other interactions need further examples for clarity.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we can analyze how the outputs correlate with the inputs containing ""walm"". Here’s the breakdown of each input and its corresponding output:

- ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
- ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red""

From these examples, we can deduce the following occurrences of ""walm"":

1. After ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", ""walm"" translates to a repetition of ""red"" for each occurrence.
2. After ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" repeated for each occurrence (although there's just one direct example of this correlation).
3. After ""dax lug"", which translate respectively to ""green"" and ""blue"", ""walm"" translates to blue, possibly continuing the color pattern initiated by the words before it (in this case, ""lug"" -> ""blue"").

Other than a direct correlation in translation, there doesn’t seem to be enough consistent data to precisely define ""walm"" as correlating to a specific color or rule. However, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" might indicate the continuation or repetition of the pattern of colors preceding it. But, the evidence for this rule is weak because it is mostly based on the repetitive aspect of ""red"" when ""wif"" precedes ""walm"". ""Walm"" does not always translate into a repetition of the preceding color word as shown in the case of ""dax lug walm"".

Given the limited data and the inconsistent translation of ""walm"", we cannot confidently determine an absolute meaning or rule. We can only determine that ""walm"" seems to introduce a repetition when following ""wif"" and possibly adapts to the color pattern currently in place.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The meaning of ""walm"" is uncertain, but it may indicate a continuation or repetition of a color pattern based on the preceding words, especially visible with the word ""wif"" where it causes a repetition of ""red"".",-0.1044631862442857,131,walm

- ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
    - ""walm"" appears twice; first instance results in three reds, second in three yellows.
- ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
    - ""walm"" leads to three reds, followed by another word that results in green.
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
    - ""walm"" after ""dax lug"" leads to three blues.
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
    - ""walm"" appears after ""zup wif"" and results in three reds.
- ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red""
    - ""walm"" follows ""dax lug wif"" and leads to three reds.

To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to find a common rule that can explain the different outputs following its occurrence in various contexts. The rule appears to involve both the position of ""walm"" in the sequence and the words that precede it.

Here's what we can deduce:
- ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the output color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
- The number of times that color is repeated appears to consistently be three, regardless of the word.

Let's apply this rule to the examples:

- In the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" follows it, thus three reds. ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""walm,"" leading to three yellows.
- In the second input, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in three reds; ""dax"" leads to green.
- In the third input, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" follows, resulting in three blues.
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" follows it after ""zup,"" leading to three reds.
- In the final input, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" follows it, thus three reds after ""green blue.""

Rule:
walm -> a function that repeats the output color associated with the immediate precedent word three times.",-0.13648901215182135,131,walm
"Examining the examples:

1. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
2. wif walm dax -> red red red green
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red

To find what ""walm"" means, we should look at the input before and after the occurrence of ""walm"" and how that affects the corresponding colors in the output.

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""wif"" directly precedes ""walm"". Following ""wif"", the output is always ""red red red"". This suggests that ""wif"" correlates with ""red red red"", but doesn't inform us about ""walm"".
- In example 1, ""zup"" comes after the first ""walm"" and the output repeats ""yellow"" three times after ""wif walm"", suggesting ""zup"" correlates with one or more ""yellow"" outputs. The second ""walm"" in example 1 does not change the pattern of colors and continues with ""yellow"".
- In example 3, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue blue"". The ""walm"" that follows does not change the preceding color but extends it by one more ""blue"".
- Example 5 includes ""dax lug wif walm"" and the output is ""green blue red red red"", suggesting ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""wif"" with ""red"". The ""walm"" extends the ""red"" sequence by only one, regardless of what color comes before it.

Based on this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" extends the color pattern related to the previous word by one without introducing a new color. 

Rule: walm -> extends the previous color sequence by one.

Example validations:

1. Input: wif walm zup -> Output would be: red red red yellow (since ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" and ""walm"" extends it)
2. Input: dax walm -> Output would be: green green (since ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""walm"" extends it)",-0.2460071608316668,131,walm
"Using the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. After ""wif walm"" the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to triple ""red.""
2. After ""walm"" alone following ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the output is a single color repeated three times (e.g., ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"").
3. The word ""walm"" appears to cause a repetition of colors, but the number of times the color is repeated and the color itself depends on the preceding word.

We can summarize:

- ""wif"" leads to ""red red red""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the last color (""red"") is repeated three times, thus ""red"" becomes ""yellow"" (so for each ""wif"" preceding ""walm,"" substitute one ""red"" with three ""yellows"").
- When ""walm"" stands alone after ""dax,"" the next color is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" stands alone after ""lug,"" the next color is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" there's no direct output for ""zup,"" but the effect is the same as ""dax"" or ""lug"" with a repetition of the color three times.

Based on this, we can infer that ""walm"" triggers a triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word (if any). However, without explicit color outputs for ""zup"" and ""lug,"" we are extrapolating based on context. For ""dax,"" the associated color is green; for ""wif,"" it's yellow, following the substitution rule.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" replace the last ""red"" with three ""yellows"".",-0.7871085152904765,131,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the outputs according to the presence of the word ""walm"" in each input.

1. When ""wif walm"" is in the input, the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" So, ""walm"" could change the color from red to yellow, but there is an extra ""red"" before the ""yellows"" start, which means that ""wif"" alone must generate ""red red red"" without ""walm"" influencing it. So ""walm"" following ""wif"" seems to elongate the sequence of the color red before changing to a sequence of yellow.

2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""lug,"" such as in inputs ""dax lug walm"" and ""dax lug wif walm,"" the output starts with the respective colors for ""dax"" and ""lug"" followed by a sequence of reds. There is no presence of yellow. This suggests ""walm"" in these cases does not lead to yellow.

Considering these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" does not concern a fixed color but rather a repetition of the preceding color or a sequence pattern that is conditioned by the word that comes before it. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word that precedes it in the sequence, until a condition is met (like when it's after ""wif"" it switches to ""yellow"" after a couple of “red”).

Therefore, the rule could be framed as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence until another condition is met (in the case with ""wif"" that condition changes the color to yellow).",-0.8890673944071429,131,walm

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the output colors corresponding to the other words and their positions surrounding ""walm"" in the input sentences.

From this, we can see that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""walm"" doesn't have a consistent output color of its own; instead, it causes the color that follows it to repeat.

For instance:
- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" from ""zup"" to repeat twice more after it.
- In the second example, ""lug walm dax,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" from ""lug"" to repeat twice before ""dax.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat before shifting to ""wif"" (red).
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" ""walm"" causes the previous color ""red"" from ""wif"" to repeat before shifting to ""lug"" (blue) and then ""wif"" (red).
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" causes the ""green"" from ""dax"" to repeat once more.

- In the final example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green."" Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the association between the inputs and the outputs in each example:

- ""zup walm dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" The word ""walm"" must influence the repetition of ""yellow"" and possibly the presence of ""dax"" at the end of the chain leads to ""green.""
  
- ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red."" Here, ""walm"" appears twice and each occurrence leads to a triplet of the same color. ""Dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""
  
- ""dax lug walm"" gives ""green blue blue blue."" The presence of ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" while ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""blue.""
  
- ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and again, ""walm"" seems to induce the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.
  
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green."" This input sequence solidifies the idea that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat.

From the outputs following the word ""walm,"" a pattern emerges where the color repeats for as many words that follow ""walm."" When ""walm"" appears at the end of the input sequence, only one color repeats (like in the first example). When ""walm"" appears before other words, it seems to dictate that the next color repeats for the number of words that follow.

For example, in the second input, ""zup"" is the word right after ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is the output for ""zup,"" which repeats three times.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
- The word ""walm"" causes the output color for the word immediately following it to repeat for the number of words that remain in the input after ""walm.""

So the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> The word that follows ""walm"" will have its associated color output repeated for the number of remaining words in the input, including the word immediately after ""walm.""",-0.09024563060409577,134,walm

3. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

If we examine the outputs closely, we find that ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of colors in the output that are all the same and match the color output that relates to the word before ""walm"". For example:

- In 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is three green.
- In 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is three yellow.
- In 3, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and results in three yellow.
- In 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in three blue.
- In 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in two blue (the number of occurrences is one less because there's one fewer word after ""walm"").

It looks like ""walm"" might be a repeater or duplicator acting on the color produced by the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions appears to match the number of words that follow ""walm,"" not including ""walm"" itself.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's observe the patterns in each example.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" resulting in ""green green green red."" This suggests that ""walm"" may be related to the repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output contains a repetition of ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows a repeated usage of ""zup"" and precedes ""dax wif,"" with the output showing repeated ""yellow"" followed by ""green red,"" again indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.
4. The fourth example shows ""walm"" following ""lug"" and resulting in repeated ""blue"" colors in the output.
5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" without any other words after it, and the output is repeated ""blue,"" which again is the color associated with ""lug.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated an additional two times. Therefore, the output for a word sequence ending in ""word walm"" would be the output for ""word"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated two additional times, resulting in three repetitions of that color in total.",-0.9316083441208508,134,walm
"Rule: The term ""walm"" seems to represent the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Explanation:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green. After ""walm"" is used, ""green"" is repeated three times, which might be because ""walm"" is immediately following ""dax"". However, ""wif"" follows ""walm"", turning the output to red. Therefore, ""walm"" might mean repeat the previous color until a new color word appears.

2. In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", we see ""yellow"" repeated three times, again until a new color word (""dax"") appears and changes the color to green.

3. In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with yellow. Consequently, ""yellow"" is repeated four times until a new color word (""dax"") appears to switch the color to green.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" is associated with blue, which is repeated twice following ""walm"" until ""zup"" appears and changes the output to yellow.

5. In the last example, ""lug"" again precedes ""walm"", thus the output is ""blue"" repeated three times with no subsequent color word to change the pattern.

- Every occurrence of the word ""dax"" results in the word ""green"".
- Every occurrence of the word ""wif"" results in the word ""red"".

Now, looking at the outputs when 'zup' is involved:

- ""lug walm zup walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, lug -> blue, walm -> blue (because zup follows), zup -> ?, walm -> yellow (no blue because it is not followed by zup).
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, zup -> ?, walm -> yellow (because it does not follow zup)
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" leads to ""green yellow blue red blue"". Here, dax -> green, zup -> ?, lug -> blue, wif -> red, lug -> blue.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" leads to ""green green green red red red yellow"".

- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"". Here, zup -> yellow.

Therefore, the examples indicate that 'zup' results in the output ""yellow"" when it occurs. However, 'zup' also appears to affect the output color of ""walm"" when it follows ""walm,"" changing it from the default ""green"" to ""blue.""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output, and when ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" it changes the output color of ""walm"" to ""blue"". If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" its corresponding output is also changed to ""yellow"".

Therefore:

- The input 'zup walm' results in 'yellow' three times, corresponding to 'zup', followed by a single 'yellow', which corresponds to 'walm'.
- When 'dax zup lug wif lug' is given, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'. Between 'dax' and 'lug', 'zup' inserts three 'yellow' without affecting the correlation of 'lug' and 'blue'.
- In 'dax walm wif walm zup', 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'. After the last 'walm', which is 'yellow', 'zup' follows, and it corresponds to three 'yellow'.

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - Following ""bluf"", ""zup"" is repeated and ""red"" appears again in the output.

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - Following ""bluf"", ""lug"" comes next and ""red"" turns into ""blue"" in the output.

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - Following ""bluf"", there is no additional word, so the color doesn't change from the one corresponding to ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug

   - ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green""

   - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - Following ""bluf"", there is no additional word, so the color doesn't change from the one corresponding to ""dax"", which is ""green"".

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" signifies a rule where the color associated with the word following it is to be repeated unless ""bluf"" is the last word, in which case the output repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> Replicate the color associated with the word that follows ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the last word, replicate the color of the word before ""bluf"".",-0.08188637505950648,136,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to examine the consistent relationships between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's compare each input with its output to find a pattern.

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow
3. Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
4. Input: lug bluf dax lug | Output: blue blue green blue
5. Input: dax bluf | Output: green green

Now looking at the patterns, the nonce word ""bluf"" always translates to the same color as the word preceding it:

1. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
2. ""bluf lug"" corresponds to ""red blue"" (""bluf"" gives ""red"" as ""wif"" was before it)
3. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" 
4. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
5. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""

So it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it, or more specifically, it repeats the color that is assigned to the previous word.

Rule: `bluf` -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.11088084238455845,136,bluf

Input: wif bluf lug zup

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first look at the pattern of colors generated by each input.

Observations: 

1. When ""lug"" is in the input, the output contains ""blue"". Whenever ""lug"" appears alone with ""walm"", we get an output of three ""blue""s.
2. With ""dax"" present, the output contains ""green"".
3. With ""wif"" present, the output contains ""red"".
4. With ""zup"" present, the output contains ""yellow"".

Now, let's analyze:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""walm"" may translate to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word.
- ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue"", further supporting that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". This implies that ""lug walm"" means three ""blue""s, confirming the pattern that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word just before it to be repeated three times.
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"", and here ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in three ""yellow""s, consistent with the previous findings.
- Repeating ""lug walm"" gives the same result as before, thus consistently showing that ""walm"" means repetition.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated three times. 

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.1674320977073855,136,walm
"From the examples provided, we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated output of the color linked to the word that immediately precedes it. Let's analyze the patterns associated with the words:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" indicates that ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") and repeats it three times.

2. ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue"" shows that ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times before we see the color associated with ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

3. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green"" implies that following ""lug"" (blue), the color ""blue"" is repeated three times due to ""walm,"" and ""walm"" does not affect the colors designated for ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green).

4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" follows the second ""zup"" and causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times, not affecting the other color associations.

From this, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it results in the color associated with that word being repeated three times.

Walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.22597209627318074,136,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears as follows:

walm -> meaning: repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule:

- ""dax walm lug"" includes ""green (for dax), followed by walm,"" which repeats the color of ""dax"" three times, then ""blue"" for ""lug"".
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" has ""yellow (for zup) blue (for lug), followed by walm,"" which repeats the color of ""lug"" three times, then ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""green"" for ""dax"".
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" has ""red yellow blue green yellow, followed by walm,"" which repeats the color of ""zup"" three times.
Since ""walm"" always causes the color of the word before it to be repeated three times, the general rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is established.",-0.4702516322014459,136,walm
"Observing the pattern of the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules:

1. ""lug"" translates to a single ""blue.""
2. ""dax"" translates to a single ""green.""
3. ""wif"" translates to a single ""red.""
4. ""zup"" translates to a single ""yellow.""
5. When ""walm"" is appended after a word, it repeats the color of the word preceding it twice more.

Now, let's apply these rules:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") and repeats it two more times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm lug"" outputs ""green green green blue,"" which means ""walm"" here takes the color of ""dax"" (which is ""green"") and repeats it two more times, and then ""lug"" adds a ""blue"" at the end.
- This pattern follows for all subsequent examples provided.

- ""lug zup dax walm"" produces ""blue yellow green green green"", with ""blue yellow"" corresponding to ""lug zup"" and ""green green green"" corresponding to ""dax walm"" (following the syllable count).

When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" which seemingly has one syllable, the output deviates from the previous pattern and results in ""green red"", which is different than the previous rule expectations.

Given this inconsistency and the limited data set, the precise meaning of ""dax"" is difficult to determine. But a probable partial rule could be:

dax -> meaning. Meaning is based on the context within the sentence, generating ""green""s according to the number of syllables in the word that follows it, unless the word is ""wif"" which generates a ""red"". However, this rule is inconsistent and cannot be confirmed without more examples or additional context.

Rule: ""dax"" generates a sequence of ""green""s matching the number of syllables in the word that immediately follows it, unless followed by ""wif"", which generates ""red"". If ""dax"" appears without a following word, it generates a single ""green"". If ""dax"" itself is preceded by more than one word, each word is translated into its separate color code before generating the ""green"" sequence for ""dax"".",-0.3418132832730158,137,dax

Taking every example as part of the data set, the relationship between ""zup"" and ""yellow"" remains consistent. This suggests that ""zup"" directly corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs, as it is the only common factor in each situation where ""yellow"" is produced.

- The same pattern is observed with other words:

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we examine the relationship between the input sequences and their respective output colors. 

In the input-output pairs provided, we notice the following patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" appears right after ""wif,"" the color after ""red"" is always ""red.""
2. When ""bluf"" is surrounded by the same word (e.g., ""zup bluf zup"" or ""wif bluf wif""), the color after the first color is again the same as the first (e.g., ""yellow red red"" for ""zup wif bluf zup"").
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by different words, its color appears to be an amalgamation or a combination of the two colors from the surrounding words (e.g., ""blue red"" for ""lug wif bluf"").
4. When ""bluf"" appears at the end of the sequence with no preceding word, it repeats the color of the word before it (e.g., ""yellow yellow"" for ""zup bluf"").

"Based on the patterns evident in the provided input-output pairs, it is possible to deduce a rule for what the nonce word ""walm"" means within the context of these examples.

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"" in the given examples:

1. The sequence ""zup lug zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" results in repeating the color immediately before it, ""yellow"" in this case.

2. The sequence ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" showing that ""walm"" again repeats the color immediately before it, ""red"" this time.

3. The sequence ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green,"" which is consistent with the rule that ""walm"" repeats ""yellow,"" the color that appears just before it.

4. The sequence ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" again ""walm"" repeats the immediate preceding color, ""blue"" in this case.

5. Finally, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" maintaining the pattern of ""walm"" repeating the color directly before it, ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by finding a pattern in how the words translate into colors in the output.

In each case, the occurrence of ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word:

1. In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated until a new color is introduced (dax -> green).

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to have an association with the color red. However, upon closer inspection of the context in which ""walm"" appears, we can observe a pattern that determines the color it translates to.

Examining each instance, ""walm"" follows a word that is translated into a color, and the output is the repetition of the color that precedes ""walm"".

For example:
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which translates to ""green"", the output is ""green green"".

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" doubles the color mentioned before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color.",-1.2601502310952382,137,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the input with the output in each given example. We will look for patterns within each transformation from the input strings to the output strings of colors.

In the first example, we see that ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green."" However, the word ""walm"" always precedes a sequence of ""yellow"" outcomes except when it is at the end of an input sequence.

Analyzing the other examples for consistency with this finding:

- In the second example, after ""walm"" we see two ""red,"" which correspond to ""wif"" and a ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of two ""yellow"" which correspond to ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is again followed by a ""blue,"" which in this output is associated with ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, just like in the first and third examples, ""walm"" is again followed by a sequence of ""red,"" corresponding to ""wif.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color following it to repeat unless it is at the end of an input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as:

Rule: ""walm"" means repeat the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input, it will be translated into the color that corresponds to ""walm"" itself, which, based on the outputs, is ""yellow.""

"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to the word ""red"" in the output.

Thus, ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue"". However, when it directly follows ""dax"", it also affects the following words, making them ""green"". Since the prompt asks to deduce what ""lug"" means and not the behavior of ""dax"", the inducible rule is:

4. Input: ""dax lug dax lug wif"" → Output: ""green blue green blue red""
5. Input: ""wif dax wif"" → Output: ""red green red""

Firstly, let's note that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green"" in the output. This correspondence appears consistent across all examples, regardless of the words that come before or after ""dax.""

Now, let's break down the rule induction:

- ""zup"" in the first input leads to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""wif"" appears in the second, fourth, and fifth inputs, and it consistently leads to ""red"" in the outputs.
- ""lug"" in the fourth input leads to ""blue"" in the output each time it appears.

From this, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently. Other words also correspond to specific colors:

- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""walm"" -> Since ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" and we know ""dax"" means ""green,"" ""walm"" can be assumed to mean ""green"" as well.

- In Example 1, the sequence of ""lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue red red red blue"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" corresponds to red. The word ""walm"" seems to lead to an extra ""red"" before the final ""lug"", which is blue.
- Example 2 shows that after ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, the ""walm dax"" sequence results in ""yellow yellow green"". It's worth noting that ""dax"" alone corresponds to green, while ""walm"" before ""dax"" adds more yellow than would typically follow from ""zup"" alone.
- Example 3 shows the ""dax walm wif dax"" sequence results in ""green green green red green"". This suggests that ""walm"" placed between ""dax"" and ""wif"" produced an additional ""green"".
- Example 4 shows that ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green"", suggesting that ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to two more greens.
- Example 5 shows that ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", with ""walm"" after ""zup"" leading to two additional yellows.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" two more times before moving to the next color. Therefore:

walm -> The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that when it follows a color word (such as ""lug"", ""dax"", or ""zup""), it doubles the preceeding color before adding the next one.",-0.0809370120120115,138,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's review each instance of ""walm"" in the given examples and identify patterns in the outputs:

1. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Blue blue red blue red (walm) red blue
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""red.""

2. zup walm dax
   Yellow yellow yellow (walm) green
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""green.""

3. dax walm wif dax
   Green green green (walm) red green
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""red.""

4. lug dax walm
   Blue green green (walm) green
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""green.""

5. zup walm
   Yellow yellow yellow (walm)
   No color follows ""walm,"" so this case provides less information.

A clear pattern emerges: ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to repeat the one immediately preceding it. Therefore, ""walm"" functions as an instruction to repeat the last color mentioned before ""walm.""

Rule:
walm -> meaning. Repeat the last mentioned color.",-0.2257980404037931,138,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the output of each input with respect to occurrences of ""walm.""

In the first example, the sequence 'lug wif walm lug' translates to 'blue red red red blue'. Here ""walm"" precedes a sequence of ""red"" followed by ""blue"", which is the color associated with ""lug"".

In the second example, 'zup walm dax' translates to 'yellow yellow yellow green'. Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") and precedes ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"").

In the third example, 'dax walm wif dax' translates to 'green green green red green.' Here ""walm"" is surrounded by ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") and precedes ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"").

In the fourth example, 'lug dax walm' translates to 'blue green green green'. This suggests that ""walm"" follows a sequence of colors beginning with ""blue"" and ""green.""

In the fifth example, 'zup walm' translates to 'yellow yellow yellow'. The output is a repetition of ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to cause the color of the previous word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.5018114199452876,138,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" affects the output in a specific way related to the word that precedes it. Here is the rule I have induced:

When ""walm"" follows another word, the output color associated with that preceding word is repeated three times.

Applying this rule to the examples:

- In example 1, ""lug wif walm lug,"" ""wif"" is red, and after ""walm,"" we see ""red red red"" before returning to ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In example 2, ""zup walm dax,"" ""zup"" is yellow, and after ""walm,"" we have ""yellow yellow yellow"" before changing to ""dax,"" which is green.
- In example 3, ""dax walm wif dax,"" ""dax"" is green, so after ""walm,"" we observe ""green green green"" before changing to ""wif,"" which is red.
- In example 4, ""lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm,"" we see ""green green green.""
- In example 5, ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is yellow, and after ""walm,"" we have ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> When following a word, it causes the output color of that word to be repeated three times.",-0.6742369013275863,138,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the color ""red"" appears an equivalent number of times in the output.
2. Following ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""yellow.""
3. After ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" leads to additional repetitions of ""green"" in the output.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it—it does not introduce a new color but instead duplicates the last color mentioned.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the preceding color.",-1.3260596798672415,138,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output colors are directly related to the input words. Each instance of ""lug"" always results in ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Additionally, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""zup"" and ""bluf"" appear to be associated with changes to the sequence of colors rather than a one-to-one correspondence to a specific color.

Given these observations, it is possible to deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue

This implies that whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it directly translates to the color blue in the output.",-1.1693051306211761,139,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the term ""lug"" has a consistent result when it is used in the input. It corresponds to a particular color in the output, regardless of its position among other words in the input sentence. Here is the analysis:

- In the first input, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue while for ""dax"" is green.
- In the second input, ""lug"" is the first word and all outputs are blue, which may indicate that ""lug"" outputs blue irrespective of its position.
- In the third input, ""lug"" produces red when preceded by ""wif walm,"" but ""lug"" on its own or with different preceding words did not produce red. However, in this case, the individual word ""lug"" still corresponds to blue right after it.
- In the fourth input, ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue while for ""wif"" is red.
- In the fifth input, ""lug"" is the first word followed by ""dax,"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue again.

Given all examples, it seems that ""lug"" reliably maps to the color blue in the output regardless of the other words present or their positions. Other words map to different colors, and are not as consistent as ""lug"" in terms of color mapping, indicating the meaning of ""lug"" is quite specific and not influenced by adjacent words.

"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples provided and determine the correlation between the usage of ""walm"" and the resulting outputs.

Examining the outputs, it's clear that ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color immediately before it, for a total of three repetitions in the output sequence.

Let's verify this with the examples:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and in the output, ""red"" is repeated three times after the first instance.

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
   Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" again and corresponds to ""red,"" which is also repeated three times.

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   
   In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated three times.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   
   ""Walm"" follows a ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and we see that ""red"" is repeated three times after its first occurrence.

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output shows ""green"" repeated three times, confirming the rule observed.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> means to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.",-0.06776313380774547,139,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should analyze the relationship between the input and the outputs in the given examples.

Analyzing the first example:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" is at the end of the input and there are three ""red"" at the end of the output, and ""wif"" also produces ""red,"" we might infer ""walm"" extends the preceding color, in this case, ""red.""

Let's apply this potential rule to the next example:
Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Here, the term ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again, and we see ""red"" repeated three times, which aligns with our initial hypothesis that ""walm"" could mean a repetition of the previous color.

Now let's check the third example:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

The term ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" here, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""Blue"" is repeated three times after ""walm"" and before the next word, ""zup,"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

The fourth example:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and we see an extension with three additional ""red"" before the color changes to ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Finally, the fifth example:
Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and there is an extension of ""green"" twice more before the next color ""red"" for ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce a rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it repeats the output color of the preceding word three times. 

So, walm -> meaning. Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the previously stated color three more times.",-0.07025169993360915,139,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" affects the words that precede it by changing their corresponding outputs to a repeating pattern of the immediate preceding word's output. In other words, ""walm"" seems to cause the output color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" to be repeated for the number of words between ""walm"" and the next non-repeating color word (either ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug"").

Let's analyze the examples given:

1. dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   - ""green red yellow yellow red"" becomes ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" 
   - ""walm"" changes the output following ""wif"" to be ""red"" repeatedly.

2. dax wif walm
   - ""green red"" becomes ""green red red red""
   - ""walm"" changes the output following ""wif"" to be ""red"" repeatedly.

3. zup dax lug walm zup
   - ""yellow green blue"" becomes ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" 
   - ""walm"" changes the output following ""lug"" to be ""blue"" repeatedly until a new color word ""zup"" appears.

4. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   - ""red red green green red"" becomes ""red red green green red red red blue red"" 
   - ""walm"" changes the output following ""wif"" to be ""red"" repeatedly until ""lug"" changes the pattern.

5. dax walm wif bluf
   - ""green"" becomes ""green green green red red""
   - ""walm"" changes the output following ""dax"" to be ""green"" repeatedly until ""wif"" occurs and changes the pattern.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" will cause the output color of the word immediately prior to it to be repeated for as long as there are words until a new color word appears, causing a change in output color.

Rule: walm -> Causes the output color of the preceding word to repeat until a new color word is encountered.",-0.08093548241852727,139,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must compare the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. By examining the repetition of certain words and their outputs, it's possible to isolate the effect of ""walm.""

Looking at the provided examples, we can identify certain patterns for words other than ""walm"" first:

1. ""dax"" always corresponds to the output color ""green.""
2. ""wif"" always corresponds to the output color ""red.""
3. ""bluf"" always corresponds to the output color ""red"" when following ""wif"" and ""green"" when standalone or following other words.
4. ""zup"" corresponds to the output color ""yellow.""
5. ""lug"" corresponds to the output color ""blue.""

Now let's focus on ""walm"" and its pattern:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or ""dax,"" the output is ""red red red"" regardless of what ""wif"" or ""dax"" ordinarily produces:
   - ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax wif walm"" -> green red red red
   - ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> green green green red red

2. When ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the output again is ""green green green"":
   - ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> green green green red red (Note: we see the color ""green"" three times in the output, which corresponds to the occurrences of ""dax"" and ""walm."")

Based on these observations, we can discern that ""walm"" acts as a significant modifier that changes the output sequence. Following ""dax"" or ""wif,"" it triggers a repetition of three colors that reflect the color immediately preceding ""walm."" 

After ""dax,"" it results in ""green green green,"" and after ""wif,"" it leads to ""red red red."" 

The rule is not valid when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup,"" as shown in the third and fourth examples.

Taking into account its modifying nature and the patterns observed, we can deduce:

walm -> triggers a repetition of three colors corresponding to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it (when that word is ""dax"" or ""wif""). When following ""dax,"" it repeats the color ""green"" three times. When following ""wif,"" it repeats the color ""red"" three times.

"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word"".

Supporting Observations:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is translated to ""red"". The output for ""walm"" is ""red red red"". This suggests that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color related to ""wif"", i.e., ""red"".
   
2. In the second example, ""walm"" also follows ""wif"" and the color ""red"" is again repeated three times after ""walm"".

3. The third example has ""walm"" following ""lug"" and ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"". Consequently, ""walm"" yields ""blue blue blue"", signaling a repeat of the preceding color.

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""lug"". After ""walm"", the sequence is ""red red red blue"", where ""red"" is the color of ""wif"" and is repeated, followed by ""blue"", which is the color of the subsequent word ""lug"".

5. The fifth example showcases ""walm"" following ""dax"" which is associated with ""green"". After ""walm"", we see ""green green"" confirming the pattern that ""walm"" causes repetition of the prior color, in this case, ""green"".

This pattern holds true for each instance of ""walm"" and leads to the rule mentioned above.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color output, regardless of the other words' presence. This can be deduced from the fact that every input instance containing ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"" being part of the output sequence.

Firstly, when ""dax"" is present with other words such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif,"" the output always includes the color ""green"" at the position where ""dax"" was inputted.

Secondly, when ""dax"" is the only input, the output is solely ""green,"" which indicates the direct mapping of ""dax"" to ""green,"" regardless of the context or surrounding words.

"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we can analyze the input-output pairs and look for patterns. Let's examine each pairing:

1. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   - Here, ""wif"" occurs at the beginning and before ""zup."" In both cases, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - In this example, ""wif"" occurs after ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" and each occurrence of ""wif"" results in ""red."" It's also followed by other colors without a clear positional correlation.

3. Input: lug zup wif
   Output: blue yellow red
   - ""Wif"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - Here, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and then ""lug""—and both times, it translates to ""red."" 

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""Wif"" follows ""dax"" again and results in ""red.""

Based on these examples, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. However, there is a common element in all cases: ""wif"" is never at the beginning of an input. Yet, when it is used, no matter the preceding or following words, the output is consistently ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",-0.057145935877379636,140,wif
"Examining the relationship between the input and output sequences with the occurrences of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can attempt to induce a rule about its meaning. Here are the comparisons with the focus on ""wif"":

1. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
3. lug zup wif -> blue yellow red
4. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Observing the pattern, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" It does not seem to depend on context or position in the sequence. All other words in the input correspond to a different color without repetition.

Rule: wif -> red",-0.08242467151409257,140,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", let us look for patterns in the input and output sequences provided in the examples.

- In the first example, we see that ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow."" Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" It is also noted that ""wif"" appears at the beginning and end of the sequence, correlating to ""red"" appearing at the beginning and end of the output.

- In the second example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" is ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" We notice that ""wif"" is again translating to ""red"" and is flanked by the same color ""yellow,"" which is associated with ""zup."" Also, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" may mean ""red"" and ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the previous color.

- The third example, ""lug zup wif,"" becomes ""blue yellow red."" Once again, we see that ""wif"" aligns with ""red"" at the end of the sequence.

- The fourth example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" shows ""wif"" both in the middle and at the end, corresponding with ""red"" at the same positions. It also confirms that ""lug"" is ""blue.""

- The fifth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" becomes ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" We notice that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, and ""bluf"" seems to be ""red"" here as well.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red

The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",-0.21648686820335186,140,wif
"Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" seems to represent the color ""red."" 

This rule is deduced from the repetitive presence of the word ""wif"" and the corresponding output of ""red"" in every instance in the given examples. Here is how the rule applies to the examples:

- In the first example (Input: wif lug bluf wif zup), ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" after which ""red blue"" appears in the output, and ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" after which ""red yellow"" appears in the output.
- In the second example (Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm), ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and ""red"" follows ""green,"" and later, ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" with ""red red red"" in the output.
- In the third example (Input: lug zup wif), ""wif"" is the last word and is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth example (Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif), ""wif"" occurs twice, and each time it is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth example (Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf), ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" which is consistent with the earlier examples.

Therefore:

wif -> red",-0.5621543675663795,140,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" represents the color ""red."" Here is the reasoning:

- In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding location in the output.
- Other words in the inputs, such as ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax,"" seem to correspond to the colors ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""red,"" respectively, although with different reproducibility. It's possible that some of these other words result in sequences of color outputs or are dependent on context, but the instances of ""wif"" consistently relate to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",-1.2260226013467599,140,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" based on the given examples, let's first write down each input next to its corresponding output and then analyze the sequences:

- Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
- Input: lug walm zup -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
- Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug -> Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

In the examples where ""zup"" appears, the output always includes ""yellow"" at the position matching where ""zup"" is placed in the input. 

For instance:
- When ""zup"" is the first word in the input, ""yellow"" is the first word in the output (inputs 1 and 3).
- When ""zup"" is the last word in the input, ""yellow"" is the last word in the output (input 2).
- When ""zup"" is in between other words, ""yellow"" is correspondingly in between the same words in the output (input 4).
- When multiple words appear before and after ""zup"" in the input, ""yellow"" appears at the same position in the output (input 5).

Other words in the examples (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") appear to be consistently translated to their outputs (""red,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow""), regardless of their position in the sequence. However, ""zup"" also outputs ""yellow,"" thus not providing a distinct translation like the other words.

The pattern suggests that ""zup"" does not change meaning based on context or position but maintains a constant output. Based on these observations, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: zup translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",-0.10631591877667092,140,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Below are the examples with ""zup"" replaced by ""yellow"" for clarity:

Input: yellow wif
Output: yellow red

Input: lug walm yellow
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: yellow walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Input: wif yellow
Output: red yellow

Input: wif lug yellow walm wif lug

It is consistent across all the examples that the appearance of ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" appearing in the output. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> ""yellow""",-0.24804373590231646,140,zup

zup -> ""yellow""",-1.5667500807455694,140,zup
"Analyzing the given examples where the nonce word ""zup"" is used, it seems that the word ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" each time it's used. The rule seems consistent, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.668493600912658,140,zup
"Examining the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce what the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to in terms of colors.

Let's consider each example and the color patterns.

1. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   First two words correspond to two different colours.

2. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   First three words correspond to three different colours, but ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word.

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   Again, we see ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word just before it, ""zup"" in this case, which is yellow.

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   Similar to the previous examples, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"" which corresponds to red.

5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
   Again, ""bluf"" repeats the previous color for both of its occurrences.

Based on the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence.",-0.06928320961426317,140,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in its placement and the corresponding output colors.

From the examples, it seems ""bluf"" almost always corresponds to an output of ""red."" However, in every instance, ""bluf"" has a word before it and produces an extra ""red"" in the output. It implies ""bluf"" may have a rule tied not only to its own appearance but also to the presence of a preceding word.

Let's look at each case:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
   There's an extra green after red. ""dax"" corresponds to this green.

2. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
   The ""red red"" in the output corresponds to ""wif bluf,"" and there's an extra ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug.""

3. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" producing an extra ""red."" Before ""bluf,"" there is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
   Here again, ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" producing an extra ""red.""

5. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
   ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""zup,"" repeating the pattern for both.

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" outputting ""red"" might be a base rule. Additionally, ""bluf"" appears to cause the word immediately before it to repeat its corresponding color output. This can be hypothesized as a doubling effect caused by ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and replicates the output color of the word immediately preceding it.",-0.08035192028829476,140,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the color patterns in the outputs whenever ""bluf"" appears:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
2. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
3. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
4. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
5. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green

Observing the above, the color that appears immediately after ""bluf"" is consistently ""red."" Thus, it seems that no matter the input, the presence of ""bluf"" guarantees a ""red"" in the output sequence. No other consistent pattern is immediately discernible for ""bluf,"" due to varying inputs and outputs.

Based on the available data, the simplest rule we can infer is:

Rule: bluf -> red

This indicates that the nonce word ""bluf"" is represented by the color ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input or the surrounding words.",-0.09985201504241058,140,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""bluf,"" let's look at the contexts in which it appears:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" it results in ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" it results in ""green green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" it results in ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" it results in ""yellow yellow"".

We can notice that the word following ""bluf"" does not matter as ""bluf"" always outputs double the color code of the word before it. Therefore, irrespective of what word follows ""bluf,"" the rule for ""bluf"" is that it duplicates the color output of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color output of the preceding word.",-1.3302546332547371,140,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" the best approach is to look for patterns in the examples provided, focusing on the position of ""bluf"" and the words around it, as well as the color outputs that correlate with each input.

1. In every example where ""bluf"" is used, the output is ""green"" followed by the color ""red""—one ""red"" for each occurrence of the word ""bluf.""
2. The word prior to ""bluf"" does not seem to influence the color ""green"" since ""green"" appears whether the preceding word is ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug.""
3. When ""bluf"" appears twice in succession, as in example 5, the output is two sets of ""green"" followed by ""red.""
4. ""bluf"" does not correlate with a specific single color but rather a sequence of colors, specifically ""green"" followed by ""red.""

Considering these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that when the word ""bluf"" appears in an input, it corresponds to the sequence of colors ""green"" followed by ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> green red",-1.4803367582431577,140,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule associated with ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern in the outputs relative to their inputs.

1. In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it (e.g., ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" there are three repetitions of yellow). The word ""wif"" following ""walm"" is red.

    Input: zup walm wif
    Output: yellow yellow yellow red

2. In the second example, the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads again to a repetition of the color associated with ""lug"" (blue repeated three times).

    Input: lug walm
    Output: blue blue blue

3. The third example also follows the pattern of repetition where ""dax"" is associated with green, and after ""walm,"" the repetition stops, and the last color reflects ""lug,"" which is blue.

    Input: dax walm lug
    Output: green green green blue

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows two instances of ""zup"" and results in a repeat of the yellow color associated with ""zup,"" but the repetition now is four times, which might suggest that it repeats the previous color ""plus one additional time"" when two instances precede it. The word ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" to red. The sequence breaks after ""walm"" as usual.

    Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
    Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, and it repeats the blue color twice more as if ""lug"" has a default once prior occurrence before ""walm"". 
    
    Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
    Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. However, if the same word precedes it twice, an additional repetition is added (making it four), while if ""lug"" precedes it but only once in the sequence, it is treated as if ""lug"" appeared twice.

Rule: 
walm -> Causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times. If the preceding word is the same and appears twice in a row, add an extra repetition (four times total). If ""lug"" precedes it but only appears once in the sequence before ""walm,"" it is treated as if ""lug"" appeared twice (three repetitions in total).",-0.06675979243869565,140,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe when and how it changes the output. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

3. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Looking at these examples, let’s note the changes in outputs based on the presence of ""walm"" and the words that come before it.

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is repeated thrice before changing (“yellow yellow yellow”).
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.”
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""

This suggests ""walm"" involves repetition of the previous color in the output sequence. Moreover, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" causes the next mentioned 'color' word to be ignored, as seen in the fourth example where ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red) after ""walm"" seem to be replaced by ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup.""

Rule: The word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, three times for the output. If there is a color word following ""walm"" before another word, then that color is ignored.",-0.06982747101919565,140,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples given and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
   Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
   
2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   
3. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   
   Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" again translates to ""blue.""

4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   
   In this sequence, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf,"" which follows ""wif,"" is also red.

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   
   Again, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Based on the repeated patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color word immediately preceding it. For instance, in example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and translates to a repetition of ""yellow."" In example 3, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green."" In the absence of a color word right before ""walm,"" such as in example 2, ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color word that directly precedes it, extending the sequence of that color. If ""walm"" is the first word or no color word directly precedes ""walm,"" it repeats the last mentioned color in the sequence.",-0.08497369742527171,140,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the given examples and their outputs. We need to determine the rule that connects the input (which includes the word ""walm"") to the output (a series of color words).

Analyzing the input and output:

1. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
3. ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue""
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
5. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""

From the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word that corresponds to the word directly before it. The number of repetitions is three. Thus, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times. When it follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times, and following ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

Given this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is a function that repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.08563032314499998,140,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the relationship between the input and the output in each example. 

1. ""zup walm wif"" => ""yellow yellow yellow red""
2. ""lug walm"" => ""blue blue blue""
3. ""dax walm lug"" => ""green green green blue""
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" => ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
5. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" => ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""

Here are some observations:
- When ""walm"" follows a single color word ('zup', 'lug', or 'dax'), the color associated with that word is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows a sequence of different color words, 'zup' seems to dominate, as seen in Example 4.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by a sequence of the same color words, it seems to repeat that color, with the exception of the dominated case.

Thus, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that precedes it unless that color is preceded itself by another color. The repetition count is three unless it follows two different colors, in which case 'zup' dominates and is repeated four times before resuming the sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" one must find consistent patterns within the given examples. By examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, a rule for what ""zup"" translates to can be inferred.

1. Input: zup lug wif | Output: yellow blue red
2. Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
3. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax | Output: red red yellow red blue green
4. Input: dax zup dax walm | Output: green yellow green green green
5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm | Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

First, notice where ""zup"" appears and what color it corresponds with in the output:

1. zup appears first and corresponds to yellow.
2. zup is between dax and bluf and corresponds to yellow.
3. zup appears in the third position and corresponds to yellow.
4. zup is second and fourth in the pattern and both correspond to yellow.
5. zup third appearance corresponds to yellow.

The consistency of ""zup"" aligning with ""yellow"" in the outputs suggests the rule that no matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence, the output color is always ""yellow.""

In the third example, ""zup"" appears in the third position and again corresponds to ""yellow"". Other words in the sequence correspond to other colors based on additional instances, but ""zup"" remains ""yellow"".

In the fourth example, ""zup"" is used between the word ""dax"" which is translated both times as ""green"". Here, ""zup"" continues to be associated with the color ""yellow"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's first look at each instance where the word ""bluf"" appears in the input and the corresponding output.

1. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""
2. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
3. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
5. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""

Now, let's analyze:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif dax wif"" and the corresponding output ends with ""red red."" Since ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" it seems that ""bluf"" is also resulting in a ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is resulting in ""blue"" when following ""lug.""

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax,"" and the outputs are ""red green green."" Again, since ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""wif"" results in ""red,"" it seems ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" here, likely because it follows ""dax.""

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif walm,"" and the output sequence includes ""yellow yellow red red red."" We know ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" while ""walm"" also leads to ""red."" So in this context, ""bluf"" seems to result in ""yellow.""

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""lug,"" and just like in the second example, the output ends with ""blue blue,"" consistent with the idea that ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" when following ""lug.""

Based on these observations, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the previous word:

- When immediately following ""wif dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When immediately following ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- Otherwise, ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color of the word that precedes it.

However, we don't have a case where ""bluf"" is the first word or follows ""zup"" or ""walm"" directly, so there might be additional rules or contexts where ""bluf"" diverges from these patterns.

Rule: bluf -> It appears to take on the color of the preceding word unless it follows specific combinations like ""wif dax"" (where it is ""green"") or ""lug"" (where it is ""blue"").",-0.08325568146144581,142,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we examine the outputs corresponding to each time ""bluf"" appears in an input. In each case, we see what color is generated in the output at the position corresponding to ""bluf.""

- In the first input, ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" and the color for ""wif"" appears to be red. The output corresponding to ""bluf"" in this case is ""red.""
- In the second input, ""lug bluf,"" there is no word before ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" is the only other word. Given that ""lug"" appears twice in the output as ""blue blue,"" it seems logical that ""bluf"" must also refer to ""blue"" in this instance as the word ""bluf"" follows ""lug.""
- In the third input, ""wif dax bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which appears to output ""green."" However, ""bluf"" results in ""green"" being in the output, which is the same output as for ""dax.""
- The fourth input, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" has ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" whereas ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and ""walm"" comes last. The output corresponding to ""bluf"" in this case is yellow, which is the same color as ""zup.""
- The fifth input, ""wif walm lug bluf,"" results in ""red red red blue blue."" Here ""walm"" and ""lug"" repeat as ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, and again ""bluf"" is following ""lug"" and results in ""blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes the color of the last word/color mentioned before it. Hence, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. If no word precedes it, it defaults to blue. This is evident from the second example where ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" defaulting to blue due to the absence of another color preceding it.

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
4. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
5. Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red

We should look for patterns before and after ""walm"" to infer its meaning.

Observations:
- ""walm"" follows the word ""dax"" in every instance.
- The output color for ""walm"" is always green, regardless of its position or the words that follow it.
- The word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green in the output.
- When ""walm"" appears, there is an additional green in the output sequence apart from the green corresponding to ""dax."" This suggests ""walm"" might be related to repeating or duplicating the green color prompted by ""dax.""

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the previous color or adds an additional instance of the last color mentioned in the pattern.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color",-0.1438542491517778,142,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's look at the patterns involving ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm"" in each input and their corresponding outputs.

- When ""dax"" is present, it seems to be associated with the color ""green.""
- When ""wif"" is present, it seems to be associated with the color ""red.""
- When ""zup"" is present, it seems to be associated with the color ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is present, it seems to be associated with the color ""blue.""

Now, let's examine ""walm.""

Looking at Inputs 1 and 4:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Both inputs contain ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" and in both cases, the outputs are a series of ""green(s)"" followed by the colors associated with the other words. ""lug"" does not seem to have a corresponding color in the output, so it could be irrelevant or a placeholder.

Looking at Input 5:

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

We see ""dax,"" followed by ""wif,"" followed by ""walm."" The output is ""green red"" followed by a series of ""red"" colors. ""walm"" in this context appears to extend the series of ""red"" colors started by ""wif.""

Now, considering Input 2:

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

The pattern is similar. ""dax walm"" once again results in a series of ""green"" colors, even though ""walm"" comes at the end of the input. This suggests that the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in an extension of the ""green"" color series.

Finally, let's analyze Input 3:

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

In this sequence, the ""walm"" at the end extends the ""red"" series that precedes it, associated with the word ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we can draft the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> When following a color-associated word, ""walm"" extends the series of that color in the output.

For example, when following ""dax"" which is associated with ""green,"" ""walm"" results in more ""green"" in the sequence. Similarly, when following ""wif"" which is associated with ""red,"" ""walm"" results in more ""red"" in the sequence.",-0.2200297832416,142,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" by comparing the outputs related to the presence of ""walm"" and other words.

In every example where ""walm"" appears:
- The output always contains a sequence of green.
- The sequence of green repeats as many times as there are words before ""walm"" plus one additional green.

Let's consider the number of greens in each output compared to the position of ""walm"":

1. Input: ""dax walm zup lug"" has 3 greens followed by yellow, blue.
2. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" has 3 greens followed by green.
3. Input: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" has 6 reds after the word ""walm.""
4. Input: ""dax walm"" has exactly 3 greens.
5. Input: ""dax wif walm"" has 3 reds following the word ""walm.""

Considering this pattern, we come to the rule that the word ""walm"" results in an output of a sequence of green where the number of green outputs is one more than the number of words before ""walm."" If there is a word following ""walm,"" the outputs for those are not ""green,"" and the color after the series of greens appears to be dependent on that specific word rather than ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> For each word preceding ""walm,"" output ""green,"" and add one additional ""green"" output.",-0.4637675556174441,142,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns and correlations between inputs and their corresponding outputs. In each input, the occurrence of ""dax"" consistently yields a ""green"" in the output, suggesting ""dax"" equates to ""green."" However, we need more information on ""walm"" outside its connection to ""dax.""

Let's inspect the occurrences:

1. ""dax walm"" consistently leads to ""green green green"" in the output − no matter how many other words follow, suggesting that ""walm"" is closely related to ""dax"" or possibly intensifies the ""green"" output.
   
2. ""walm"" standalone does not have an independent output; it always follows ""dax,"" which means we do not know the color it represents by itself.
   
3. ""wif,"" on the other hand, is seen correlating with ""red"" regardless of position or what follows. Thus, ""wif"" -> red.
   
4. In the last example where ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in an additional ""red"" instead of ""green."" This might indicate that ""walm"" emulates or repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output indicated by the immediately preceding word. If this is the case, then ""walm"" functions as a duplicator or intensifier of the previous word's output.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"".
3. In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"".
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"".
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"".

Now, let's analyze the positions where ""walm"" changes its color:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" directly, it produces ""green"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it produces ""red"".

It seems that ""walm"" takes its color from the previous word:

- If the previous word is ""dax"", the color is ""green"".
- If the previous word is ""wif"", the color is ""red"".

Based on the given examples, walm seems to repeat the color produced by the word immediately preceding it three times. For instance:

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

- In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" with the output being ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" The ""yellow yellow yellow"" could be the result of ""zup walm,"" while ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug.""
  
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears twice: once after ""wif"" and once before ""lug."" Since ""wif"" results in ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" we can observe that the parts containing ""walm"" result in triple repetition of the color that proceeds it (before ""lug"" we get triple ""blue"" and after ""wif"" we get triple ""red"").

- The third example reinforces this triple color repetition before a single color, with ""lug walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue.""

- The fourth example shows ""dax zup dax walm,"" with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Only ""dax"" is repeated after ""walm,"" giving us ""green green green.""

- The fifth example follows the pattern, with ""dax walm"" giving us ""green green green"" before moving on to other colors corresponding to the other words.

Given these observations, we can infer the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.

"Based on the input and output provided, we can deduce the following associations:

- zup is associated with yellow.
- dax is associated with green.
- lug is associated with blue.
- wif is associated with red.
- walm seems to create a repetition of the color related to the word that immediately follows it.

Let's examine the evidence:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" and walm causes ""yellow yellow yellow"" to occur before ""blue red red"" (blue for lug, red for wif). This demonstrates that walm caused ""lug"" to be repeated three times in its associated color (blue).
  
- In the second example, walm follows ""wif"" making ""red red red"" appear, and later follows ""lug"" making ""blue blue blue"" appear, ensuring that the color repeats threefold for the word that follows walm.

- In the third example, walm appears after ""lug"" and before it is ""blue,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" showing that the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) is being repeated three times.

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" which is associated with green color repeats three times after walm shows up indicating walm repeats the following word's color thrice.

- In the fifth example, walm causes ""green"" to be repeated three times, just as previous examples indicate.

So the rule seems to be that walm repeats the color associated with the following word three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" must also correspond to ""green"" here.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" must also correspond to ""red"" here.
- In the third example, ""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red."" ""Zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""wif"" means ""red."" Thus, in this context, ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow."" Here ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" means ""blue."" So, in this context, ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, which is identical to the second, ""wif bluf"" still translates to ""red red,"" and ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color preceding it in the input sequence. Therefore, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",-0.12086614559534725,145,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze each example and the output that follows it.

1. ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green."" Given that ""zup"" appears in multiple contexts and correlates to ""yellow,"" we can reasonably deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow."" This leaves us with ""dax bluf"" corresponding to ""green green,"" which suggests that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" mean ""green.""

2. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" As both words output ""red,"" it’s plausible ""wif"" also means ""red."" However, ""bluf"" previously corresponded to ""green,"" which conflicts with this result unless ""bluf"" changes meaning based on context, which isn't supported by the data we have so far.

3. ""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red."" We've established ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and ""wif"" as ""red,"" so ""lug bluf"" must correspond to ""blue blue."" This could mean ""lug"" and ""bluf"" both mean ""blue,"" but that would contradict our earlier inference about ""bluf"" meaning ""green.""

4. ""zup bluf lug zup"" turns into ""yellow yellow blue yellow."" Given ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" if ""bluf"" meant ""blue,"" we would not see ""yellow yellow"" in the output. So this sequence contradicts ""bluf"" meaning ""blue.""

5. ""wif bluf"" again yields ""red red."" This reconfirms our observation that ""wif"" means ""red,"" but ""bluf"" is still up for interpretation.

Considering all examples, one possibility is that ""bluf"" is a chameleon word: it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it, which is supported by examples where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow,"" and where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red."" This rule would also explain why ""zup bluf lug zup"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow,"" as ""bluf"" takes on the ""yellow"" from the preceding ""zup,"" then ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" followed by another ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow.""

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color output that immediately follows its appearance. In every instance where ""bluf"" is used, the output color matches the last color mentioned before ""bluf."" Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green,"" which means that ""bluf"" takes the color before it, which is ""green.""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" again takes the color before it, ""red.""
- ""zup lug bluf wif"" results in ""yellow blue blue red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup bluf lug zup"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow,"" and ""bluf"" takes the color ""yellow"" from the word before it.
- The last example is the same as the second, serving as further confirmation of the rule.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that represents the word that precedes it. Here's the pattern that emerges:

- In the first example, ""zup dax bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" hence green.
- In the second and fifth examples, ""wif bluf,"" the word ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" thus red.
- In the third example, ""zup lug bluf wif,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" blue, and then ""wif"" is red.
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf lug zup,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the first ""zup,"" yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and the last ""zup"" is again yellow.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" takes the color corresponding to the immediate word before ""bluf"".",-0.3738817383366666,145,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" first let's look at the consistent patterns related to the example inputs and their respective outputs:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- For ""dax,"" the output is ""green,"" and for ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""

Analyzing the example outputs that correlate to the presence of ""bluf,"" it seems that:

- ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup"" and ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- ""bluf"" occurs after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" is within a sequence, it doesn't have a consistent color output associated with it independent of the preceding word.
  
From the given examples, ""bluf"" appears to take on the color of the word that is immediately before it. So if the word before ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""green,"" then ""bluf"" would output ""green"" as well. The same pattern occurs with ""red"" and ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.",-0.7561861315236112,145,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to find patterns in the examples given. Let's examine how the word ""walm"" affects the output in each input:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in two additional yellow outputs; ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in two additional red outputs.

2. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in additional blue outputs; ""walm"" after ""zup"" again results in additional yellow outputs; ""walm"" after ""wif"" again results in additional red outputs. 

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in additional green outputs.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in additional yellow outputs, consistent with previous examples.

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in additional blue outputs, consistent with previous examples.

From these examples, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it twice more.

Therefore, the rule induction for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repetition of the last color word mentioned two additional times.",-0.06655735181926213,145,walm
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word that comes just before it. Here are some explanations based on each input/output combination:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - After ""zup"", ""walm"" causes the color yellow to repeat.
   - Then ""wif"" produces red, and the subsequent ""walm"" repeats the color red.

2. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red.
   - ""lug walm"" gives two blues because ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"".
   - ""zup"" is associated with yellow, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the yellow.
   - Finally, ""wif"" once again outputs red.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.
   - The ""walm"" after ""dax"" repeats the color green.
   - ""lug"" independently corresponds to blue.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - The word ""zup"" outputs yellow, and the subsequent ""walm"" causes the yellow to repeat twice.

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and these are repeated.
   - After the last ""lug"", ""walm"" causes the color blue to repeat.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" functions as a word that causes the color output of the word immediately preceding it to repeat.

"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule or meaning behind the nonce word ""walm."" Let's examine each input and its corresponding output and look for patterns related to the occurrences of ""walm.""

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

In this example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow,"" which corresponds to the word ""zup"" that comes just before the first ""walm."" After the second ""walm,"" there are three ""red,"" which corresponds to the word ""wif"" that comes just before the second ""walm."" 

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and the ""walm"" is represented as three ""blue."" The second ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to three ""yellow."" 

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

In this case, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the ""walm"" is represented as three ""green,"" which is also the corresponding color for ""dax."" 

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and it is represented by three ""yellow,"" which is also the color for ""zup.""

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Following the pattern, ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" which corresponds with the color ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is represented as three repetitions of ""blue.""

The rule seems consistent across all examples:

Walm -> The color corresponding to the word that directly precedes ""walm,"" repeated three times.",-0.08158525127822325,145,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" in the input translates to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the output. Here is the reasoning:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" it results in two additional ""yellow"" in the output. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it results in two additional ""red"" in the output.

2. In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Following this pattern, when ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" it results in two additional ""blue"" before the color changes back to ""yellow"" for ""zup."" Afterwards ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" twice and then ""wif"" changes it to ""red"" once.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" repeating the ""green"" color twice.

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and repeats the ""yellow"" color twice.

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" repeating the ""blue"" color three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word an additional number of times, with the number of repetitions being equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears in sequence.

"To deduce the rule for the meaning of ""dax,"" let us examine the given examples. We see that each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears once in the output. The position of ""green"" correlates with the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. 

For instance, in the first example, ""dax"" is the first word in the input, and ""green"" is the first color in the output. In the second example, ""dax"" is the second word, and ""green"" is the second color in the output.

This pattern holds across all provided examples, regardless of what other words (""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") are present or their order in the input.

- In ""zup walm dax lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is output three times (since ""zup"" precedes ""walm"") before the sequence continues with ""dax"" and ""lug"" corresponding to green and blue, respectively.

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" as in ""zup walm,"" ""yellow"" is output three times, coinciding with the number of letters in ""zup.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""bluf"" as in ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" even though ""bluf"" is not illustrated directly, it appears to correspond to a single repetition of a color, and given the context, that color must also be ""yellow,"" since ""walm"" duplicates the yellow output.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" as in ""wif walm,"" ""red"" is output three times, according to the number of letters in ""wif.""

3. dax -> green (consistent in examples 1 and 2)
4. bluf -> blue (consistent in example 4)

Now, to deduce the meaning of 'walm', we'll examine its occurrences and the associated colors:

- Example 1: walm follows 'zup,' and the corresponding output is 'yellow.'
- Example 2: walm follows 'dax' and the output after walm continues the color pattern from prior to 'walm,' which is 'green.'
- Example 3: walm follows 'zup' and the output pattern for 'walm' is consistent with 'zup,' which is 'yellow.'
- Example 4: walm follows 'zup bluf lug zup,' and the output is a continuation of the 'yellow' pattern, which 'zup' produces.
- Example 5: walm follows 'wif,' where 'wif' produces 'red,' and similarly, 'walm' continues this 'red' pattern.

From these observations, it appears that 'walm' is a word that continues the color pattern of the word immediately before it. If 'walm' is preceded by a word that corresponds to a color, the output for 'walm' would be that same color repeating as many times as the preceding color.

5. Input: dax zup lug wif lug / Output: green yellow blue red blue

From the examples, we can derive the following associations:
- Whenever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- Other words like ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively.

- The other words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"") correspond to different colors (""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""blue"" respectively).

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" directly influences the output's color sequence. Each occurrence of ""walm"" seems to lead to a repetition of the color that directly precedes it. I will examine each input and its corresponding output to deduce the rule:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is associated with ""yellow."" Thus, ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif

   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" leading to the repetition of ""green"".

3. Input: zup walm

   - As in the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is a repetition of ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif walm dax zup

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm

From the patterns observed, it seems ""walm"" acts as a rule to reproduce the color associated with the word that comes before it. It can be noted that the presence of ""walm"" does not change the color associated with the words that follow it but only affects the color that directly precedes it.

Therefore, the rule is:
walm -> Reproduce the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the repetition of the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes it, for as many times as it is present in the sequence.",-0.11177620869211763,147,walm
"From the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern related to the word 'walm' and the colors that come after it in the output. Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""

From examples 1 and 3, we can see that ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces a repeated color (three times yellow), which suggests that 'walm' after 'zup' simply repeats the color associated with 'zup', which is yellow.

In example 2, 'walm' appears after 'dax' and again repeats the color associated with 'dax', which is green.

In examples 4 and 5, 'walm' follows 'dax' and 'bluf', each associated with the colors green and red respectively — and after 'walm', those colors are repeated.

From these observations, we can construct the following rule:

Rule: Walm after any word causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Given the consistency across all examples, we can define 'walm' as follows:

walm -> Triggers the repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence three times.",-0.13698640383941174,147,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns before and after its appearances and the associated outputs.

From the first and third examples:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

It appears that ""walm"" directly follows ""zup"" and the output is thrice the color associated with ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

However, the other examples show different colors following the word ""walm"" so we must consider more context. 

Looking at the second input and output:
- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
- Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Here, ""walm"" is after ""dax"" and before ""zup."" The output associated with ""walm"" is ""green,"" which coincides with ""dax."" Therefore, ""walm"" may be taking on the output of the color associated with the word immediately before it (""dax"").

Considering the fourth input and output:
- Input: wif walm dax zup
- Output: red red red green yellow

""Walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated thrice just like ""yellow"" was repeated after ""zup"" in the first and third examples. This suggests ""walm"" may result in repeating the color associated with the word before it.

Looking at the final input and output:
- Input: wif bluf dax walm
- Output: red red green green green

Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" and again we see ""green"" repeated for ""walm"" as it is associated with ""dax.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" results in a triplet output of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif -> Output: yellow green green green yellow red

"Based on the examples provided, one can make the following observations:

1. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" alone represents ""yellow"" and adding ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" outputs, one possibility is that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color before it.

2. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red"". It seems ""dax"" stands for ""green"" and ""wif"" for ""red"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in two additional ""green"" outputs, which further supports the repetition rule.

3. In all examples where ""walm"" is present, the color preceding it is repeated two more times.

4. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" in the last example, ""red red green green green"" is the output, again indicating a repetition of the preceding color.

bluf -> red,-1.7526666838488636,148,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the contexts it appears in and compare the inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
2. ""dax walm zup lug"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue""
3. ""dax walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red""
4. ""lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue green green green""
5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""

Looking at these examples, we can see:

- When ""walm"" appears following ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears following ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears following ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated but not three times — possibly because ""wif"" interrupts the sequence.
- However, when ""walm"" appears following ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, it seems ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. However, the sequence can be interrupted by the insertion of another word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.07953229042889998,148,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" impacts the output in the following ways:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, a sequence of the same color is produced in the output.
2. The number of colors in the sequence equals the number of times ""walm"" is repeated plus two.
3. The color that is repeated appears to correspond to the color value of the word that comes right before ""walm"".

Let's look at each example:

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (3 times, since ""lug"" = blue).
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red red red"" (3 times, since ""wif"" = red).

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"" (3 times, since ""dax"" = green).

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"" (3 times, since ""dax"" = green).
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red red red"" (3 times, since ""wif"" = red).

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"" (3 times, since ""dax"" = green).

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (3 times, since ""lug"" = blue).

From this, we can derive that:
- ""walm"" causes the color represented by the previous word to be outputted three times, adding to the normal single instance that would have been outputted without ""walm"".
- If ""walm"" is repeated, we add two more instances for each repetition on top of the original three.

So the rule is:
Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three additional times.",-0.10504890651010002,148,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated three times. For example, in the input ""dax walm zup lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and since ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green."" Similarly, if ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, the output is ""blue blue blue.""",-1.2401218546714998,148,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the occurrences of the nonce word ""walm"" and its corresponding output colors to deduce its meaning. 

In each example, the word ""walm"" appears to be followed by a series of colors that are identical and the number of times that color repeats corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.

- In the first example, a single ""walm"" is followed by a ""wif"" and then a second ""walm"", producing the output ""blue blue red red red"". 
- In the second and fourth examples, a single ""walm"" produces a triple repetition of the following color (green or blue, respectively).
- In the third example, a single ""walm"" followed by a ""wif"" and then another ""walm"", results in the output ""green green green red red red"". 
- In the last example, a single ""walm"" is at the end and results in a single ""green"" after a series of other colors.

From these observations, we can infer a rule for ""walm"": When ""walm"" appears, it causes the next color to be repeated three times if it's the only ""walm"", or multiplied by the number of consecutive ""walm"" instances. For example, one ""walm"" would mean the color repeats three times, while two consecutive ""walms"" would result in the color repeating six times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to be repeated three times, or three times the count of consecutive ""walm"" instances.",-1.3887998252830003,148,walm
"Based on the examples provided, there is a pattern that emerges with respect to the word ""walm"" and the colors that follow it. It appears that ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated three times. However, the specific color that is to be repeated three times seems to be dependent on the word that follows ""walm"" immediately. Here are the associations:

- When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- We do not see a directly following word for ""walm"" in the first example, but it is followed by ""wif"" and the output is ""blue red red red,"" indicating that the ""blue"" is not necessarily associated with the word ""walm"" but may be a result of some other word we don't have information on. Therefore, we can disregard that first instance.

With the data given, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated three times. If the next word is ""wif,"" then ""walm"" results in ""red red red,"" and if the next word is ""dax,"" then ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

Without seeing what color ""walm"" directly corresponds to by itself or without the next word's influence, this is the best rule that fits the given data. It should be noted that if more data were available, especially instances where ""walm"" is not directly followed by any of the described words, a more accurate and comprehensive definition of ""walm"" could be deduced.",-1.391093820614,148,walm

- ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" (third example)
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" (fourth and fifth examples)

- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" because ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" following the same logic, with ""zup"" being yellow.

- After ""zup"" which is yellow, yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" (an additional two yellows after the one naturally produced by the word ""zup"").",-0.9055248279917003,149,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will look for patterns associated with ""walm"" corresponding to the colors in the outputs:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (first example), the output is ""red red blue yellow yellow yellow"". When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (second and fifth examples), the output is ""green green red red red"". When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (third example), the output is ""yellow blue"". When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (fourth example), the output is ""blue blue blue"".

2. Each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of colors in the output. The sequence always starts with the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" followed by a sequence of colors that don't appear to relate directly to any other words. The sequence's length also matches the quantity of ""walm"" words in the input after that specific word.

For example:
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red blue yellow yellow yellow"" (sequence length of six, starts with ""red"" from ""wif"")
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green red red red"" (sequence length of five, starts with ""green"" from ""dax"")
- etc.

3. ""Walm"" doesn't seem to correspond to a single static color or rule related to its position in the list of words. Instead, it appears to initiate a color sequence influenced by the preceding word and the number of times ""walm"" is repeated, but the exact rule for the color sequence is not obvious from the given examples.

Based on these observations, I can infer that ""walm"" acts as a variable or modifier that triggers a sequence of colors beginning with the color of the word before it, but without further context or examples, the complete rule behind the sequence of colors following ""walm"" cannot be precisely defined.

Given the above analyses, we can state:

walm -> meaning: Walm appears to initiate a color sequence that starts with the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm."" The full rule for the sequence generated by ""walm"" is undetermined based on the provided examples.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is encountered, the output starts with the color corresponding to the preceding word, followed by a sequence the rule of which is unknown within the context given.",-1.0828791613094002,149,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns of input and corresponding output:

1. Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, there are multiple ""red"" or ""green"" outputs following it. This suggests that ""walm"" is likely to be related to the repetition of the color immediately preceding it.

2. In instances where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), the output is multiple ""green."" Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), the output is multiple ""red.""

3. The number of repeated colors corresponds to the position of ""walm"" within the input. For example, in the second input ""dax walm wif walm,"" there are three ""green"" followed by three ""red,"" indicating that the number of repetitions might be dependent on the word's order in the sequence (in this case, the second and fourth positions).

Based on the above observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated an amount of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the word sequence.

Thus:
walm -> The rule is that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color word that comes just before it, repeating that color as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",-1.2478608045099995,149,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, extending for a number of instances equal to the total number of words in the input after ""walm"".

Explanation:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" which is associated with the color blue is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow"". Considering there are three words after ""walm"", the blue color is repeated three times.

2. In the second example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""green green green"". Since there are three words after ""walm"" in the input, the color green is repeated three times.

3. In the third example, ""lug"" associated with blue is followed by ""walm"". Since there is only one word after ""walm"", the color blue is repeated only once.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" associated with blue is followed by ""walm"" and considering there are three words after ""walm"" in the input, we get ""blue blue blue"".

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" associated with green is followed by ""walm"". Since there are two words after ""walm"" in the input, the color green is repeated twice.

- Consistent with previous patterns, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Input: wif walm

- The first ""red"" corresponds to ""wif,"" and given the previous rule deduced for ""walm,"" the other two ""red"" would imply ""walm"" means ""red"" here, which contradicts the previous example.

Based on the given examples, the most consistent rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we'll examine the input-output pairs to identify any patterns that can reveal what ""wif"" might indicate.

- The first example shows ""wif"" by itself corresponding to ""red.""
- The second example includes ""wif,"" and it still corresponds to ""red."" The word ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" and it corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""zup"" appears at the beginning and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The third example has ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" throughout. The word ""dax"" appears between two ""wif"" words and corresponds to ""green.""

- When ""wif"" appears by itself, the output is singular: ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears with ""lug"" (which is probably ""blue""), the resulting output includes ""red"" alongside ""yellow"" and ""blue"" (""lug""), fitting the sequence.
- When ""wif"" appears three times in an input with other words (""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup""), it corresponds to three instances of ""red"" in the output, with other colors in between.
- When ""wif"" and ""dax"" appear with ""zup"" and ""walm,"" the output follows the same pattern – ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" ""red"" for ""wif,"" and ""green"" for both ""dax"" and ""walm.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" followed by the color for ""walm,"" which seems to be ""green"" repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems quite clear:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.8582765092910258,150,wif
"After examining the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word is associated with a unique color. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in all examples. The task seems to be translating a sequence of nonce words into associated colors. Following this pattern, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"". 

Based on the examples:
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, as seen in the presence of ""green"" following ""dax"" in multiple instances.
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to green, as noticed in the examples where ""walm"" is present and the fact that the color green follows it.
-""bluf""'s corresponding color is not shown, but based on the context, it seems logical to infer that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red, likely due to the repeated pattern where ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and both translate to the color red.

Given these observations, the rule can be stated as:

- Input: ""zup dax bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow green green""

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given examples and their outputs.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

If we look at the first and second examples, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" while ""lug wif bluf"" leads to ""blue red red."" Here, we can guess that ""lug"" means blue and ""wif"" means red, since these associations are consistent in both examples. Given this guess, it would suggest that ""bluf"" means yellow when it follows ""zup,"" but red when it follows ""wif."" But since the output for ""bluf"" in the second example is still the same color twice (red red), this rule isn't quite right.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

This is a repetition of the first example and confirms the association of ""zup bluf"" with ""yellow yellow.""

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue

Here ""lug wif"" yields ""blue red"" as before. ""dax"" gets associated with green when it's before ""bluf."" Also, ""bluf"" following ""dax"" outputs green green; following ""wif lug"" outputs red blue, which is the output for each of those words on their own. 

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

In the last example, ""dax lug"" yields ""green blue,"" and the presence of ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green red red green."" Here, ""wif bluf"" might lead to ""green red,"" and ""bluf dax"" to ""red green.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word preceding it followed by the color output of the word following it. However, this doesn't hold consistently since in the second example, ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"" and not ""blue red"" which would follow the rule suggested by later examples.

The examples contain contradictions and do not clearly demonstrate a consistent pattern. To reach an accurate conclusion, we would need more data or examples that establish a clear pattern for the meaning of ""bluf.""

Rule:
Given the inconsistencies and lack of a clear pattern, it is difficult to determine a precise rule for ""bluf.""

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs with their respective outputs. Let's analyze each example:

- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow 
- Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red

In the first two examples, ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of the color that is translated from the word just before ""bluf."" 

- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow (Repeats the ""yellow"" from ""zup"")
- Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red (Repeats the ""red"" from ""wif"")

- Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output for each example. We want to look for patterns in the context of the word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow.""

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red."" This is the first instance where ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""yellow,"" indicating that the word preceding ""bluf"" likely affects its meaning.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- This confirms that when ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue
- In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and considering the pattern of other color outputs and their repetition, ""bluf"" appears to take on the color ""green"" when following ""dax.""

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- In this last example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red."" But it's worth noting that there are two instances of ""red"" following ""bluf"" here, which may imply that ""bluf"" requires duplication of the color that follows it.

Based on these observations, it appears that the output color for ""bluf"" is determined by the word that comes right before it, and it causes duplication of the corresponding color in the output. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color is ""yellow."" When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color is ""red."" When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color is ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the following color in the sequence provided by the word that immediately precedes it in the input.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Duplication of the color corresponding to the word that comes right before ""bluf.""",-0.1372136016503721,150,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns and consistent correlations in the examples provided. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""yellow"" since ""zup"" is consistently translated as ""yellow."" However, we need more examples to confirm this because ""bluf"" could also be a duplicate function, simply duplicating the previous word's color.

- In the second example, ""lug wif bluf"" becomes ""blue red red."" This example suggests that ""bluf"" does not mean ""yellow,"" as ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" following ""wif,"" ""bluf"" could potentially mean to repeat the color before it or to turn into the word ""red"" itself when preceded by ""wif.""

- The third example is identical to the first, reinforcing the initial translation.

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" Here, ""bluf"" is following ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and since ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" this time, it leads to the hypothesis that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word immediately before it. ""wif"" in this case is followed by ""lug,"" and so ""wif"" translates ""lug"" to ""red"", therefore ""wif"" could be a colour changer.

- In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" Here, ""bluf"" once again translates to ""red,"" implying a repeated color or a transformation to ""red,"" but it's following ""wif"" again.

From these examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" is likely a function that repeats the color word immediately preceding it, but when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it instead translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word immediately before it, but if preceded by ""wif,"" translate to ""red"".",-0.1657525591688372,150,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears singularly after one word, it translates to a single color repeated twice.
- When ""bluf"" appears in a sequence with multiple other words, it translates to the color ""red"" and is followed by repeating the sequence of colors representing the words preceding it.

For example, in the first case ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" must correspond to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" then translates to ""yellow yellow"" which is the repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word. In the second example, ""lug wif bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", with ""bluf"" translating to ""red red"", again repeating the color of the preceding word.

However, in the fourth example, there is a sequence ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"", and ""bluf"" is translated to green, followed by the sequence ""green red blue"". This is a peculiar outlier that contradicts the initial rule established with the first two examples, which indicates that the rule might be more complex.

Taking the fourth example into account, it seems ""bluf"" corresponds to the sequence ""green"" followed by the replication of the sequence of colors of the words before ""bluf"". The output includes an extra ""green"" before ""red blue"" which are the colors corresponding to ""wif"" and ""lug"" respectively.

The fifth example further supports the more complex rule, as ""bluf"" occurs after ""dax lug walm dax wif"" and results in ""red red"" (the color representation for ""bluf"") followed by ""green blue blue blue green"" which is the sequence of colors for the words ""dax lug walm dax wif"".

Thus, we can deduce a rule:

Rule: In the sequence, when ""bluf"" appears, translate it to the color ""red"", and if any words precede ""bluf"", repeat the sequence of their corresponding colors afterward.

Based on the established rule, we can state:
bluf -> red, and repeat the sequence of colors representing the words preceding ""bluf"".",-0.4568167021477908,150,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"" based on the provided examples, we will first observe the pattern of colors in the output sequences. Let's consider the output colors corresponding to the presence of ""walm"":

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
2. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   
3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   
5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   
Now, let's analyze the colors before and after ""walm"" in each instance:

1. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the colors red red red follow.
2. ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup,"" resulting in green green followed by yellow.
3. ""walm"" follows ""lug wif"" and the colors are blue blue blue.
4. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" within the sequence and is followed by ""zup,"" with the corresponding colors being green green followed by yellow.
5. ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif lug,"" with the resulting colors being yellow yellow followed by red blue.

Looking closely, ""walm"" seems to be associated with producing a sequence of three repeated colors. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the following three color outputs are the same:

1. red red red
2. green green green
3. blue blue blue
4. green green green
5. yellow yellow yellow

But there's another element to consider: the color before ""walm"" changes in the fifth example. When ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" the three repeated colors change from the typical sequence to yellow. This suggests that the color before ""walm"" influences what the triplet color will be.

Analyzing further, if we look at the word preceding ""walm"" in each input, we find the corresponding color for that word, which then repeats three times after ""walm.""

1. ""wif"" -> red -> red red red
2. ""dax"" -> green -> green green green
3. ""lug"" -> blue -> blue blue blue
4. ""dax"" -> green -> green green green
5. ""zup"" -> yellow -> yellow yellow yellow

When ""lug wif"" appears before ""walm,"" ""wif"" seems to be the influencing word as ""lug"" is repeated before the ""walm"" triplet.

Thus, ""walm"" appears to represent the rule of repeating the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",-0.06568620207459999,150,walm
"To figure out the meaning of walm, we should look at each example and see where it's positioned and how the output changes based on its placement. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
   Here, walm comes after zup and wif. We see a ""yellow"" for zup and a series of ""red"" following it.

2. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   
   In this example, walm comes after dax and before zup. ""Green"" corresponds to dax and ""yellow"" to zup, while walm produces a series of ""green.""

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   Here, walm follows wif and lug, which yield ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively. After walm, we see a repetition of ""blue.""

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   
   Walm is positioned after lug, wif, and dax, which are followed respectively by ""blue"", ""red"", and ""green."" After the appearance of walm, there’s an extension of ""green"" until zup, which changes the color to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   
   In this case, walm is between a ""yellow"" corresponding to zup and a repeat of wif and lug. After walm, we notice a repetition of the ""yellow"" color.

From the above examples, walm seems to cause a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. 
   
Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> causes the color of the word before it to repeat.

Rule: If walm follows a word that produces a certain color, the output is a series of that color until the next color is introduced by a different word.",-0.07343367891611112,150,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe the relations between the input and output sequences. Let's analyze each example:

2. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   
3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   
5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Looking at the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color that comes before it three times.

In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which gives ""red,"" thus ""walm"" causes it to output ""red red red.""
In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" associated with ""green,"" thus ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
Example 3 and 4 demonstrate the same pattern with ""blue blue blue"" and ""green green green,"" respectively.
Finally, in example 5, ""walm"" results in three yellows following ""zup"" which outputs one yellow.

So based on this pattern, the rule seems to be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" we can compare the inputs with their respective outputs to identify patterns:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red:
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems to produce ""red red""

2. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow:

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" seems to produce ""green green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

5. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue:

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" seems to produce ""yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Looking at the patterns, we can notice that ""walm"" is producing a repetition of the color that directly follows it in the input sequence. When there's no color-word after ""walm"", as in the first input, it repeats the last known color-word which is ""wif"": red.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" results in a repetition of the color-word that directly follows it; if there is no color-word that follows, ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned.

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in green repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" is followed by blue repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup"" results in green repeated twice, followed by yellow (likely because ""zup"" follows, which corresponds to yellow based only on this and the first example).
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" leads to yellow repeated three times, later followed by ""wif lug"" which corresponds to red and blue.

In all instances, ""walm"" seems to cause the next color to repeat. Additionally, ""walm"" seems to take effect after it is encountered, causing the color word immediately preceding it to repeat and not affect the color word that follows.

Here, ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" but let's look further for confirmation.

2. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> ""blue green red blue""

3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Note that ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""blue,"" perhaps due to some repetition effect.

4. ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue""
The word ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and produces ""green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may have a modifying effect on the word ""dax"" or vice versa. However, when ""lug"" is last, its color is ""blue.""

5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
Here, ""dax"" seems to be followed by another color term, ""green."" Without additional examples, the specific influence of ""bluf"" is unclear.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

On the other hand, other words like ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""bluf,"" when repeated, correspond to repeating colors (e.g., ""lug"" appears twice in the second input -> ""blue"" appears twice in the output). ""Walm"" seems to always translate to ""blue,"" regardless of its position, indicating that each word translates to a specific color.

Thus, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.13889301626913042,151,dax
"From the given examples, we can see a pattern emerging regarding the word 'dax' and the corresponding output 'green'. 

In the first input example ""dax zup,"" 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'. 

In the second example, the color 'green' occurs in the second position following 'lug', which corresponds to 'blue'. 'wif' corresponds to 'red'. Since 'lug' appears twice and both times it corresponds to 'blue', we can assume 'lug' consistently means 'blue' and 'dax' consistently means 'green', since it appears in different input positions but always results in 'green' in the output.

The third example, 'dax lug walm', again shows 'dax' leading to 'green'. Here 'walm' seems to correspond to 'blue', as the output is 'green blue blue blue'. In the fourth example, 'dax walm lug', we see a repetition of 'green' three times followed by 'blue', which likely means 'walm' corresponds to 'green' when in the company of 'dax'. 'lug' remains 'blue'.

The fifth example 'dax bluf' yields 'green green', which implies that 'bluf' in the presence of 'dax' corresponds to 'green' as well.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for 'dax':

Rule: The word 'dax' translates to the color 'green' irrespective of the context in which it appears. The other words such as 'lug', 'wif', 'walm', and 'bluf' seem to have their meanings influenced by the presence of 'dax'. However, 'dax' itself consistently results in 'green'.

2. The word ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue."" When ""lug"" is mentioned twice, ""blue"" appears twice in the output.
3. The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
4. The word ""walm"" seems to result in either ""blue blue blue"" or ""green green green"" depending on its position relative to ""dax"" and ""lug.""
5. The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

3. Input: lug wif

4. Input: zup wif

5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug

Breaking down the occurrences:

- Every time the word ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" is in the output.
- Every time ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is in the output.

In examples 1 and 3, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""red"" always precedes ""blue"" in the output. In example 4, ""wif"" is following ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow red,"" indicating that ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" since ""zup"" is already established to correlate with ""yellow."" Example 2 reaffirms this pattern, as ""wif"" once again results in ""red"" in the output sequence. Finally, example 5 shows ""wif"" followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to the output ""red green,"" and we've observed that ""walm lug"" consistently maps to ""green blue."" This suggests ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" reaffirming that ""wif"" is constant in its representation of ""red.""

Therefore, based on the examples provided, it can be induced that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf

"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns and the resulting outputs from each input.

- When ""lug"" is present, the output contains ""blue."" Since all inputs containing ""lug"" result in at least one ""blue"" in the output, we can deduce that ""lug"" likely means ""blue.""
- ""zup"" appears to correspond with ""yellow,"" as every input with ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" being part of the output.
- ""walm"" seems to be related to ""green,"" given that when ""walm"" is in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- ""wif"" appears with different colors in the output: ""red"" appears every time ""wif"" is used.
- ""bluf"" and ""dax"" do not provide enough instances to deduce their meanings confidently based on the provided data.

From the given inputs and outputs, ""wif"" correlates directly with the appearance of ""red"" in the output. Following these observations, we can propose the following rule:

"Based on the given examples, we can infer that 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Every instance where 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the output. There is no variation in this pattern, therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the meaning of 'wif' is consistently 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red",-1.9473740403693334,151,wif
"Rule: ""zup"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word one extra time. 

Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. ""dax zup dax"" translates to ""green yellow green"". Since ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", zup causes the preceding ""green"" to be repeated once, resulting in ""yellow"".

2. ""wif walm zup walm"" gives us ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and ""walm"" is associated with ""yellow"". The zup here follows ""walm"" and repeats ""yellow"" once more, resulting in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"".

3. ""dax zup"" becomes ""green yellow"". Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", which repeats ""green"" once, leading to ""yellow"".

4. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". The pattern indicates that ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", ""walm"" with ""yellow"", and ""wif"" with ""red"". Here, ""zup"" follows both ""walm"" and ""lug"", and in both cases, it repeats the color associated with the word before it.

5. ""zup dax walm"" turns into ""yellow green green green"". The ""zup"" at the beginning repeats the color of ""dax"" (""green""), and since there is no preceding color, it seems to initiate the sequence with ""yellow"". This case is unique because ""zup"" precedes any color words, which suggests that ""zup"" can also initiate a sequence with its own associated ""yellow"" when not following another color word.

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" is that it repeats the color associated with the preceding word one more time, except when it initiates the sequence, where it is translated as ""yellow"". 

zup -> repeat the color of the preceding word one more time, or ""yellow"" if it starts the sequence.",-0.106068000123,151,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" I'll look at each instance where it appears and the associated output.

Looking at the first three examples:

- ""dax zup dax"" becomes ""green yellow green"". Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" seems to be introducing ""yellow"" in between the two occurrences of ""green.""
- ""wif walm zup walm"" turns into ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" is not shown in the output, ""walm"" corresponds to two instances of ""yellow,"" and there's an additional ""yellow"" which seems to be introduced by ""zup.""
- ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and the solitary ""zup"" leads to a ""yellow"" following it.

In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" we get ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" is again corresponding to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" appears to introduce an additional ""yellow"" each time it appears. ""wif"" at the end translates to ""red.""

Lastly, in ""zup dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" and the standalone ""zup"" at the beginning is introducing a ""yellow."" 

It seems that ""zup"" adds ""yellow"" either between repeated colors or as a standalone color when it follows a different color, but it gets a bit more complicated when looking at the fifth example since it introduces a ""yellow"" at the beginning of the sequence without a preceding color.

From these examples, we can infer that ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it appears to add ""yellow"" to the sequence, independent of the context.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" (Introduces the color yellow at the position where ""zup"" appears in the input sequence.)",-0.1167697762517647,151,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" modifies the color word that follows it by repeating it the number of times corresponding to its order in a pre-defined sequence of colors. Referring to the examples, ""zup"" precedes colors in a specific order: green, yellow, blue, and red. The rule seems to involve repeating the color words after ""zup"" according to their position in this sequence. Here is the analysis:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), ""green"" is said once if ""zup"" is in position 1, and ""yellow"" is said once as it is the second color in the sequence.
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" (which appears to correspond to yellow), ""yellow"" is said three times because ""zup"" is in the third position in the sequence.
- If ""zup"" has no color word following it (like in ""dax zup""), the next color in the sequence is used (""green yellow"").
- In the case of multiple ""zups,"" each one follows the sequence (e.g., from ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"", ""zup"" modifies ""lug"" to blue followed by yellow, and then ""lug"" to blue again, followed by ""zup"" which modifies ""wif"" to red, indicating the progression through the sequence).

These observations lead to the following conclusion:

Rule: ""zup"" -> Causes the color term that follows it to be repeated according to its position in a predetermined sequence of colors: green (1), yellow (2), blue (3), red (4), and then wrapping back to green. If no color term follows it, the color that corresponds to its next position in the sequence is used.",-0.9668782039418826,151,zup
"Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" followed by the color associated with the word that comes after ""zup"".

In contexts where ""zup"" precedes a word, we produce ""yellow"" followed by the color linked to that subsequent word. If ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" we output ""yellow green."" If ""zup"" is at the end of the input or not followed by a word with an assigned color, we only output ""yellow.""

For clarity:
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow,"" but when ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" it produces ""yellow"" before repeating the color sequence for ""walm.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

The pattern is consistent across all examples provided.",-1.107632396610588,151,zup

"Analyzing the given examples, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""bluf.""

1. In the first example:
Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue
- Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second instance of ""red.""

2. In the second example:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. In the third example:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second instance of ""red"" again.

4. In the fourth example:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second instance of ""red"" once more.

5. The fifth example:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again, similar to example two.

From the first and second rules, we can deduce:

1. ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red when it is preceded by ""wif.""
2. ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow when it is preceded by ""zup.""

Since there are no contradictions in these observations across the examples, we can combine the rules into one:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If preceded by ""zup,"" it is yellow; if preceded by ""wif,"" it is red.

Bluf -> meaning: Bluf corresponds to the color of the word directly preceding it within the given pattern, with the specific mappings of ""zup"" to yellow and ""wif"" to red.",-0.10684770096493976,151,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be translated as ""yellow"" each time it appears. However, there's a pattern where the color before ""bluf"" is repeated. For instance, when ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" When ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output contains consecutive ""red"" as in ""red red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" could mean repeating the color that came before it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the input and the output in each example.

Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

The word ""walm"" appears to add three of the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is three additional greens.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is three additional reds.
- In the third example, similar to the first, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), resulting in three additional greens.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is three additional blues.
- In the fifth example, similar to the second, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in three additional reds.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" means to triple the output color associated with the word that directly precedes it.",-0.07812805255728739,151,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples provided and the corresponding color outputs.

1. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   In this example, 'dax' corresponds to three greens, 'zup' corresponds to three yellows, and these colors repeat exactly in that order.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   In this case, 'zup' gives us yellow, 'wif' gives us red, and the sequence ends with three reds.

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Here, 'dax' translates to three greens, and 'wif' corresponds to a single red.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   From this, 'zup' is associated with a single yellow at the start and end. 'dax' and 'lug' don't translate to a repeating color, suggesting that 'walm' may be causing repetition because 'lug' on its own produces blue once, but here it is repeated thrice before the second 'zup'.

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   In this case, 'lug' seems to correspond to blue, and 'wif' to red, followed by repeating reds.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to cause the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times (seen in examples 1, 2, 4, and 5). However, example 3 presents an anomaly; 'wif' is not repeated three times after 'walm'. This could suggest an additional rule or an exception.

Combining our analysis, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes that color to output three times. Exception to the rule occurs if ""walm"" is preceded directly by ""wif,"" resulting in the color being produced only once.

Therefore:
walm -> Triggers the preceding color word to repeat three times, with a specific exception when following 'wif'.",-0.09611122736856326,151,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns of input and output:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is green.
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is yellow.
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is red.
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is blue.

Let's analyze the patterns when ""walm"" appears:

- In the first example, after ""dax walm,"" we get ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Since we know ""dax"" corresponds to green and there's a sequence of three greens before the sequence of yellows begins, it suggests that ""walm"" might generate two extra green followed by three yellows.
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" to red, the appearance of ""walm"" only corresponds to an additional two reds here.
- In the third example, ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red."" Following the same logic, ""walm"" generates two extra greens here, as ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" produces ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by three blues (as ""lug"" corresponds to blue) and then a yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""blue red red red."" Here again, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" generates an additional two reds.

Drawing upon these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes it twice and then transitions to the color representing the word that follows it, repeating that color three times.

Rule: For a sequence ""X walm Y,"" the output is the color corresponding to X, followed by two repeats of that color, and then three repeats of the color corresponding to Y.

Applying this rule:

- If X is ""dax,"" then the color is green.
- If X is ""zup,"" then the color is yellow.
- If X is ""lug,"" then the color is blue.
- If X is ""wif,"" then the color is red.

Therefore:

walm -> For the word that comes before ""walm,"" replicate its corresponding color two more times, and for the word that comes right after ""walm,"" replicate its corresponding color three times.",-0.259798143123517,151,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word an additional two times.

Explanation:

- In example 1, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" which means ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) two more times, and the same applies to ""zup walm"" which outputs ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 2, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" again showing that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" two more times.
- Example 3, ""dax walm wif,"" follows the same rule for ""dax walm"" but then follows ""wif"" with a single red, since there is no ""walm"" after ""wif.""
- In example 4, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" so here ""walm"" repeats the blue color of ""lug"" additionally two times. The sequence ""zup dax lug walm zup"" confirms this rule once more.
- Example 5 reconfirms the rule with ""lug wif walm,"" where ""walm"" again repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) two additional times.

Thus, walm -> repeat the color of the previous word an additional two times.",-0.5643590388951722,151,walm

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue

By looking at the above pairings, we can see that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times. Therefore, ""walm"" appears to be a rule that directs us to triple the color representation of the prior word.

2. Each time ""lug"" appears, the word before and after it does not affect the output being blue for ""lug"": ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue, ""lug wif dax"" -> blue red green.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's look at the patterns of inputs and outputs. We notice that the position of ""lug"" seems to matter in the output. ""Lug"" consistently results in ""blue"" for every instance. Based on the data available, ""lug"" correlates with a single color output regardless of its position.

- In the first example, where ""lug"" appears in the third position, the corresponding output color is blue. We need more data to establish a pattern.
  
- In the second example, ""lug"" appears in the second and third positions. The corresponding output colors for these positions are both blue.

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" appears in the second and fifth positions, and the output colors for these positions are both blue. 

- In the fifth example, ""lug"" appears in the first position, and the corresponding output color is blue.

3. dax wif bluf -> green red red
4. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
5. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red

Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first and last examples, the word ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" leading to a sequence of “yellow yellow” in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and results in ""green red.""
- In the third example, again ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red.""
- The fourth example has ""bluf"" appearing twice, following ""lug,"" and outputs ""blue blue.""

It is apparent that ""bluf"" is influenced by its preceding word. The rule seems to revolve around duplicating the color of the word that comes before ""bluf."" Let's apply this rule to each case:

1. The word before bluf is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so bluf -> yellow.
2. The word before bluf is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so bluf -> green.
3. The word before bluf is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so bluf -> red.
4. The word before bluf is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so bluf -> blue.
5. The word before bluf is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so bluf -> yellow (first instance) and the word before the second instance of bluf is ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so bluf (second instance) -> yellow.

The rule seems to be: bluf duplicates the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning - duplicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.",-0.10715254188533341,152,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it follows the words ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""zup,"" but it corresponds to the color ""red"" when it follows the word ""dax."" However, in the last example, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup,"" it still translates to ""yellow.""

The patterns can be deduced as follows:

- The first example indicates ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" since it follows the pattern wif (red) lug (blue) zup (yellow).
- The second example has ""bluf"" immediately after ""dax,"" and here ""bluf"" translates to ""green."" The rest of the sequence follows the pattern established in the first example.
- The third example confirms when ""bluf"" is immediately after ""dax,"" it translates to ""green"" (""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"").
- The fourth example shows a double ""bluf,"" which translates to ""blue blue,"" suggesting a duplication effect when ""bluf"" is at the end. But since ""walm"" does not appear in previous examples, its translation is uncertain—assuming ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" given the output has a double ""red.""
- The fifth example again shows ""bluf"" translating to ""yellow"" in both instances, which is consistent with the initial pattern when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup.""

Summarizing the information from the examples, let's derive the following tentative rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" when it follows ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""zup,"" and ""green"" when it follows ""dax."" Additionally, it may have a duplication effect when it appears at the end of a sequence as seen in the fourth example. However, inconsistencies arise with ""walm,"" where ""bluf"" appears to change its subsequent color translation.

Considering all the information and the inconsistencies in the patterns, I conclude:

bluf -> ""yellow"" when following ""wif"", ""lug"", or ""zup"" 
bluf -> ""green"" when following ""dax""
bluf -> duplicates the color if at the end of the sequence (tentative based on one example)

Note: The rule for ""bluf"" duplicating the color in certain scenarios is uncertain and based on limited data. More examples would be needed to solidify this part of the rule.",-0.7512314738500001,152,bluf
"From the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" is directly correlated with the color ""red"". Now, to confirm this relationship, let's analyze the patterns:

1. In the first example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"". However, looking further, the ""yellow"" output might be associated with another word, since ""bluf"" appears only once, but ""yellow"" appears twice. So, we can't confirm the correlation with this example alone.

2. In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", then ""bluf"" is followed by the output ""green"" again. However, right after there's a ""red"", which is not preceded by ""bluf"". Thus, it's unclear whether ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" or ""red"", but there's a pattern suggesting ""red"" emerges as a possible association since ""wif,"" which precedes ""bluf,"" also corresponds to ""red"".

3. In the third example, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". Since ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" again, it strengthens the pattern that ""bluf"" might correspond to ""red"".

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""Walm"" hasn't appeared in previous examples, but ""lug"" did, and it corresponded to ""blue"". Here, ""lug"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""blue"". However, two occurrences of ""red"" precede this, mirroring the pattern of ""wif"" and ""bluf"".

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is systematically translated to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"", however, ""wif"" has previously been established as ""red"", and it appears before and after the two ""yellow"" outputs.

Considering the patterns we've deduced, it appears that ""bluf"" does not consistently translate directly to a single color, as the color immediately following ""bluf"" can vary. However, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that preceded it. In other words, ""bluf"" leads to a duplication of the color that corresponds to the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence.",-0.7649521255764442,152,bluf

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I'll look at the correspondence between the input and output in each example. By doing so, we can identify patterns and likely assign a meaning to ""walm"" within this context.

Let's examine each instance of ""walm"" in the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
2. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
5. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow

From these examples, we can try to discern the rule for ""walm"" based on the color that follows after its use in the output:

- In example 1, after ""walm,"" the color is green. Before ""walm,"" ""dax"" is present, and its corresponding output is green too.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by green, and once again, ""dax"" precedes it.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by yellow, the same as ""zup"" which precedes it.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by blue and preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds with blue.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed first by green (preceded by ""dax"") and then by red (preceded and followed by ""wif""). This could suggest that ""walm"" serves as a duplicate of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

From this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.07214345521322726,152,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's take a look at how it affects the output colors when it appears in the input:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" both of which we see are translated to ""green,"" and is followed by ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" the sequence is ""green green green red red.""

2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (translates to ""yellow"") and is followed by ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") or ""wif"" (which translates to ""red""), we see the sequence of ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" or ""yellow yellow yellow red red.""

3. Similar patterns occur no matter what precedes ""walm""; the color that follows is repeated three times.

These examples suggest that ""walm"" acts as a repeat function where it repeats the color of the word that directly follows it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the following word three times.",-1.0021936904590911,152,walm
"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to influence the color that is outputted. To deduce the meaning, let's look at the patterns that emerge when ""walm"" is used:

1. The color that comes immediately after ""walm"" is always green.
2. If the color before ""walm"" is not green, the colors that come after ""walm"" remain green until a color is reached that is the same as the one before ""walm"".

Now let's test this observation with the examples:
- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. Before ""walm,"" the color is not green, so ""walm"" changes subsequent outputs to green until yellow appears.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to green. The next word is ""wif"", which results in green again and does not change because the previous color (before ""walm"") was already green.
- The third and fourth examples further confirm that the output remains green after ""walm"" until the color that matches the one before ""walm"" appears or the sequence ends.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it changes the output to green for all following items until a color repeats the color that was outputted right before ""walm"".

So, the meaning of ""walm"" can be expressed as:

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll examine each input and its corresponding output, looking for patterns that connect the word ""wif"" to the output color.

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

3. Input: zup wif lug wif
   Output: yellow red blue red

4. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

From these examples, let's scrutinize the role of ""wif"" in each:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""red."" Since ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red red red,"" ""wif"" by itself might be inducing the first ""red.""

2. Without any preceding words, ""wif walm"" gives us ""red red red,"" which matches the number of reds that ""walm"" gave in example 1.

3. Here, ""wif"" occurs twice. First, it follows ""zup,"" yielding ""yellow red,"" and then it precedes ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue red."" Since ""lug"" alone corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" seems to add a ""red"" before the color linked with the next word.

4. In this input, ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""red"" after the ""blue"" associated with ""lug."" This reinforces the notion that ""wif"" adds a ""red"" before the color associated with the subsequent word.

5. ""Wif"" appears first, followed by ""bluf"" and ""dax walm."" ""Bluf"" doesn't appear in any other examples, but considering ""wif"" produces ""red"" before whatever comes next and ""dax"" has consistently resulted in a ""green"" color, ""bluf"" probably corresponds to ""red,"" and ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""

Based on the patterns observed, ""wif"" appears to add a ""red"" before the color that is associated with the next word in the sequence. If there is no following word to provide context (like in Example 2), ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> Adds ""red"" before the color associated with the following word, or translates to ""red"" if there is no following word.",-0.07271145625361447,153,wif
"To determine the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's observe the patterns in which it appears and the relevant outputs.

1. When ""wif"" precedes the word ""walm,"" the output is red repeated for each syllable in ""walm"" (three syllables: wal-m). This is seen in inputs 1. and 2.
   - ""zup wif walm"" generates ""yellow red red red"" (the ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"").
   - ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red.""

2. When ""wif"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug"" or precedes ""lug,"" like in input 3., the output for ""wif"" is red, and for ""lug"" is blue.
   - ""zup wif lug wif"" generates ""yellow red blue red"" (first ""wif"" outputted as red, ""lug"" as blue, second ""wif"" as red).

3. When ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" without ""zup"" or ""dax"" before it, as in input 4., ""wif"" still translates to red and ""lug"" to blue, but ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" to yellow.
   - ""dax zup lug wif lug"" produces ""green yellow blue red blue"" (no ""wif"" before the first ""lug"").

4. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and follows ""dax,"" and is adhered by ""walm,"" like in input 5., there is the repetition of the colors for the syllables of the words following ""wif.""
   - ""wif bluf dax walm"" generates ""red red green green green"" (notice the repetition of green for each syllable of ""walm"").

From these observations, the rule appears to be:

- ""wif"" when immediately preceding a word, causes the output of a color to repeat for each syllable of that word. It itself translates to ""red.""

The rule for ""wif"" is thus:

wif -> Causes the following word's corresponding color to be repeated for the number of syllables in that word; is represented by ""red"" itself.",-0.12686017212530126,153,wif
"Analyzing the given examples:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. wif walm -> red red red
3. zup wif lug wif -> yellow red blue red
4. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

From these examples, we can derive the following observations:

- ""wif walm"" consistently results in ""red red red"".
- ""wif"" followed by ""lug"" results in ""red blue"".
- ""wif"" at the beginning or in the middle of a sequence seems to introduce the color ""red"".
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" repeats the color ""red"" in production.
- ""lug"" after ""wif"" introduces ""blue"", but when ""wif"" follows ""lug"", it produces ""red"".
- ""bluf"" and ""dax"" when following ""wif"" produce ""green"".

Based on the observed pattern, the rule might be:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". When ""wif"" directly precedes another word, that word is repeated as many times as the number of letters it contains, but with the corresponding color mapping (e.g., ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"", since ""walm"" has three letters).

Thus:

wif -> red

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the color patterns and their corresponding words. Observing that ""wif"" appears before different words, it seems that ""wif"" itself doesn't correspond to a single color. Instead, it changes the following word.

Input: zup wif walm 
Output: yellow red red red 

""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" while ""walm"" without ""wif"" in the last example leads to ""green green green."" This indicates that ""wif"" is modifying ""walm"" to change its output from green to red. 

Input: wif lug wif 
Output: red blue red 

Here, ""lug"" by itself corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" before it leads to red. However, the first ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" which is blue, and the second ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" again, going back to red.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug 
Output: green yellow blue red blue 

""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, but ""wif lug"" corresponds to red, again suggesting modification. 

Input: wif bluf dax walm 
Output: red red green green green 

""bluf"" doesn't appear by itself, but ""wif"" preceding it results in double red, which is similar to the first example with ""wif walm"" giving three reds, further supporting the idea of ""wif"" as a modifier.

Based on the examples, ""wif"" seems to convert the color associated with the subsequent word to red, if it would not already give red. If ""wif"" is already followed by a sequence that results in red without it, like ""dax walm"" (green green green), it seems to have no effect, as there is no example where ""wif"" is directly followed by ""dax walm.""

   - Zup triggers the output of ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - Zup triggers ""yellow,"" and each subsequent word triggers a color that corresponds to it.

- In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. 
- In the second example, despite the presence of other words, ""zup"" still results in yellow.
- The third example does not start with ""zup"", but it appears later in the sentence resulting again in yellow, confirming that the position of ""zup"" in the sequence does not affect the color it is associated with.
- The fourth example shows ""zup"" producing yellow no matter its position and repetition.
- The last example confirms the same rule, with ""zup"" producing yellow.

Based on these examples, the occurrences of the word ""zup"" consistently result in the color yellow in the output, regardless of the other words present or the position of ""zup"" in the input. There are no instances where ""zup"" results in any color other than yellow.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at each input and the corresponding output, identifying any patterns that could help us figure out the rule:

- When ""bluf"" appears, the color after ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"".
- This pattern holds true regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input.

Input: wif bluf dax walm

   Output: green green red yellow red

5. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

When dissecting the outputs and correlating them with their inputs, it can be noticed that each unique word ""wif"", ""dax"", ""lug"", ""zup"", ""walm"" is associated with a unique color: ""red"", ""green"", ""blue"", ""yellow"", ""green"" respectively.

In each of the inputs, ""bluf"" is followed by a color output that is a repetition of the previous color mentioned. This suggests that ""bluf"" is a rule that indicates the repetition of the previously mentioned color in the sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",-0.10157060947678655,153,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's observe the position of ""bluf"" in each input and the associated colors in the output.

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
2. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
3. ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""green green red blue""
4. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red""
5. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue""

From observations:

- Every occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the 5th example, ""bluf"" is at the end of the input, and the last color in the output is also ""blue.""

Thus, ""bluf"" could represent two different rules depending on its position:

When ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it takes on that word's associated color, and when it stands alone or is the last word in the sequence, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"":

Rule:
bluf -> When followed by another word, bluf takes the color of the following word. When at the end or alone, bluf corresponds to blue.",-0.11236088168235954,153,bluf
"By examining the examples given, we can look for patterns and try to infer what ""bluf"" means.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""walm,"" and the colors associated with ""dax"" and ""walm"" seem consistent across other examples (""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" -> green), and since ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red,"" it's plausible that ""bluf"" denotes repetition of the color that follows it. 

2. In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" again is followed by ""lug,"" which is consistently blue in other examples, and we see a repetition of the color ""blue"" following ""bluf.""

3. The same can be observed in the third example, with ""dax"" consistently corresponding with green and ""bluf"" being followed by ""wif,"" which yields red in multiple instances. ""Bluf"" causes the color, red, in this case, to be repeated.

4. In the fourth example, we see ""dax"" and ""wif"" both repeating their respective colors following ""bluf.""

5. The fifth example does not show direct repetition after ""bluf,"" as the word ""bluf"" is the last in the sequence. However, it can be noted that each previous instance of ""lug"" led to ""blue,"" and here ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue"" again, hinting that ""bluf"" could be mimicking the color of the word before it when it's the last word in a sequence.

Synthesizing these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the next word (or the previous word when ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence). Therefore, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> causes the color of the next word (if it's not the last in the sequence) or the previous word (if it is the last in the sequence) to be repeated.",-0.9173918735853933,153,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's correlate the instances of ""walm"" in the examples with the outputs:

1. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
3. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow""
4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""

Looking at these examples:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is a repetition of yellow (Example 1 & Example 5).
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of green (Example 2 & Example 3).
- When ""walm"" follows a sequence of other words, including ""zup"" or ""dax,"" it seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word before ""walm"" (Example 3 & Example 4).

From the given data, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.12309641211238635,153,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a series of color words being repeated three times. The color that is repeated appears to be associated specifically with the word that directly precedes ""walm."" 

From the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" In this case, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
3. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow."" ""Wif"" comes before ""walm"" here, and the output is ""red"" repeated three times, suggesting that ""wif"" changes the color output associated with ""walm.""
4. In ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" the last word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" and the output includes ""yellow"" repeated three times.
5. ""zup walm lug wif"" once again shows ""zup"" directly before ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times in the output.

Rule:
walm -> Take the word directly preceding ""walm,"" find the corresponding color, and repeat that color three times in the output.",-0.39961964219159096,153,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Here is how the rule applies in each example:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" means yellow and ""walm"" repeats that color thrice.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" means green and ""walm"" repeats that color thrice.
- In the third example, the output ""green red red red blue yellow"" corresponds to the input ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" where ""wif"" appears to mean red, and ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in the color red being repeated three times.
- The fourth example shows that ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which means yellow, so the output is yellow repeated three times after the sequence ""blue green yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again, leading to the repetition of yellow three times after ""blue red,"" which corresponds to ""lug wif.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.5149744548023866,153,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of a color word in the output. The color seems to be determined by the word that appears immediately before ""walm"". Here’s the pattern according to the examples:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup -> yellow)
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" (dax -> green)
- When ""walm"" appears and other words are present, the color word that aligns with ""walm"" still repeats three times, e.g., ""dax wif walm"" includes ""green"" three times in the output sequence.

Additionally, other word-color pairings can be inferred:
- ""wif"" results in the color ""red""
- ""lug"" results in the color ""blue""
- As deduced above ""zup"" results in the color ""yellow""
- ""dax"" results in the color ""green""

The repetition of the color word three times is consistent across the examples whenever ""walm"" is used. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is presented, it results in the word representing the color associated with the preceding word being repeated three times.

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf

5. Input: zup bluf

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the word that precedes it has its color repeated in the output. For example, in the first and fifth examples, ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" makes it repeated, resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second input, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red,"" again with the preceding word's color doubled.
- The third example reinforces the pattern, with ""lug"" translating to ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf"" resulting in ""blue blue.""
- The same happens in the fourth input, where ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output includes ""red red.""

"After examining the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the color ""red."" However, there is a recurring pattern in which the appearance of the word ""bluf"" doubles the output color that comes before it. To demonstrate:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat once.
- In the second example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" translates to ""green blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to repeat once, following the color ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf zup"" corresponds to ""blue blue yellow,"" where ""bluf"" causes ""blue"" to repeat once.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" repeats ""blue"" once and then ""red"" follows, repeating itself.
- In the fifth example, the pattern repeats as in the first one, with ""zup bluf"" corresponding to ""yellow yellow.""

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means to repeat the previous color word in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color word in the output.",-0.10796831377061114,154,bluf

2. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red

5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

It appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. In the first and fifth examples, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats this to give a double ""yellow yellow."" In examples two through four, ""bluf"" follows different patterns:

- ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""
- ""lug"" which is followed by blue, and the output repeats blue.
- ""walm"" followed by ""wif,"" and both are associated with blue or red, so ""bluf"" again repeats these colors.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the examples provided and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax  
   Output: green green green yellow blue green  
   - ""dax"" at the beginning and end corresponds to green.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

2. Input: dax zup dax walm  
   Output: green yellow green green green  
   - ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to green, both times before and after ""zup"" (yellow). 
   - ""walm"" at the end gives us green again.

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm  
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow  
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and appears at the beginning and end.
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow here (in this context, could be because ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup"").
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""walm"" at the end turns into yellow.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm  
   Output: green green green red red red  
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" also turns into red.

5. Input: dax wif walm  
   Output: green red red red  
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" again corresponds to red.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color of the word that comes directly before it. If it's at the beginning of the sequence or after ""dax,"" it corresponds to green. After ""wif,"" it's red. After ""zup,"" it's yellow. There's no example with ""walm"" following ""lug"" to determine its behavior in that context.

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to the color of the preceding word; if it comes after ""dax"" or at the beginning, it defaults to green; if it's after ""wif,"" it corresponds to red; and if it's after ""zup,"" it's yellow.

So, the meaning could be:

Output: green green green yellow blue green

Example 2:
Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

Example 3:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Example 4:
Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

Example 5:
Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Bluf"" seems to correspond to blue, as seen from its single appearance.

Now, analyzing the occurrences of ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs:

- ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and results in a triple green output.
- ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and results in a triple yellow output.
- ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" followed by ""wif"" and results in a triple red output.

"Observing the patterns of input to output and focusing on the placement of ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" results in a repeated color output based on the color output that immediately follows ""walm."" Reviewing the examples:

1. `dax walm zup lug dax` generates `green green green yellow blue green`. The color following ""walm"" is ""green,"" and we see a repetition of ""green"" three times.
   
2. `dax zup dax walm` results in `green yellow green green green`. After ""walm,"" the next word's color is ""green,"" and it repeats three times.

3. `zup bluf lug zup walm` gives `yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow`. ""Yellow"" is the next item following ""walm,"" which then repeats three times.

4. `dax walm wif walm` provides `green green green red red red`. ""Green"" follows the first ""walm"" and repeats twice; the next color for the second ""walm"" is ""red,"" which then repeats three times.

5. `dax wif walm` translates to `green red red red`. After ""walm,"" the color is ""red,"" which repeats three times.

With these observations, the rule can be stated as:

Now, using these rules, we can examine the appearances of ""walm"" to infer its function:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and results in a repetition of green in the output.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" again follows ""dax"" (green), repeating the green in the output.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and there is a repetition of yellow in the output.

- When ""wif bluf dax"" is input, the output is ""red red green.""
- When ""wif zup dax"" is input, the output is ""red yellow green.""
- When ""wif dax wif"" is input, the output is ""red green red.""
- When ""dax lug wif"" is input, the output is ""green blue red.""

By examining the positions where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding colors in the output, the following pattern can be seen:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it comes first and ""red"" when it comes after ""wif.""
- ""Wif"" appears to correspond to ""red"" regardless of where it is in the sequence.
- Other words such as ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively, and seem to be independent of their position with respect to ""wif.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to correlate its presence in the input with the color value in the output. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""zup"" to yellow. Since ""bluf"" also outputs yellow, we can't draw a conclusion from this example alone as both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the same color.

2. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   In this case, ""zup"" matches yellow and ""dax"" matches green. ""bluf"" now matches green, different from the yellow in the first example.

3. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   ""wif"" outputs red, and we already established that ""zup"" outputs yellow. ""lug"" matches with blue, leaving us with ""bluf"" corresponding to red, which is different from the previous conclusions.

4. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
   We know that ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red. The color corresponding to ""bluf"" here is blue, matching with ""lug.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   Knowing ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" corresponds to red once again, aligning with ""wif.""

From these examples, we can deduce a pattern:

- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""dax,"" it outputs green.
- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""zup,"" it outputs yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""wif,"" it outputs red.
- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""lug,"" it outputs blue.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the noun that comes immediately after it. This can be interpreted as ""bluf"" mimicking or reflecting the color associated with the next word. However, when ""bluf"" ends the sentence or there's no known word after it, by default it seems to take the color green, as in the second example.

Rule: bluf -> reflects the color of the following word, or green by default if it is the last word.",-0.08930577690757145,155,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the color outputs following its usage in each input:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
2. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
4. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
5. ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> ""red red green blue""

In input 1 and 2, ""bluf"" is followed by two identical colors: yellow and green, respectively. However, in input 3, 4, and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by two different colors: blue and red.

To find a pattern, consider the positioning of ""bluf"" and the colors that follow it:

- When ""bluf"" is sandwiched between two different words (e.g., ""dax bluf lug""), the output colors are different (green blue).
- When ""bluf"" is sandwiched between two of the same words or follows the same word (e.g., ""wif bluf wif"" or ""wif bluf""), the output colors are the same (red red).

By carefully observing the patterns of the output colors in relation to the words around ""bluf,"" we can infer a rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" generates a color output that matches the color output of the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word is repeated after ""bluf"" (e.g., ""wif bluf wif""), the output color is the same as the input word's associated color (red in the case of ""wif""). If there is a different word following ""bluf,"" the output color changes according to the new word's associated color.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be as follows:

bluf -> the output color is the same as the color mapped to the word directly preceding ""bluf.""",-0.12894994241524677,155,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf seems to change based on the context of the words around it. Given the examples, bluf's meaning appears to correspond to the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. 

Rule: bluf assumes the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it in the list. 

- In ""dax zup bluf,"" dax is green, and zup is yellow, so bluf is yellow because it follows zup.
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" zup is yellow, and dax is green, so bluf is green because it follows dax.
- In ""wif bluf lug zup,"" wif is associated with red, bluf follows wif and turns red, lug is blue, and zup is yellow.
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" lug is associated with blue, so bluf assumes the color blue since it follows lug, and wif is red.
- In ""wif bluf dax lug,"" wif is red, and it precedes bluf, therefore bluf is red; dax is associated with green, and lug is blue.",-0.34600402676272735,155,bluf
"From the examples given, there's a clear pattern that shows the color output is dependent on the position and relation to the word 'bluf'. However, the actual meaning of 'bluf' in relation to the colors is not immediately clear. Instead, the color results seem tied to the position of the other words around 'bluf'. Even though 'bluf' might be central to determining the color outputs, there's not enough consistent information to determine a singular meaning for 'bluf'.

However, let's try to deduce a possible rule:

- In the first two examples, 'dax' corresponds to 'green' when it comes after 'bluf', and 'yellow' when it comes before 'bluf'. Similarly, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' when it comes after 'bluf' and 'green' when before 'bluf'. This could indicate that the position of the words in relation to 'bluf' affects their output color.

- In the third and fourth examples, 'wif' corresponds to 'red' when in proximity to 'bluf', and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' when in proximity to 'bluf'.

- In the fifth example, 'dax' once again corresponds to 'green' when it comes after 'bluf', 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' when it's placed after both 'bluf' and 'dax', and 'wif' immediately before 'bluf' corresponds to 'red'.

Combining this information, it seems that 'bluf' might act as a kind of color-altering agent. Words before 'bluf' are yellow ('zup') or red ('wif'), and words after 'bluf' are green ('dax') or blue ('lug'). However, this rule has exceptions or additional layers we are not privy to with the given examples, as 'wif' followed by 'bluf' without another word in-between doesn't turn the following word, 'lug,' to blue. Additionally, without other words that change to different colors when placed alongside 'bluf', it's difficult to create a comprehensive and consistent rule.

Based on the limited data, the best we can deduce for the rule is as follows:

Rule: The word 'bluf' changes the color associated with the words around it depending on their position relative to 'bluf'. Words before 'bluf' become yellow or red, and words after 'bluf' become green or blue. The actual resulting color seems dependent on the specific word, its position relative to 'bluf', and possibly other contextual rules not evident in the given examples.",-0.6645943182812987,155,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll compare the input with its corresponding output. Let's start by focusing on which parts of the input correspond to particular colors in the output. The aim is to find a pattern that is consistent across all examples.

In the first two examples, ""bluf"" correlates with ""yellow"" when preceeded by ""dax"" or ""zup."" However, when it's surrounded by other words (like ""wif"" or ""lug""), ""bluf"" leads to ""red"" or ""blue,"" respectively. Notably, ""bluf"" is always the second word when it leads to ""red"" or ""blue.""

Since ""bluf"" is associated with different colors based on the context, let's examine each case:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the output is ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup."" It's worth noting that when the positions of ""dax"" and ""zup"" are switched, the colors associated with them also switch. However, ""bluf"" gives ""yellow"" in the first instance and ""green"" in the second, reversing the pattern of the preceding word. This might indicate that ""bluf"" inherits the color of the preceding word but inverts the green and yellow output.

2. For the remaining examples, ""bluf"" is followed by a different word each time:
   - When followed by ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
   - When followed by ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
So, ""bluf"" may take the color of the following word, but it's not clear what happens when the colors are red or blue.

However, the pattern is not entirely consistent because in the third input, despite ""bluf"" being followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""red"" instead of ""blue."" This inconsistency suggests there may be more complex rules at play than initially apparent, or that additional examples would be needed to fully understand the rule governing ""bluf.""

From the limited examples provided, the rule for ""bluf"" may be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning:
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the color associated with ""bluf"" is inverted from ""green"" to ""yellow"" and vice-versa when it is preceded by ""zup.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" or ""wif,"" it may adopt the color of the subsequent word, but additional examples would be required to clarify this pattern due to the inconsistency noted.

Since there's inconsistency and insufficient data, this rule is only a tentative hypothesis and may not be fully accurate. More examples would be needed to determine a more reliable rule for the meaning of ""bluf.""",-0.772236886597143,155,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples given, let's analyze the input in relation to the respective output:

1. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

Here we have ""walm"" preceding two greens. Notice that ""dax"" also gives us a green.

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Here ""walm"" is between two greens, and again, ""dax"" is associated with green, while ""wif"" and ""bluf"" result in red.

3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

Once more, ""walm"" is between green outputs and ""dax"" results in green, ""wif"" in red, and ""zup"" in yellow.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Here ""walm"" comes after a ""wif"" and is followed by ""lug wif"" leading to the output ""red blue red."" ""Wif"" seems to consistently result in red, ""bluf"" in red, ""lug"" in blue, and ""dax"" in green.

5. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

In this case, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""red yellow,"" and is also preceded by a red (""wif"").

Comparing all instances, the presence of ""walm"" results in repeated colors. Specifically, the repeated color appears to be the color that follows the first occurrence of ""walm"". Thus, it appears that ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the color that follows it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the following word to be repeated. 
For example, if ""walm"" is followed by a word that translates to green, ""walm"" will result in the output of additional greens.",-0.05127941707182408,155,walm
"To figure out the rule for ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns associated with its use and the corresponding outputs. Here is a breakdown of the inputs and outputs:

1. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
2. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
4. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
5. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow

Now, let's try to isolate ""walm"" and see if we can deduce its meaning based on the patterns. 

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated. For instance, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" in both the second and third examples. 
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" the color ""red"" is repeated. See the fifth example: ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- ""walm"" also seems to affect the following word unless the following word is ""lug"" or ""zup"", which have consistent colors ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively. For example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" reflects that ""bluf"" and ""wif"" following ""walm"" have their colors (red and blue) unchanged, but when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it affects the output of ""wif"" that follows it.
- It is noted that ""wif"" preceding ""walm"" does not seem to affect ""walm's"" output (since ""wif"" always outputs red and does not appear to have a modifying effect on what follows).

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word preceding it to repeat for the following sequence until the sequence is broken by a word with a fixed color assignment (like ""lug"" for blue and ""zup"" for yellow).

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat until the sequence is interrupted by a word with a fixed color.

For sake of explicit example:
- ""dax walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat.
- ""wif walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat.",-0.07929774745838891,155,walm
"The word ""walm"" seems to correspond with the color green. However, it does not simply translate to one instance of the word green; it means that the green color is to be repeated. The number of repetitions changes based on the examples provided. Specifically, when ""walm"" follows the word ""dax,"" it results in the word green being repeated three times. When ""walm"" follows the word ""wif,"" the word green is repeated twice. The final example shows ""walm"" alone, and it results in the word green being said twice.

Based on the examples:
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" results in only one green after ""dax walm,"" so it seems that ""lug"" might be acting as a terminus to the effect of ""walm"".
- The ""dax walm wif"" sequence consistently leads to a triplet of greens, even when it's followed by different words, like ""bluf"" or ""zup"".
- The ""wif walm"" sequence consistently leads to a double green.
- In the lone case of ""walm"" following two instances of ""wif,"" ""walm"" itself generates a double green, suggesting that the presence of ""wif"" before ""walm"" perhaps primes the output for multiple greens. Another possibility is that single ""walm"" is indicative of two greens and preceding words might affect the number.
- The repeater hypothesis is supported by the fact that ""walm"" never produces a single instance of green; it's always multiple.

So, considering these nuances, here is the most consistent rule that can be derived from the given examples:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color green in the output. The number of repetitions appears to be influenced by the word that precedes ""walm"". If it is ""dax"" then ""walm"" results in three greens, if it is ""wif"" it results in two greens, and if ""walm"" appears alone after ""wif,"" it results in two greens. Additional context is needed to determine the exact rule for ""walm"" when it stands alone or is preceded by words other than ""dax"" or ""wif"".",-0.9829560100371296,155,walm

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the fourth color, ""green,"" in the output.

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first and second ""green"" in the output (since ""walm"" is repeated).

4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

From all the examples presented, we can see that ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green",-0.0631681151527619,156,dax

   - We translate this to blue yellow red blue, which shows that ""wif"" stands between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue), and translates to red.

2. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm""
   - Although ""walm"" isn't directly translated, we can see that ""wif"" is before ""lug"" (blue), translating to red.

3. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug""
   - Similarly, ""wif"" appears before ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue), representing red both times.

4. ""wif lug""
   - ""Wif"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue), which results in red blue.

5. ""zup wif""
   - ""Zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""wif"", translating to yellow red.

From these observations, it's clear that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red, regardless of the words that come before or after it.

"From the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" is paired with a subsequent color word, and in the output, ""red"" is followed by the color that corresponds to that color word (based on the other examples).

"Based on the provided examples, we need to induce what the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to in the output, given its consistent translation across different contexts.

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

Here, ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""lug,"" and ""lug"" is then followed by ""dax."" In the output, ""yellow"" correlates with ""zup,"" ""blue"" with ""bluf,"" and ""green"" with ""dax.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

In this example, ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input and translates to ""green"" in the output. Considering ""green"" corresponds with ""dax,"" it might appear that ""bluf"" takes the same color as the preceding word, which is 'green' in this case.

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green,"" just as in the previous example.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" but translates to ""blue,"" which deviates from the prior pattern if ""bluf"" were solely to replicate the color of the word directly preceding it.

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Here ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" but ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" which again challenges the direct replication idea.

By examining the color associations, it appears ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or neighboring words.

However, this rule is inconsistent with the second input, ""wif dax bluf,"" where ""bluf"" yields ""green"" even though it is not proceeded by ""lug"" or at the end.

Upon re-evaluating the examples with a focus on the position of ""bluf"" relative to other words, a pattern emerges:

1. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue.""
2. It stands that ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when followed by ""dax"" or when it is the last word in the sequence.
3. The second example previously seemed to be an exception. However, if we consider that ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, it correctly translates to ""green.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correspondence between the input and output in each example. We notice that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output has a sequence of the same color repeated. The color precedes the sequence of repeated colors, potentially indicating that the color directly preceding ""walm"" determines the repeated color in the output.

Let's validate this with the examples provided:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""Wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and we see ""red red red"" in the output.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""Dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and we see ""green green green"" in the output.

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Wif"" comes before the first ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red.""
   - ""Zup"" comes before the second ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""Lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and we see ""blue blue blue"" in the output.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""Dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and again we see ""green green green"" in the output.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.09395150896308647,156,walm
"For each example, I will write out the pattern that appears to correspond with the output colors.

4. dax lug walm
   - green blue blue blue

5. dax walm
   - green green green

Observations:
- ""dax"" consistently translates to green.
- ""wif"" ahead of ""walm"" results in red red red.
- ""lug"" in front of ""walm"" results in blue blue blue.
- ""zup"" before ""walm"" results in yellow yellow yellow.

The word ""walm"" seems to replicate the color of the preceding word the number of times corresponding to the number of letters in ""walm."" Since ""walm"" has four letters, it results in four repetitions of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word four times.",-0.1183395329816049,156,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can see that the output color for the word ""walm"" repeats as many times as there are syllables in the previous word. 

Let's consider each instance:

1. In ""wif walm dax,"" the word ""wif"" has one syllable, therefore ""walm"" produces one red output. 
2. In ""dax walm,"" the word ""dax"" has one syllable, thus ""walm"" produces three green outputs, suggesting that the base color for ""walm"" is green, repeating once for the one syllable in ""dax.""
3. In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the word ""wif"" leads to ""walm"" outputting three reds, and the word ""zup"" causes ""walm"" to output three yellows. In both cases, ""wif"" and ""zup"" each have one syllable.
4. In ""dax lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" has one syllable, hence ""walm"" outputs three blues.
5. Again, in ""dax walm,"" repetition occurs from the earlier rule.

Therefore, the rule of ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" outputs a color repeated as many times as there are syllables in the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The color itself is chosen based on some other factor not explicitly provided (perhaps the first consonant of the previous word, order of appearance, or some other rule).

In summary:

2. ""dax walm zup lug"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue."" Here, ""dax"" is followed by different words but the output always starts with ""green.""

- 'lug' is the only new word, and it correlates with 'blue'.

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- 'wif' correlates with 'red' again.

This repeat effect is not seen when 'wif' stands alone or is the first word.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red, and it also duplicates the subsequent color in the output.

Examples supporting this rule:
- ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green"" because 'wif' corresponds to ""red"" and seems to also duplicate the color that corresponds to 'bluf' (which is ""red"").
- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"" because 'lug' corresponds to ""blue"", 'wif' corresponds to ""red"" and the rule dictates that the next color (in this case, 'walm' corresponding to ""green"") should be duplicated; however, since 'walm' is the last word, 'wif' might change 'walm' to ""red"" multiplying its impact.",-1.013171253062666,157,wif

Again ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow."" This aligns with our hypothesis.

4. ""zup lug dax lug"" outputs ""yellow blue green blue""
""dax"" is a new word here, but ""lug"" remains consistent with ""blue."" Given ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and nothing contradicts our hypothesis, ""zup"" seems to remain ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" likely translates to ""green.""

5. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" and ""lug"" together result in ""blue blue,"" which appears consistent as ""walm"" followed by ""lug"" again results in ""blue yellow."" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and knowing ""zup"" potentially means ""yellow,"" this example still aligns with our hypothesis.

- After the initial appearance of zup, all subsequent colors until a new color word appears are yellow.
- This rule resets upon encountering a new color word (e.g., lug, wif, dax) which is then translated to its respective color.

- In example 4, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", which is not consistent with the previous findings since ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"".

"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that 'walm' takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If we examine the outputs, 'walm' generates repeated color outputs that match the color associated with the word right before it. Let's break down the examples:

1. In ""zup lug walm"", 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow, and 'lug' to blue. 'walm' follows 'lug' and therefore repeats the color blue multiple times: Output: yellow blue blue blue.

2. In ""zup walm"", 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and 'walm' follows 'zup', so 'walm' repeats the color yellow for the following outputs: Output: yellow yellow yellow.

3. In ""lug walm zup"", 'lug' corresponds to blue and is followed by 'walm', so 'walm' repeats the color blue. However, 'zup' is after 'walm', therefore it is 'zup' that changes the color sequence: Output: blue blue blue yellow.

4. Again, in ""zup walm"", the pattern holds true with 'zup' producing yellow and 'walm' repeating it: Output: yellow yellow yellow.

5. In ""dax walm lug"", 'dax' corresponds to green, followed by 'walm' which repeats the color green, and then 'lug' changes the color to blue: Output: green green green blue.

So, the rule for 'walm' is that it repeats the color of the word that is immediately before it multiple times, generally three times based on the examples provided.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.08747834146,157,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be an instruction to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here’s how the rule applies to each example:

1. ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" means to repeat ""blue"" three times.
  
2. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" since ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""walm"" means to repeat ""yellow"" three times.

3. ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow"" with ""lug"" being ""blue,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, and then it's followed by ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

4. ""zup walm"" again gives us ""yellow yellow yellow"" for the same reason as the second example.

5. ""dax walm lug"" turns into ""green green green blue"" where ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

Taking these observations into account, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.11654075355820004,157,walm
"Based on the examples provided where ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" it is possible to deduce that ""walm"" in the context of these examples is a rule that means to repeat the color of the word it follows multiple times. 

The number of repetitions appears to be equal to the number of letters in the English color word that corresponds to the color given by the preceding word. For instance, in ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" which has six letters in English, and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times. In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" which has four letters in English, hence the output is ""blue"" repeated four times. In ""dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" which has five letters in English, so the output is ""green"" repeated three times followed by ""blue"" (from the word ""lug"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word. The number of repetitions is equal to half the number of letters in the name of that color (rounded down if necessary).",-0.6690520904999998,157,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following:

- When walm follows zup, the output is three instances of the color corresponding to zup, which is yellow.
- When walm follows lug, the output is three instances of the color corresponding to lug, which is blue.
- When walm follows dax, the output is three instances of the color corresponding to dax, which is green.

It seems that walm causes repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it, and this repetition occurs three times.

Rule: walm -> causes three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.7544285413471431,157,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color word that precedes it. Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.",-1.298830536187143,157,walm
"By analyzing the given examples and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""lug.""

From the first input ""wif lug dax walm"" and output ""red blue green green green,"" we can see that ""lug"" precedes a sequence of ""green.""

Looking at the second input ""lug walm"" and output ""blue blue blue,"" it looks like ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue.""

The third input ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" and the output ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"" show that after the word ""lug,"" the colors switch to a pattern that starts with ""blue.""

The fourth input ""dax walm zup lug dax"" and the output ""green green green yellow blue green"" confirm this, where ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" and the previous color pattern is interrupted.

The last input ""lug wif bluf"" and output ""blue red red"" show again that ""lug"" stands for ""blue,"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule:
- ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue.""
- ""lug"" may also affect the subsequent pattern, notably switching the first color after ""lug"" to ""blue,"" although more examples might be necessary to confirm the exact nature of this effect.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue",-0.06123130467114607,158,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the rule for the meaning of ""lug"". Let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

1. ""wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""red blue green green green""

5. ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" does not have a direct correspondence, but based on the pattern, ""bluf"" seems to continue repeating the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red""

From these examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" and does not change its meaning based on position or the presence of other words.

- ""dax"" (one syllable) translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" (one syllable) translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" (one syllable) translates to ""yellow""

5. ""walm"" appears always to repeat the word that comes immediately before it three times.

Examples to justify rule 5:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" repeats ""lug"" (blue) three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" is still translated as ""blue blue blue"", and when ""lug walm"" is repeated with an intermittent ""zup lug"", it results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"", with ""walm"" again repeating the color word (blue) three times before and after ""zup"" which is yellow.
- The third example shows ""zup walm"" as ""yellow yellow yellow"", where ""walm"" repeats ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue"", with ""walm"" repeating ""lug"" (blue) three times.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue"", so ""walm"" repeats ""wif"" (red) three times, and at the end ""lug"" is just translated as ""blue"" without a ""walm"" after it to trigger repetition.

   ""bluf"" in the second position corresponds to ""blue"" in the second position of the output.

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug

3. wif walm -> red red red
4. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red

Now, let's look for patterns:

- In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""walm"" appears at the end of the input, and the output repeats the color that should be associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" is not at the end, but is followed by ""wif"" which is translated as ""red."" The color green, which precedes ""walm,"" is repeated thrice before the red, which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" appears twice, and each time, it causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated. ""zup lug walm"" results in yellow followed by blue repeated twice, and ""wif walm"" results in red repeated twice.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the word before ""walm"" should be repeated twice, and if ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, the color is repeated three times.

Input: zup bluf wif walm

Here, 'walm' follows 'wif', and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'. The output for 'walm' is 'red red red'.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
Here, 'walm' is preceded by 'dax', which corresponds to 'green'. The output for 'walm' in this example is 'green green green'.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: zup lug walm wif walm

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Similarly, 'walm' follows 'dax', which corresponds to 'green', and its output is 'green green green'.

Based on these examples, the pattern that emerges is that 'walm' repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it three times.

2. In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, immediately followed by ""walm,"" yielding ""green green green,"" and then ""wif"" on its own is ""red.""

4. With ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, with ""walm"" following for ""blue blue blue,"" then ""wif"" for red, and another ""walm"" to repeat red three times.
5. Finally, ""dax walm"" simply repeats the green color associated with ""dax"" three times due to ""walm.""

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the appearance of the word ""walm"" is always followed by the word ""red"" repeated a number of times. The number of repetitions of ""red"" corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned in the input.

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" but is not repeated unless followed by ""walm""

2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red

The rule seems to depend on the word or position before ""wif"". In examples where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", ""wif"" leads to the output ""red"". But when ""wif"" comes after ""zup"", it results in ""red"" as well, whereas after ""dax"" it leads to ""green"". So, we can infer that ""wif"" changes the color based on the previous word.

Let's attempt to break it down:

1. After ""dax"" (green) -> ""wif"" gives green.
2. After ""zup"" (yellow) -> ""wif"" gives red.
3. Standing alone before ""bluf"" -> ""wif"" gives red.
4. After ""lug"" (blue) -> ""wif"" gives red.
5. Following the pattern with ""zup"" and ""dax"" -> ""wif"" gives red and green, respectively.

Based on these examples, ""wif"" could mean ""change to the next color in a predefined sequence or based on specific rules of transition between colors"", but it's not entirely consistent. There seems to be a pattern of ""wif"" following a color word and changing the color output in a way that is not purely sequential (since ""lug"" does not precede ""wif"" with blue again).

Rule: ""wif"" changes the output color based on the previous word according to a set of transition rules: 

- After ""dax"" (green), ""wif"" results in green.
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""wif"" results in red.
- When preceding ""bluf"" or following ""lug"" (blue), ""wif"" results in red, regardless of the preceding color.

- In the second example, ""wif"" by itself is followed by ""yellow red,"" indicating that ""wif"" might be associated with the color yellow or changes the next color to red.
- In the third example, the presence of ""wif"" before ""bluf"" changes the output to ""red red,"" supporting the idea that ""wif"" changes the following word's color to red.
- In the fourth example, the sequence ""lug wif bluf"" leads to ""blue red red,"" again indicating that the word ""bluf"" after ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""red green,"" then ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""red red"" once more.

1. In every output where ""wif"" is mentioned, there is a red immediately following it.
2. In every example, ""wif"" is followed by another word, and in the output, ""red"" is followed by a color that is not red (except for the last example, but the presence of another ""wif"" provides a red).
3. The word following ""wif"" determines the second color in the output: ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" and no other words follow ""wif"" directly other than these two examples.
4. Colors in the output don't seem to correspond directly to the words before ""wif,"" suggesting that ""wif"" doesn't translate into a static color but may influence the color corresponding to the word following it.

1. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

3. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: red red yellow yellow red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""

5. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and the result is ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif."" In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and the result is ""blue,"" which is associated with ""lug."" However, in the second and third examples, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and results in ""yellow,"" suggesting a possible inconsistency.

To propose a consistent rule, let's consider if there's a pattern that could explain the difference in the second and third examples:

In each case, ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by a different word (""zup"" in the second example, ""wif"" in the third). Perhaps ""bluf"" doubles the color that would be produced by the word immediately preceding it. Let's see if this applies:

1. The ""wif"" before ""bluf"" leads to ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" also leads to ""red.""
2. The ""zup"" before ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" also leads to ""yellow.""
3. The ""wif"" before ""bluf"" leads to ""red,"" and then the second ""bluf"" also leads to ""yellow,"" which is different from what we would expect if the rule were simply repeating the previous color. However, since there is a pattern where ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow"" specifically after ""zup,"" it might be an exception.
4. & 5. The ""lug"" before ""bluf"" leads to ""blue,"" and then ""bluf"" also leads to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule might be as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the word immediately before it, except when followed by ""wif"" after ""zup,"" where ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow.""

Given the available examples and the inconsistency observed, this rule seems to fit the data we have, but more examples would be needed to confirm, especially to understand why ""bluf"" sometimes outputs ""yellow.""

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine each input and its corresponding output one by one, paying attention to the patterns that emerge associated with ""bluf.""

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and outputs ""red"" before ""yellow.""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and outputs ""yellow"" before ""red.""

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red
- ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" respectively, which corresponds to ""yellow"" after ""red."" The second ""bluf"" also shows the same pattern, with ""yellow"" following it.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and outputs ""blue"" before ""red.""

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and outputs ""blue"" before ""red.""

From the outputs, we can see that whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, the output color corresponding to ""bluf"" is the same as the word that came right before ""bluf."" Subsequent colors depend on the word following ""bluf,"" but ""bluf"" itself assumes the color of the preceding word. This pattern holds in each example provided.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" correlates to the output color of the word immediately before it, repeating the same color.

bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the output color of the preceding word.",-0.08399277691666664,161,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue

This conclusion is based on the patterns seen in the examples. Specifically:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and produces ""red red yellow"". Since ""wif"" always maps to ""red"", the color associated with ""bluf"" can be inferred to be ""blue"" based on the ""blue blue red"" pattern in the last input where no ""zup"" is present to alter the sequence.
  
- We can see that every time ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""blue"".

- Additionally, in the fourth input, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the sequence contains ""lug"" and ""wif"" multiple times, both of which can be reliably mapped to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively. When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output color is also ""blue,"" further confirming the pattern.

Hence, based on the given examples, ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue.""",-1.0376468396151854,161,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word bluf corresponds to the color associated with the word preceding it. Each time ""bluf"" follows another word, the color outputted is the same as the color outputted for the word right before ""bluf"".

- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", and both output ""yellow"".

"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

Example 1: ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"". Here, 'dax' corresponds to ""green"" and 'lug' corresponds to ""blue"". 'Walm' produces ""blue blue"".

Example 2: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". From this, 'lug' is ""blue"", 'bluf' is ""blue"", and 'wif' is ""red"". 'Walm' between 'wif' and 'lug' produces ""red red red"", suggesting that 'walm' repeats the color of the word before it multiple times.

Example 3: ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". Since 'wif' is ""red"", 'walm' repeats the color ""red"" twice more.

Example 4: ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". Here, 'dax' is ""green"", 'lug' is ""blue"", 'zup' is ""yellow"", and 'wif' is ""red"". 'Walm' is inserted after 'lug' and before 'zup', which resulted in two additional instances of ""blue"".

Example 5: ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow"". 'Wif' corresponds to ""red"", 'zup' to ""yellow"", and 'walm' follows 'wif', again repeating ""red"" twice.

Considering all examples, it seems that 'walm' repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it two additional times. If this pattern holds true, 'walm' acts as an instruction to replicate the color associated with the previous word two more times.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""dax"" is green and ""lug"" is blue. ""walm"" in this context implies repeating blue three times.

2. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" where ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""lug"" is blue again. In this context, ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to repeating red three times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" gave us ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" was the last word before ""walm,"" and ""blue"" was repeated three times.
  
- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the output ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"" featured ""red"" repeated three times immediately after ""walm"" which follows ""wif"" that translates to ""red.""

- The third example, ""wif walm,"" directly yielded ""red red red,"" showing that ""walm"" once again caused the repetition of the last color, which is ""red"" from ""wif.""
  
- The fourth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" demonstrated that ""walm"" repeats the color from ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" three times before moving on to the next color translations for ""zup"" and ""wif.""

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
4. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
5. When ""walm"" appears, it generates a sequence of ""red"" outputs, with the number of reds depending on a certain condition.

Considering these associations, we can look at the presence of ""wif"" and ""walm"" in the examples:

- Input: ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"". Here, ""wif"" alone corresponds to a single ""red"", but the presence of ""walm"" yields a triple ""red"". There is no other word between ""wif"" and ""walm"".

- Input: ""wif walm zup"" includes an additional word ""zup"" following ""wif walm"", but the sequence of ""red red red"" is unchanged before ""yellow"" is output for ""zup"".

Given that ""walm"" consistently generates a sequence of ""red"" without any clear dependence on surrounding words, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""red"" irrespective of its position or the presence of other words.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color red three times in the sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to be a rule for repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it a specific number of times. The number of repetitions for the corresponding color seems to be determined by the number of words that have appeared in the input sequence so far. The color mapping of words to colors seems consistent; for instance, ""lug"" maps to blue, ""zup"" maps to yellow, ""wif"" maps to red, and ""dax"" maps to green.

Analyzing the examples:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and since ""lug"" is the first word, ""walm"" repeats the color 3 times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""zup"" is the first word, so ""walm"" repeats yellow 3 times.
- ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and it is the second word in the sequence, therefore ""walm"" repeats blue 4 times (given that ""wif"" is first and maps to red, this would imply that red is not affected by the ""walm"" rule in this specific case).
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and it is the fourth word, hence ""walm"" repeats yellow 6 times (because there are five words before ""walm,"" but ""walm"" itself counts as the sixth in the sequence).
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" ""Zup"" is the third word before ""walm"" so its corresponding color yellow is repeated 6 times (as it's the sixth word) before continuation with the colors green and red, which seem unaffected by the ""walm"" rule in this context.

Taking these observations into account, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word a number of times equal to the position in the word sequence at which ""walm"" appears.

It is to be noted, however, that if words after ""walm"" are present, the repetition does not extend past ""walm"" and any further color mappings from words like ""dax"" and ""wif"" following ""walm"" are treated normally.",-0.1670037500019541,162,walm

"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" and any other words it is used with by comparing the inputs with their respective outputs.

Let's break down each example:

1. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

2. Input: wif
   Output: red

3. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red

4. Input: wif
   Output: red

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

From examples 1 and 3, it appears that the combination ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green"". When ""wif"" is used alone, as seen in examples 2 and 4, it translates to ""red"". In example 3, the sequence ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"", which is also the case in example 5.

Based on this pattern, we can infer the following:

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""dax"" following ""wif"" changes the next color to ""green""
- ""lug"" following ""wif"" changes the next color to ""blue""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" represents the color ""red"" and alters the color that follows it if additional words such as ""dax"" or ""lug"" are present. ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when they follow ""wif"".

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"".

Additionally, following this rule:
- ""dax"" when it comes after ""wif"" -> ""green""
- ""lug"" when it comes after ""wif"" -> ""blue""",-0.15602461636738335,163,wif

- The presence of the word ""wif"" on its own results in the output ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue.""
- The sequences where ""wif"" appears multiple times, each instance of ""wif"" is followed by its corresponding color output, maintaining the order presented in the simple two-word examples.

From these patterns, it can be deduced that ""wif"" indicates the color ""red,"" and it also functions as a separator between other color-indicating words like ""dax"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

"Rule:
To determine the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze its usage and pattern within various example inputs and their corresponding outputs. Across all examples, one can observe that the outputs are names of colors which correspond to the words preceding and succeeding ""bluf.""

Let's consider the examples one by one:

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
Here, ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds with ""yellow."" This could indicate ""bluf"" takes on the color preceding it, which would be ""red"" in this case.

2. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
This example follows the same logic as the first, suggesting that ""bluf"" again takes the color of the word just before it, ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

3. wif bluf -> red red
Again, this correlation supports the rule of ""bluf"" taking the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

4. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
In this more extended sequence, ""bluf"" first follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and then later it follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Each time, ""bluf"" matches the color of the preceding word as per the pattern we are deducing.

5. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" reiterating the established pattern.

Synthesizing the information from these examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.

Therefore, the deduced rule is:
bluf -> takes the color of the previous word",-0.08129204201730611,163,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" and to the color ""blue"" when it follows ""lug."" However, ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" and there is no direct translation for ""zup"" followed by ""bluf""; ""zup bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the first instance and ""yellow red"" in the second.

Let's examine the instances:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf,"" following ""wif,"" gives us ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, we also get ""green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times. ""Zup"" at the beginning and the end corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" also results in ""blue;"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and the color ""yellow"" appears again.

From these examples, there appears to be a direct relationship between the color that ""bluf"" translates to and the word that precedes ""bluf."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word preceding it, with some exceptions, such as following ""zup.""

Thus, the resulting rule is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning follows the color of the word before ""bluf,"" with an exception for ""zup"" which leads to varied results (as seen in the provided examples, ""yellow"" and ""yellow red"").",-0.8674673558372447,163,bluf
"To decipher the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the examples provided.

1. When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
3. When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
4. When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""

Now let's examine how ""bluf"" behaves in the context of these known words:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and the corresponding output is ""red yellow."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" we can deduce that ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" in this example.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green."" Here, ""dax"" is known to correspond to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" must also correspond to ""green"" in this context.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red."" As ""wif"" is known to correspond to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also outputs ""red"" here.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" with the corresponding output ""blue blue yellow."" ""Lug"" is known to be ""blue,"" hence ""bluf"" is ""blue"" as well, and ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""dax,"" with the output ""blue blue green."" Similar to the fourth example, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" here also produces ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

From these patterns, we can induce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color output of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word or the preceding word doesn't have an attributed color, the default color for ""bluf"" is not given in the examples.",-1.0561331537736731,163,bluf
"Inspecting the patterns between the inputs and outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""bluf.""

In all instances where ""bluf"" appears, it precedes a color that has already appeared directly before it. Observing the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word.

For example:
- In the first input, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red.""
- In the second input, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
- In the third input, ""wif bluf"" again translates to ""red red.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug bluf"" and then again ""zup bluf"" translate respectively to ""blue blue"" and ""yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue.""

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.",-1.1009239647500002,163,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color represented by the word directly preceding it. That is, ""bluf"" takes the color value of the preceding word.

Therefore, the rule can be written as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-1.8289689195857135,163,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs. Let's analyze each input-output pair and look for occurrences of ""walm.""

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" does not appear in other examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to two ""yellow"" before ""walm.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""yellow.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" with ""walm"" occurring after these.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Observations:
1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, it results in repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
2. ""walm"" has followed different words (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif""), and in each case, it repeats the color output of the word before it.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it, specifically repeating the color three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it three times.",-0.06600416916682794,163,walm
"Based on the input and output examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the corresponding outputs.

Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is between two ""green"" words, we can infer that it also translates to ""green.""

2. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf"" are easily identifiable, matching ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and given that ""walm"" and ""lug"" result in ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" we can infer again that ""walm"" must equal ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" is known to correspond to ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" in the output, it seems to be contributing to the yellow output as well.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. Since the output associated with ""walm"" in this case is ""blue blue blue,"" following a ""lug"" (which is ""blue""), it indicates that ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and since ""walm"" results in two additional ""red"" in the output, it seems to be contributing to the red output as well.

From the above, we can discern that ""walm"" seems to multiply the color output of the word it follows by three. However, this rule doesn't apply uniformly, as seen in the second example. Therefore, a better interpretation of the evidence could be that ""walm"" results in a triplication of the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""walm"" makes it ""green green green.""
- In example 2, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" makes it ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In examples 4 and 5, ""wif"" is ""red,"" so ""walm"" after ""wif"" makes it ""red red red.""
- The second instance of ""walm"" in example 4 follows ""lug"" (""blue"") and results in ""blue blue blue.""

However, this rule does not explain why ""walm"" is different colors in the first and second examples, leading to a potential contradiction. Given this, it is likely that ""walm"" takes on the meaning of the color word it directly follows and repeats the corresponding color output three times.

2. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" gives us ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""

"Wif -> triggers a color switch according to a pattern. Rule:

Observing the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to cause a change in the color that follows the sequence of words before it. Let's break down each example:

2. lug walm wif lug bluf

It's always possible that with more examples, a more complex rule could be discerned, but based on these, the pattern above seems to hold true.

Rule: wif -> changes the next color in the sequence to red.",-0.21606100253628094,164,wif
"Rule: ""wif"" changes the color sequence to the next color and adds red.

Examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Explanation: dax and walm both translate to green. When ""wif"" appears, the sequence changes by adding red.

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Explanation: lug and walm translate to blue. When ""wif"" appears, the next color in the sequence changes, and red is added.

3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   Explanation: zup, walm, and lug translate to yellow, yellow, and blue respectively. When ""wif"" appears, it disrupts this sequence with red.

4. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red
   Explanation: zup and dax translate to yellow and green. ""Wif"" then adds red to the sequence.

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Explanation: lug translates to blue. The appearance of ""wif"" causes a shift, adding red and continuing with the colors corresponding to the subsequent inputs.

3. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow

Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example, the word ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
  - Since ""bluf"" is in the middle and the output is ""red red green,"" this suggests that ""bluf"" may assume the color preceding it, meaning ""bluf"" would be ""red"" in this context.

- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds again with ""red.""
  - Here ""bluf"" is at the end, and the output is ""blue red blue blue,"" once again suggesting that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word right before it, which would be ""blue.""

- The third example shows ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""
  - With ""bluf"" at the end and the output being ""yellow blue blue,"" it further supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word, hence ""blue"" here.

- The fourth example again shows ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""dax"" as ""green.""
  - With ""bluf"" at the end and the output is ""blue green green,"" this reinforces that ""bluf"" matches the color of the word before it, ""green"" in this case.

- The fifth example has ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""lug"" as ""blue,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""
  - With ""bluf"" at the end and the output being ""red blue yellow yellow,"" it further substantiates that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, making ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow"" here.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the word preceding it in the input sequence.

"The examples given demonstrate that the output color corresponding to the nonce word ""bluf"" matches the color that was associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the input.

Let's look at the provided examples briefly:

- wif bluf dax -> red red green
- lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
- zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
- lug dax bluf -> blue green green
- wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow

In each instance, the color for ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that is ascribed to the word before it:

- In the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" immediately follows, so ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" turns into ""blue blue,"" showing that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"" which is blue.
- In the third, ""lug"" is blue and is followed by ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" is again blue.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is green before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" is also green.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup"" is yellow and precedes ""bluf,"" hence ""bluf"" translates to yellow.

Thus, the general rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it.

3. Input: zup lug bluf; Output: yellow blue blue
4. Input: lug dax bluf; Output: blue green green
5. Input: wif lug zup bluf; Output: red blue yellow yellow

From these examples, we observe that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Also, notice that the color that comes after ""bluf"" is a repeat of the color that came directly before it.

Examining each instance of ""bluf"":
1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the color before ""bluf"" is ""red,"" so after ""bluf,"" ""green"" becomes ""red.""
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""blue"" is repeated, which aligns with ""lug"" before ""bluf.""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so after ""bluf,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated.
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and it is repeated after ""bluf.""
5. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is repeated after ""bluf.""

Input: zup bluf

Input: zup bluf dax

Let's examine the outputs whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". This happened twice, suggesting consistency.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", with ""wif"" coming before ""dax"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" is the final word in the series, even if ""dax"" comes before it, the output is simply a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"".
- In a longer sequence, ""bluf"" leads to the output ""red"", when it is preceded by both ""wif"" and ""dax"". But when ""dax"" appears after ""bluf"", the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) follows.

From these observations, we might infer:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color output of the word before it. However, when ""bluf"" is preceded by both ""wif"" and ""dax"" specifically, it seems to output ""red"". Without more context, this pattern is somewhat ambiguous, as there is only one instance of ""bluf"" following both ""wif"" and ""dax"". To confirm the rule for ""bluf"", more examples would be helpful, especially ones that further clarify its relationship with ""wif"" and ""dax"" together.

Given the examples, a tentative rule could be: bluf -> repeat the preceding color, with a possible exception or special rule when preceded by ""wif dax"".",-0.09672609103274998,165,bluf
"From the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the input. When we have the word ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"". In other cases, ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that comes immediately before it.

Here is how the rule plays out:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   (The word before ""bluf"" was ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", thus ""bluf"" also means ""yellow"".)

2. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   (The word before ""bluf"" was ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", thus ""bluf"" also means ""green"".)

3. Input: zup bluf dax

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax

Examples to support the rule:
- In ""zup bluf"", zup is associated with yellow, so bluf also becomes yellow.
- In ""wif dax bluf"", dax is associated with green, so bluf also becomes green.
- In ""zup bluf dax"", zup is yellow and dax is green, but since bluf follows zup, it takes the color yellow, and dax remains green.

Let's review the examples:

- ""dax walm wif walm"" yields ""green green green red red red"", where ""green"" corresponds to ""dax"", and ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"". Both colors are tripled due to the presence of ""walm"" after each.

- ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red"", where ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup"" and ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"" again, tripled because of ""walm"".

- ""lug dax walm"" yields ""blue green green green"", where ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"" and ""green"" corresponds to ""dax"", which is tripled due to ""walm"".

- ""zup wif walm"" is provided twice and consistently yields ""yellow red red red,"" adhering to the same pattern as outlined above.

- ""wif dax zup walm"" yields ""red green yellow yellow yellow"", where the pattern continues except that ""walm"" comes at the end, tripling only the output corresponding to ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

1. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", with ""walm"" duplicating the preceding color three times.

2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
   
   Example: ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
   
3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

4.

We'll assume it's due to ""lug,"" and then ""walm"" adds ""green green green"" as in the first pattern after ""dax.""

The pattern that emerges is that the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color produced before it, three times. The color that's repeated seems to depend on the word that directly precedes ""walm.""

Each example leads to a repetition in the output sequence, and this repetition is associated with the color that appears just before ""walm"" in the input sequence. Also, the number of times the color is repeated in the output seems to depend on the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. Specifically:

- In the first input sequence, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" and since ""walm"" is the fourth word, ""red"" is repeated three times after the initial color associated with ""wif.""
- In the second input sequence, there are two words before ""walm,"" and ""wif"" (which outputs ""red"") appears just before ""walm,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.
- In the third input sequence, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output. There are three words in the input, so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- The fourth input sequence is identical to the second one and yields the same output pattern.
- In the fifth input sequence, there are four words before ""walm,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" which is repeated four times after the initial sequence.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- The word dax corresponds to green and wif corresponds to red.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug

- Here, dax still corresponds to green. The new word zup corresponds to yellow, lug corresponds to blue, and wif still corresponds to red.

Input: dax zup dax zup
Output: green yellow green yellow
- The word dax corresponds to green and zup still corresponds to yellow, reaffirming our previous findings.

Input: dax
Output: green
- When dax is on its own, the output is simply green, reaffirming that dax corresponds to green.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- dax corresponds to green at the beginning and the end. Wif still corresponds to red. It's not clear what walm means from this example alone. However, it seems like walm might result in the repetition of the previous color, which in this case is green.

From these observations, it is clear that dax corresponds to the color green, regardless of the context it is used in. Other words in the input correspond to other colors, and the pattern of colors corresponds to the order of words.

3. Input: dax zup dax zup — Output: green yellow green yellow
4. Input: dax — Output: green
5. Input: dax walm wif dax — Output: green green green red green

Based on the outputs, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. Thus, a direct association can be made between ""dax"" and the color ""green."" There does not appear to be any different context or condition under which ""dax"" changes meaning; it is consistently mapped to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. It is also the first color mentioned in every output sequence, which suggests that ""dax"" is not influenced by other words but is a standalone mapping.

This suggests a simple rule where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Furthermore, when we have multiple occurrences of ""dax"" in an input, each ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the words that come between:

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

Input: dax zup dax zup

"To understand the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs.

First observation:
- Input: wif zup
- Output: red yellow

In this instance, ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow."" There is no context other than the single occurrence of each, so we infer ""zup"" to mean ""yellow.""

However, let's consider more examples to see if this holds.

Second observation from additional examples:
- Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
- Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Third observation:
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
- Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Once again, ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

Rule:

Meaning:
zup means ""yellow.""",-0.4497148575068544,166,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns and appearances of other words and corresponding colors in the examples:

1. When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
3. When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
4. When ""walm"" appears, the output is not given directly, but it follows the pattern that ""walm"" generates an extra ""red"" before the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence (e.g., ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" produces ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"" where the extra reds come before each appearance of ""zup"" and ""lug"" following a ""walm"").

Now, looking at ""zup"":
- When ""zup"" appears by itself with ""wif,"" it produces ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow green.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow green green green.""

The rule in every instance of ""zup"" is that the output always starts with ""yellow,"" regardless of the words that follow. So it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and it is followed by the color corresponding to the word that comes after ""zup"" (if there is one).

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-0.8487143682187382,166,zup
"By examining the examples provided, we can identify patterns for the words wif, lug, dax, and walm as well as their corresponding outputs. Let's look at each case:

- Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the repetition of the previous color occurs in the output.

In each of the examples, ""zup"" appears in the input and the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. There are no examples where ""zup"" appears and ""yellow"" is not in the corresponding output. With the information provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the appearance of other words we've defined relationships for.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

zup -> ""yellow""

1. Every time ""zup"" is used, it translates to ""yellow.""
2. ""Zup"" is independent of its position within the sequence (it can appear at the beginning, middle, or end).
3. The surrounding words do not seem to affect the translation of ""zup"" itself; it consistently maps to the same output regardless of adjacent words.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be straightforward based on the provided examples:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples provided:

- ""zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
- ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""
- ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green""
- ""lug wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue blue""

Based on the provided data:

- Whenever we see ""bluf"" at the end of a sequence, the output is the color before it, repeated once.
- If ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" could mean to repeat the previous color mentioned.
- In the longest provided sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" with the output being ""green red."" This is a deviation since it's not just ""green"" repeated.
- The preceding rule is somewhat contradicted by the ""wif bluf dax"" example, where the output for ""bluf dax"" is ""red green,"" breaking the pattern of ""bluf"" causing a repeat of the previous color.

Given this information, a potential rule for ""bluf"" is that it typically signifies a repetition of the previous color word in the sequence. However, there’s an irregularity in the sequence involving ""dax,"" which suggests that either ""dax"" influences ""bluf"" in an unconventional manner or there may be an error in the input-output relationship.

Based on the majority of consistent observations, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color mentioned in the sequence (with the possible exception of ""dax"" influencing this rule).",-0.11130403319757316,166,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, let's determine what ""bluf"" means.

Input: zup lug bluf -> Output: yellow blue blue

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue

Looking at the above inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" with the second ""blue"". 
- In the second, ""wif"" corresponds with both ""red"" outputs, and the presence of ""bluf"" doesn't affect the color that ""wif"" maps to.
- In the third, not only do the colors precede their respective nonce words, but ""bluf"" occurs twice and each time is associated with the color directly preceding it (""green"" and ""yellow""). 
- In the fourth, we see ""bluf"" occur between two already determined colors: red and green. Since it's output as ""red"" again, we can infer that ""bluf"" represents the color that is mentioned just before it.
- In the fifth, ""bluf"" is at the end after two ""lug"" which correlates to ""blue"" and produces another ""blue.""

From these observations, we can determine that ""bluf"" represents the color of the word that directly precedes it. Thus, ""bluf"" repeats the color indicated by the previous word.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

- In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and there are three letters in ""wif"". Therefore, ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times. ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow"", hence ""green yellow"".
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and there are three letters in ""lug"". Consequently, ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

5. ""zup walm lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". 'Walm' follows 'zup' (yellow) resulting in three 'yellow' before 'lug' translates to 'blue'.

From these examples, we can infer the following rule:

In the first input, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif dax walm"" and the output is ""yellow red green green green."" This suggests that ""zup"" could translate to ""yellow,"" but we need more evidence.

Looking at the second input, ""dax bluf wif zup,"" the output is ""green green red yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is at the end, and the corresponding output ends with ""yellow,"" giving further credence to ""zup"" meaning ""yellow.""

In the third input, ""zup wif lug wif,"" the output is ""yellow red blue red."" The first word of the output is ""yellow,"" matching the position of ""zup"" in the input.

In the fourth input, ""wif zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""red yellow green green."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" the output is ""yellow blue red green green red,"" and ""zup"" is the first word, which is aligned with ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on these observations across all the examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-0.06262022979568084,168,zup

Output: yellow red green green green

Input: dax bluf wif zup

Input: zup wif lug wif
Output: yellow red blue red

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

From the examples provided, we can observe the following:

1. ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow.""
2. ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""
3. ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""
4. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the examples where it appears.
5. ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" when in the sequence, and the colors follow the same pattern as words appearing in the output.
6. ""walm"" doesn't have a clear, one-to-one corresponding color since it appears once, but it does translate to ""green"" in its single occurrence, maintaining the pattern.

Based on the patterns above, we can deduce the rule underlying the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.06391717582781171,168,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and output in each example:

   Output: yellow red green green green

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow

3. Input: zup wif lug wif
   Output: yellow red blue red

4. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red

Looking closely at these examples, we can observe that:
- Every time ""zup"" appears, the first color in the output is ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the contexts given.
- The word ""bluf"" also consistently correlates with the color ""green.""

Given these observations, the rules seem to indicate that each word translates to a specific color. Therefore, the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" every time it appears in the input, irrespective of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.06514834624515957,168,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we will compare the inputs and outputs to find the corresponding color for ""zup"".

From the examples:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
2. Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow
3. Input: zup wif lug wif -> Output: yellow red blue red
4. Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red

In all instances where ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""yellow"". Now, examining whether other words correspond to other colors.

Let's do a quick analysis for each of the other words:

- wif: Always corresponds to the color red.
- dax: Always corresponds to the color green.
- walm: Seems to correspond to the color green. Appears once.
- bluf: Always corresponds to the color green.
- lug: Always corresponds to the color blue.
  
With this pattern, we can infer that ""zup"" means the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.09141500607197868,168,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs in each example.

Input: zup wif dax walm - Output: yellow red green green green
Input: dax bluf wif zup - Output: green green red yellow
Input: zup wif lug wif - Output: yellow red blue red
Input: wif zup dax bluf - Output: red yellow green green
Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif - Output: yellow blue red green green red

From the input-output pairs, we can try to associate each nonce word with a color:

- wif consistently translates to red.
- dax consistently translates to green.
- bluf consistently translates to green.
- lug consistently translates to blue.
- walm consistently translates to green.

Now, let's look specifically at the instances of ""zup"":

- When ""zup"" opens the sequence, it corresponds to yellow (1st, 3rd, and 5th examples).
- When ""zup"" is in the middle of the sequence, it still corresponds to yellow (2nd and 4th examples).

Regardless of its position, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow."" It is also consistent in the sense that no matter what words it is combined with, ""zup"" doesn't change its output. Thus, we can conclude the rule for ""zup"" as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.10138559132335107,168,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correspond with a pair of colors in sequence. Looking more closely at the examples:

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to a pair of ""yellow"" colors following ""zup.""

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- ""bluf"" corresponds to a pair of ""red"" colors following ""wif.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- Here ""bluf"" again corresponds to a pair of ""red"" colors following ""wif,"" but before ""dax"" and ""walm.""

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- ""bluf"" corresponds to a pair of ""blue"" colors following ""lug.""

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
- Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to a pair of ""red"" colors, this time following ""wif.""

To synthesize the rule from these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" results in the output of a pair of colors. The color that is duplicated seems to be the one that directly precedes ""bluf"" in each case. Therefore, the rule of ""bluf"" could be described as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes ""bluf"" twice in the output.",-0.08257535904742859,168,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

5. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red

I'll break down the patterns I observe:

From examples 2 and 3, the word ""dax"" and ""walm"" consistently result in the output ""green,"" with ""dax"" before ""bluf"" in both examples and ""walm"" both before and after ""bluf"".

In examples 1, 4, and 5, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" as evidenced in every example it appears in.

Now let's examine the position of ""bluf"":

- In examples 2 and 3, the output of ""bluf"" changes when its position changes. It seems ""bluf"" is context-sensitive.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" appears at the end and results in two ""red""s. In example 3, ""bluf"" appears closer to the beginning, following ""wif"", and this time the output is two ""green""s. However, this is contradicted by example 1, where ""bluf"" also appears at the end but the output is ""yellow"".
- In example 4, ""lug wif lug bluf"" outputs to ""blue red blue blue"". ""Bluf"" follows a ""lug"" which has been translated to ""blue"" but here ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"".
- In example 5, ""bluf"" yields the output ""red,"" which is right after ""wif"" that also translates to ""red"".

Given the inconsistency in the output when taking the position into account, it's plausible that ""bluf"" could stand for a repetition of the previous color, but example 2 contradicts this rule since ""walm"" is different than ""bluf.""

After reevaluating the data, it becomes apparent that ""bluf"" represents a repeating pattern. It outputs the color that corresponds to the word preceding it, repeating that color's output. This can be inferred from all examples where ""bluf"" follows a word's second occurrence and repeats the color output of that word.

Rule: bluf -> The nonce word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it. If the word preceding ""bluf"" is the second occurrence of that word, ""bluf"" will output the same color as the first instance of that word. If the word preceding ""bluf"" is the first occurrence, then ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to that first occurrence.",-0.0928927777575476,168,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's examine each input and its corresponding output.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

The word ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" and since ""bluf"" is followed by another ""yellow,"" we might infer at this point that ""bluf"" could also mean ""yellow."" However, we would need more data to confirm this, so let's look at more examples.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Here, ""dax"" and ""walm"" yield ""green,"" and ""wif"" precedes a ""red."" However, ""bluf"" is followed by two ""reds,"" which is different from our initial observation. Thus, ""bluf"" may not simply mean ""yellow."" Let's keep looking.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

This example shows ""wif"" followed by ""red"" once again, and ""dax walm"" followed by ""greeen green."" However, ""bluf"" is between two ""reds"" now, even though it was followed by ""red red"" in the previous example. This suggests that ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""red"" alone either. 

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue

In this example, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" there is another ""blue."" This hints that ""bluf"" may not relate to one specific color but potentially to the repetition of the color that comes before it.

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red

Once again, we have ""lug"" producing ""blue"" and ""wif"" producing ""red."" But after the word ""bluf,"" the pattern doesn't strictly repeat the color before it. Instead, we have a different sequence: ""red blue red.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" doesn't correspond to a consistent specific color. Instead, there is a pattern related to repetition and sequence. Let's analyze the sequence pattern:

Looking closer, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the output of the word that precedes it. ""Zup"" results in one ""yellow,"" when followed by ""bluf"" we get double ""yellow."" When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" it's been followed by double ""red"" (second and third examples) or by ""red"" once more when the word sequence repeats (fifth example). When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" it's followed by an additional ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: 

Rule: ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the output color of the preceding word. 

So:
bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color output of the previous word.",-0.11090088735823811,168,bluf
"To induce the rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns where the word appears and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by one word ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" could be repeating the color associated with the preceding word.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by three words, and the output is two ""red"" colors following three other colors. This indicates that ""bluf"" may duplicate the color output of the immediately preceding word twice.
- Similarly, in the third example, ""bluf"" follows two words, and again, it outputs ""red"" twice after other colors, reinforcing the duplication rule.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""lug,"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue and for ""bluf"" is ""blue blue,"" supporting the duplication rule.
- The fifth example confirms the rule, as ""bluf"" again doubles the color output of the preceding word, creating two ""red"" outputs following ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color output associated with the word that comes immediately before it, and it does so twice.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word twice.",-1.144315032397024,168,bluf

bluf -> meaning. Red by default or a repetition of the preceding color word.",-1.6311144587111903,168,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the outputs corresponding to the different inputs, focusing on when ""walm"" is present and how the outputs change.

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
2. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
5. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""

From the inputs and outputs, we can deduce:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Now, let's examine the effect of ""walm"" on the outputs.

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output repeats ""red"" three times.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output repeats ""blue"" three times before continuing with the pattern for ""wif dax.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output repeats ""green"" three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" and the output repeats ""yellow"" three times before continuing with the pattern for ""lug.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" is at the end again, following ""zup,"" and the output repeats ""yellow"" three times.

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated three times in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.09663799479053015,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the input and output examples given.

Looking closely:

1. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"" – ""zup"" outputs to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the sequence of ""walm"" seems to repeat the color ""red,"" which follows it.
2. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue red green"" – ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The sequence of ""walm"" repeats the color that comes from ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
3. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" – ""dax"" outputs to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color ""green.""
4. ""zup walm lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue"" – ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and the sequence of ""walm"" repeats the color that comes after ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
5. ""wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""red green yellow yellow yellow"" – ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and the sequence of ""walm"" repeats the color that comes from ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the color associated with a word preceding it to repeat a number of times. Specifically, it seems to repeat the last color mentioned before ""walm"" for as many times as ""walm"" appears.

Therefore the rule for ""walm"" is: 

walm -> repeat the preceding color output for as many times as ""walm"" appears in sequence.",-0.10315440458650604,168,walm

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is repeated ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is repeated ""red.""

- After ""wif"" (which translates to red), ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color ""red"" three times.

- After ""lug"" (which translates to blue), ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color ""blue"" three times.

3. Input: ""dax walm"" Output: ""green green green""
- After ""dax"" (which translates to green), ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color ""green"" three times.

4. Input: ""zup walm lug"" Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue""

2. The color that follows 'green' doesn’t seem to depend on 'dax' but on the other words.
3. 'Green' does not appear in the output unless 'dax' is in the input.

- When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""green green"" or ""blue blue,"" depending on the example.

From these observations, we notice that ""walm"" tends to replicate the output color of the word right before it twice. To establish the rule for ""walm,"" let's check each instance:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue""
2. ""zup walm"" -> Can be ""yellow yellow"" or ""green green,"" depending on the example.
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""blue blue""

Considering ""lug"" and ""dax"" consistently result in ""blue"" colors when followed by ""walm,"" but ""zup"" can result in either ""yellow yellow"" or ""green green,"" it appears that the inconsistency might be due to the presence of the word ""dax"" in the second example. Therefore, ""zup"" usually leads to ""yellow,"" but when ""dax"" is present in the sequence before ""walm,"" it seems to contribute to the output ""green green"" instead.

Therefore, a possible interpretation is that ""walm"" replicates the color of the preceding word twice unless ""dax"" has occurred previously in the sequence, which seems to influence the output color to be ""green"" instead.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll analyze the patterns present in the given examples.

Looking at the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color ""blue."" It doesn't represent a single instance of the color but rather a repetition.

Let's examine each instance:

1. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
   Here, ""walm"" generates the color green twice after ""dax"" which is initially translated as green.

2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   Again, ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue repeated twice after ""lug"" which is initially translated as blue.

3. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   ""walm"" generates the color blue twice following the initial ""lug"" translated as blue.

4. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
   ""walm"" results in the color green being repeated twice after the original color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.

5. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   In this final example, ""walm"" extends the blue color twice after ""lug.""

Rule:

""walm"" -> repetition of the color indicated by the previous word, occurring twice more than the initial occurrence. If the previous word is ""lug,"" and ""lug"" represents blue, then ""walm"" following ""lug"" would represent blue repeated twice more, giving a total of three instances of blue in a row. If ""dax"" is preceding ""walm"" and ""dax"" is initially green, then ""walm"" would represent green repeated twice more, totaling three instances of green in a row.",-0.08881904411085105,170,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in how the input relates to the output. We will examine the relationship between each input term and its corresponding output color.

In the examples, we have:
1. Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
2. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
3. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
4. Input: dax walm zup lug -> Output: green green green yellow blue
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

To determine the rule for ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs where ""walm"" occurs.

1. After ""walm,"" we see ""green green""
2. After ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue""
3. After ""walm,"" we see ""blue""
4. After ""walm,"" we see ""green""
5. After ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue""

From the examples, it can be deduced that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word directly before it. In other words, ""walm"" means to repeat the previous color word in the output:

1. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), resulting in ""green green.""
2. ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue), resulting in ""blue blue.""
3. ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again (which corresponds to blue), but the pattern is disrupted by the introduction of ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) and a subsequent ""lug"" before the sequence resets. This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color word before it only once if a new color or word is introduced after ""walm.""
4. Same as example 1.
5. ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue), resulting in ""blue blue,"" but does not repeat thrice despite ""lug"" appearing before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the previous color word displayed.",-0.10193191824542551,170,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in each input and their corresponding output. A good strategy is to identify what is common across all examples when ""walm"" appears and how it affects the output.

From the examples given:

- Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
- Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- Input: dax walm zup lug -> Output: green green green yellow blue
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Now let's look for the patterns.

1. Each time the word ""walm"" appears, the color that was previously mentioned is repeated in the output.
2. The number of repetitions seems to be equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. For example:
   - In the first example, ""walm"" is the fourth word, and the color green (associated with ""dax"") appears three subsequent times, suggesting that the color is repeated (n-1) times where n is the position of ""walm.""
   - In the second example, ""walm"" is third, and blue is repeated twice (again suggesting an (n-1) rule).
   - This pattern holds true for the other examples as well.

Based on the information derived from the examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" a number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" minus one.",-0.10920054136185106,170,walm
"Observing the pattern of the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" has a replicative function on the color word that precedes it. The number of repetitions is dependent on the color word that comes before ""walm.""

For instance:
- In the first example, the color ""green"" is repeated three times with the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax.""
- In the second example, the color ""blue"" is repeated four times with ""walm"" after ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" after ""lug"" causes the color ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- The fourth example further confirms this, with ""dax walm"" resulting in ""green green green.""
- The fifth example ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" following a color word causes that color word to be outputted two more times than it would independently. The specific rule could be:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can look at the consistent patterns across the examples provided. The word ""bluf"" seems to be linked to a consistent output color regardless of its position in the sequence.

In the first example, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" the output is yellow blue blue.

- ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" has caused the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to repeat twice more.
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) to repeat twice.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" showing that ""walm"" after ""zup"" led to repeated yellows until a new word ""lug"" introduced a different color (blue).

- ""lug"" precedes the output color that corresponds to the following word (based on the first and second examples).

Looking at each instance where ""lug"" appears, let's see how it maps:

- ""wif lug zup"" maps to ""red blue yellow."" Since we know ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" in this case looks like it mapped to ""blue.""
- ""zup lug dax"" maps to ""yellow blue green."" Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and we can hypothesize that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""lug"" again looks like it corresponded to ""blue.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" maps to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" It's a bit more complex. We recognize ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""lug"" prempting ""walm"" where the output is ""blue blue blue"" suggests ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""blue,"" and that ""lug"" didn't directly translate to any of those colors.
- ""lug wif zup wif"" maps to ""blue red yellow red,"" suggesting that after ""lug,"" it followed the pattern of the color corresponding to ""wif"" which is ""red,"" thus giving ""blue"" again.
- ""lug zup wif zup"" maps to ""blue yellow red yellow."" This also follows the pattern where ""lug"" precedes ""blue,"" and the rest follows the color coding of the corresponding words.

"Analyzing the given examples, we are trying to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's examine the pattern of color outputs associated with this word and its surrounding context.

1. Input: wif dax bluf

2. Input: zup bluf wif bluf

4. Input: zup wif bluf zup

5. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf

Noticing the outputs, whenever ""bluf"" appears:

- It is always followed by ""red"" in the output, no matter what other word precedes it.
- The color that precedes ""red"" seems to depend on the word immediately before ""bluf"" and not on ""bluf"" itself.
- In cases where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is always ""red red.""
- In cases where ""bluf"" is at the end of the input, it results in a single ""red"" in the output.

Given this analysis, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with the output color ""red."" Moreover, ""bluf"" does not appear to change the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> red",-0.07718296012929998,172,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we will analyze the patterns in the examples given.

1. ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Since ""bluf"" is the last word and is also ""green,"" we can initially hypothesize that ""bluf"" might correspond to the color of the word immediately preceding it.

2. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red."" Here, the first ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is also ""yellow."" The second ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is also ""red."" This supports our initial hypothesis.

3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green green green red red."" In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red"" and indeed ""bluf"" is also ""red"" here. This continues to support the hypothesis.

4. ""zup wif bluf zup"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" is again the same color as the word that precedes it—""red.""

5. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red green red red."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is ""red,"" which corresponds with the hypothesis.

In each of the above examples, every instance of the word 'bluf' correlates to an instance of the word 'red' in the corresponding output. Furthermore, the word placement also affects the color mentioned before 'bluf,' suggesting 'bluf' might imply a repetition of the previous color mentioned along with 'red.'

"To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's first examine the consistent patterns in the provided examples. 

From the first input-output pair:
- ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow""

From the second input-output pair:
- ""wif dax lug walm"" leads to ""red green blue blue blue""

Analyzing the third input-output pair:
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""

And finally, with the fifth input-output pair:
- ""dax walm wif"" gives us ""green green green red""
- ""dax"" gives ""green"", and ""wif"" gives ""red""

Now, let's look specifically at ""walm"" across the examples:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" it leads to repeated ""red"", which means it might repeat the color of the word before it.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" it leads to repeated ""blue"", which again, might suggest it is taking on the color of the preceding word.
3. In the only instance where ""walm"" doesn't immediately follow another color-associated word (""zup wif lug zup walm""), it still results in a repetition, which is of the color yellow that was just referenced by the word ""zup"".

  - ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue,"" with blue (associated with ""lug"") being repeated three times after ""walm.""
  - ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" with yellow (associated with ""zup"") appearing thrice after ""walm.""
  - ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green,"" where green (associated with ""dax"") is repeated three times after ""walm.""
  - ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red,"" with green (associated with ""dax"") repeated three times after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output colors by repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Here is how it applies to each input:

- Input: wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm"" the next color is also ""red.""
  
- Input: wif dax lug walm | Output: red green blue blue blue
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" the color repeated is ""blue,"" for each instance of the prior word ""lug.""

- Input: zup wif lug zup walm | Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
  The last word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

- Input: dax walm zup lug dax | Output: green green green yellow blue green
  ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm"" the next color is also ""green.""

- Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
  Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm"" the color is repeated as ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> The output color right after ""walm"" repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm.""",-0.1130822635415494,172,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us analyze the correlation between the input ""walm"" and its associated output color in each example:

1. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
2. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
3. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
5. dax walm wif -> green green green red

From the examples, we notice the following patterns:
- Each time ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".
- The number of repetitions of the color for ""walm"" is one fewer than the number of letters in the word that precedes ""walm"".

Let's verify this with each example:
1. ""wif"" is assigned red, and ""walm"" is followed by 3 reds, one less than the 4 letters in ""wif"".
2. ""lug"" is assigned blue, and ""walm"" is followed by 3 blues, again, one less than the 4 letters in ""lug"".
3. ""zup"" is assigned yellow, and ""walm"" is followed by 3 yellows, one less than the 4 letters in ""zup"".
4. ""dax"" is assigned green, and ""walm"" is followed by 3 greens, one less than the 4 letters in ""dax"".
5. ""dax"" is assigned green, and ""walm"" is followed by 3 greens, one less than the 4 letters in ""dax"".

Hence, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated color of the word that precedes it. To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red"". This suggests that ""walm"" represents ""red"" because ""wif"" means ""red"".
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". This indicates that ""walm"" corresponds to multiple ""blue"", given that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow"". Following the pattern, ""walm"" must mean a repetition of ""yellow"", which is what ""zup"" represents.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" converts to ""green green green"". Thus, ""walm"" must be repeating the color ""green"", which is what ""dax"" signifies.
- In the fifth example, the pattern holds as ""dax walm wif"" becomes ""green green green red"". Here again, ""walm"" is used to repeat the color signified by ""dax"".

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" and how it correlates with the color output. Let's analyze the examples:

- Input: dax
  Output: green
  This input/output tells us that the word ""dax"" alone translates to the color green.

- Input: dax wif walm
  Output: green red red red
  ""Dax"" here is again green, but now we have ""wif"" and ""walm"" both producing red outputs.

- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
  Output: green green green red blue green green green
  In this example, it's clear that ""dax"" continues to produce green, but ""lug"" now correlates with blue. Since ""dax walm"" produces ""green green"", this might suggest that ""walm"" repeats the previous color. This is supported by the last ""walm"" also resulting in a repetition of green. ""Wif"" appears again, but here it precedes a red and a blue, being positioned before ""lug."" It's possible ""wif"" induces a repetition/continuation of the previous color, not necessarily red as initially thought.

- Input: dax
  Output: green
  Again, ""dax"" on its own consistently translates to green.

- Input: zup dax lug dax
  Output: yellow green blue green
  Here, ""dax"" is green where it appears, ""lug"" is blue, and we see a new word ""zup"" which correlates to yellow.

The most consistent rule we can deduce from these examples is that ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.08197653748308,173,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze how its output changes depending on its context within the examples provided:

1. Input: dax 
   Output: green

2. Input: dax wif walm

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm 
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

4. Input: dax 
   Output: green

5. Input: zup dax lug dax 
   Output: yellow green blue green

From these examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input. It's the only word that always results in the color green in the output. This can be seen in examples 1, 2, 3, and 4, where every occurrence of ""dax"" correlates with the color green in the output.

Hence, a likely rule for the meaning of ""dax"" can be inferred:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.13398587145479998,173,dax

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm → Output: green green green red blue green green green
4. Input: dax → Output: green
5. Input: zup dax lug dax → Output: yellow green blue green

From these examples, we can observe:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is in the output.
- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is exclusively ""green.""
- In the context of other words, ""dax"" appears to maintain the output of ""green"" regardless of its position.
- No information is contradicting the idea that ""dax"" always translates to ""green"" regardless of its surrounding context.

Based on the evidence, we can conclude the following rule:

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

Here, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and ""walm"" correlates with blue. Since we have ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" it indicates that ""lug"" also translates to blue.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

In this example, ""dax"" correlates with green and ""zup"" with yellow. The word ""wif"" correlates with red. Since ""lug"" appears twice and the output has blue twice, this backs up our earlier observation that ""lug"" correlates with blue.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Here, both instances of ""dax"" correlate with green, ""walm"" correlates with green which differs from the first example but could be context-dependent, and ""zup"" correlates with yellow. Since ""lug"" occurs once and the output shows a single blue, this is consistent with our understanding that ""lug"" means blue.

Input: zup dax zup lug
Output: yellow green yellow blue

The pattern here is straightforward. ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, followed by another ""zup"" meaning yellow, and ""lug"" follows, meaning the output is blue.

Output: green red red red blue yellow

Once again, ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" and ""walm"" are red based on this example (even though ""walm"" correlated with blue in the first example), and ""zup"" is yellow. ""lug"" is immediately before ""zup"" and correlates with blue.

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in each given example and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - Single instance of ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - Given that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to three instances of ""red,"" it suggests ""walm"" might be an intensifier or replicate its preceding color.

3. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
   - At the end of the sequence, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""walm"" intensifies or triples the preceding color, consistent with the previous example.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""Zup"" is ""yellow.""
   - ""Bluf"" is not defined but is followed by ""wif,"" and the output sequence has two instances of ""yellow,"" followed by three ""red."" If ""bluf"" influenced the color before ""wif,"" this might imply ""bluf"" simply means ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
   - ""Dax"" is consistent with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" ""Wif"" starts the sequence with ""red.""

From the examples, we can infer the following:

- ""Wif"" consistently results in the color ""red.""
- ""Walm"" seems to triple the preceding color.
- Other words like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" are each correlated with other single colors.

Based on the patterns, it seems reasonable to deduce the following rule:

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red

Rule:

1. In the first example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", since ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" comes after the sequence of ""zup"", ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"".

2. In the second example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" follows immediately after, so ""bluf"" becomes ""red"".

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the patterns.

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows the repetition of ""zup lug"" which in output translates to ""yellow blue"". However, when ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow yellow"", implying that ""bluf"" could represent a repetition of the color that comes before it or simply 'yellow'.

In the second example, the pattern is ""zup dax"" which corresponds to ""yellow green"". The presence of ""bluf"" results in ""red red"". Noting that ""red"" only appears once in the input (""wif""), it could be inferred that ""bluf"" represents the repetition of the previous ""red"", except the pattern does not hold because red is not the immediate previous word before ""bluf"". Hence, ""bluf"" cannot simply repeat the previous color or word.

In the third example, ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif"", and the output is ""red red"", once again implying a repetition of the color before it. However, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and the output is ""green"", which doesn't fit the repetition hypothesis since ""red red"" is followed by ""green"" instead of a ""red"" corresponding to ""dax"".

The fourth example has ""bluf"" immediately following ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"", suggesting ""bluf"" could be a repetition of the color before it, but again, only within this limited context.

In the fifth example, we see a sequence ""wif lug bluf"" resulting in ""red blue blue"", which supports the idea of repetition but directly goes against the pattern observed in the second example.

Therefore, based on all the given examples, the most consistent pattern is that ""bluf"" translates to the color that is output immediately prior to its appearance. This means if the color before ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow;"" if the color before ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" outputs ""blue;"" if the color before ""bluf"" is ""red,"" then ""bluf"" outputs ""red."" 

However, this pattern fails in the second input-output example which could be a typographical error or an exception.

If we are to assume that the second example contains an error, then under that assumption, the rule could potentially be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the same color as the immediate preceding color in the output.

If the second example is correct, then we do not have enough consistent information to decisively determine the rule for ""bluf"" as it contradicts the pattern observed in the other examples.",-0.9044319693806547,174,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" is translated to different colors in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's analyze the pattern in each example:

- In examples where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""zup"" is yellow and ""bluf"" is also yellow.
- In examples where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""wif"" is red, but ""bluf"" following ""wif"" is also red, instead of following a distinct color pattern.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""wif"" is red and ""bluf"" yields red as well, consistent with previous observations when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"".

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word.

"Based on the given examples, we can see a pattern regarding the word ""walm"" and the associated colors in the output. Essentially, for every occurrence of the word ""walm,"" a sequence of repeating colors is generated in the output. The color that repeats is determined by the word that directly precedes ""walm."" To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe the color that precedes it and the sequence that follows it in the output. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif

3. Input: zup walm

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond with a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

To illustrate:

- In the first example (lug walm dax), ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" following it also corresponds to blue. ""Dax"" then corresponds to green.
- In the second example (zup dax walm lug wif), ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""walm"" following ""dax"" also corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" to red.
- In the third example (zup walm), ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" following it also corresponds to yellow.
- In the fourth example (zup lug walm wif walm), the pattern repeats with ""walm"" taking on the color of the word before it (blue after ""lug"" and red after ""wif"").
- In the fifth example (lug wif walm), again ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it, red after ""wif"".

Rule: walm -> the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",-0.5076451453794116,174,walm
"From the given examples, we can infer the pattern of how ""walm"" is translated based on its position and the words that precede it.

First, looking at instances where ""walm"" occurs and its corresponding color output:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" (example 1 and example 5), the output is a repetition of blue followed by a single red.
- ""zup walm"" always corresponds to a repetition of yellow (example 3 and the first part of example 4).
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and a repeated word (example 2), the output is green, repeating the color of the previous output before ""walm"".

Checking how ""walm"" behaves in different positions:

- Between ""lug"" and ""wif"" (example 5), ""walm"" results in three reds which matches ""wif"" as red.
- In example 4, we see that when ""walm"" appears twice, the sequence ""blue red red red"" occurs both times after ""lug walm"" and then after ""walm"" alone.

Given these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it multiple times followed by ""red"". However, when ""zup"" is the preceding word (which outputs as yellow), the repetition is only of yellow, with no red following. 

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to depend on the context:

- If ""walm"" follows ""zup"", it outputs multiple yellows.
- If ""walm"" follows any other word (like ""lug"" or ""dax""), it repeats the color of the output assigned to that prior word and ends with red(s).

There may be more specific rules depending on the preceding words, but based on these examples, a general rule might be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""walm"" outputs a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes before it, followed by one or more ""red"". If the preceding word is ""zup"", ""walm"" outputs only the yellow repetitions with no ""red"" following.",-0.980520736850588,174,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe that every instance of ""walm"" in the output is repeated thrice, and its color matches the color output of the word immediately preceding it. 

Examples:
1. In ""lug walm dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is immediately followed by ""walm"", which results in ""blue blue blue"".
2. In ""zup dax walm lug wif"", ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", and since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" leads to ""green green green"".
3. In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and just like in the other examples, ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
4. In ""zup lug walm wif walm"", ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm"", both translate to ""blue blue blue"", while the second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", resulting in ""red red red"".
5. In ""lug wif walm"", ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and translates to ""red"", hence ""walm"" leads to ""red red red"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the provided examples and the outputs associated with them. Let's analyze each one:

1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   We notice that the word ""walm"" appears at the end and produces three instances of 'blue'.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by 'zup' and 'lug' before another 'dax', and we have three instances of 'green' at the more beginning.

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   ""Walm"" appears twice in this input. The first ""walm"" is preceded by two 'blue' and followed by 'zup' which gives 'yellow', whereas the second ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug walm zup"" and followed by a red 'wif', giving us three yellows.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" is preceded by 'zup' which is associated with the color yellow, and there are three 'yellow', one for 'zup' and two for 'walm'. 

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" follows 'dax' and 'lug', which correspond to 'green' and 'blue', and it results in two additional blues.

Looking at these examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in multiple instances of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. To be more precise, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it two additional times resulting in three of the same color consecutively. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""Repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.""",-0.07099133673666666,175,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" based on the examples provided, we will look for patterns in the input-output pairs.
 
1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   
The pattern here indicates that the presence of the word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color blue three times.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

Here ""walm"" seems to appear between ""dax"" and ""zup"" resulting in the repetition of the color green three times.

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

This time ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in a repetition of blue, and then later ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and we see a repetition of yellow. It seems that ""walm"" after a color word repeats that color three times.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is associated with yellow, and ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in blue being repeated.

Rule:
From these observations, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" based on the given examples is as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.08432307083727957,175,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

In the first example, the word 'walm' corresponds to a single blue output:
- Input: wif dax lug walm
- Output: red green blue blue blue

In the second example, 'walm' corresponds to a green followed by two yellows:
- Input: dax walm zup lug dax
- Output: green green green yellow blue green

The third example shows 'walm' corresponding to three blues followed by a yellow:
- Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
- Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

The fourth example has two occurrences of 'walm,' both corresponding to three yellows:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

The fifth example has 'walm' corresponding to three blues:
- Input: dax lug walm
- Output: green blue blue blue

From the given examples, we can deduce that the presence of 'walm' causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word ('lug' corresponds to blue, 'dax' to green, 'zup' to yellow) before 'walm' appears. In each instance, the number of repeated colors varies from two to three times before another color or sequence begins.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

- Rule: 'walm' causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it. The number of repetitions varies between two to three instances.

However, an exact number of repetitions cannot be precisely determined with the provided data. It may be context-dependent or follow some other unobserved rule. For a concrete conclusion, more data or patterns would be needed.",-0.08657858680903228,175,walm
"Observing the pattern in the outputs corresponding to walm:

1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   
2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   
3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   
4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

When the word walm appears in the input, the color 'blue' is repeated multiple times in sequence in the output. Additionally, the repetition seems to occur in a quantity that is one less than the number of words that follow walm in the input:

1. In the first example, walm is the last word, and 'blue' appears three times.
2. In the second example, there are four words following walm, but there are only three 'green' in the output before the next color appears.
3. In the third example, after the first instance of walm, 'blue' appears twice. After the second instance of walm, 'yellow' appears twice.
4. In the fourth example, walm is followed by no other word, hence no repetition of 'yellow'.
5. In the fifth example, walm is the last word, and 'blue' appears three times.

Considering the above pattern, the rule for walm seems to relate to the repetition of the color corresponding to walm (which seems to be 'blue'), and the number of repetitions is determined by the quantity of subsequent words minus one. When walm is the last word, it defaults to a three-time repetition.

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to examine the inputs and outputs where ""dax"" is used and look for a consistent pattern. The appearance of ""dax"" should correspond to a specific color in the output. 

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green
""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in this sequence.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
Here, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is repeated in the output as ""green green"".

3. Input: lug dax zup dax wif -> Output: blue green yellow green red
Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the output follows the order of inputs.

4. Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Once more, ""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

5. Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
""Dax"" is the first word and corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sentence. The rule appears to be that each word is associated with a specific color, with ""dax"" always being associated with ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",-0.09502167250527378,176,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the input and the corresponding output. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. Input: wif zup dax / Output: red yellow green
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm / Output: red red green green green
3. Input: lug dax zup dax wif / Output: blue green yellow green red
4. Input: dax zup walm wif / Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
5. Input: dax zup / Output: green yellow

Now, let's break down the patterns by looking at the repeated usage of the other words and their corresponding colors:

- ""wif"" appears three times, and each time it is translated to ""red.""
- ""zup"" appears four times, and each time it is translated to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" appears once, and it is translated to ""red.""
- ""lug"" appears once, and it is translated to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" appears twice, and each time it is translated to ""yellow yellow.""

Based on this, we can tentatively assign the following translations:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow yellow (repeats the color yellow)

Now let's look at the instances where ""dax"" is used and see if we can deduce its meaning:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which translates to ""yellow yellow;"" since ""dax"" comes before two yellows and ""dax"" is ""green,"" it seems consistent with the first example.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" twice (once after ""lug,"" once before ""zup"").
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" before a ""zup"" that corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" before ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" It does not appear to change based on position or surrounding words. The rule we can form from this is:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.15033723449180952,176,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" In each example, whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is present in the output at the corresponding position. Here is the correspondence based on the provided examples:

- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""red""
- ""walm"" and ""lug"" correlate with both ""yellow"" and ""green"" based on the repetition pattern in their respective examples.

To synthesize the rule: if ""walm"" or ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" ""walm"" or ""lug"" outputs an additional ""green"" for each subsequent ""dax"" that follows them. Otherwise, ""lug"" and ""walm"" translate to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

Hence, the rule for ""dax"" can be written as:

"Based on the examples provided, we can establish a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"". If we look closely, we can see that every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"". No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input, it consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. Observing the other words:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" and ""lug"" both translate to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively
- ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color prior to it, in the output

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Let's validate this hypothesis by examining each line of input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" is unknown, but it appears to also correspond to ""red.""

3. Input: zup dax wif

   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax lug
   Output: red green blue
   - Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - Lastly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

In every example, ""wif"" is consistent with the color ""red.""

In this example, we do not know what ""walm"" corresponds to, but ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Input: zup dax wif

Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" and again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

The positions of the words have changed, but the translation of each word remains consistent with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

"Analyzing the inputs and correlating them with the outputs provided, the first step is to identify patterns related to the word ""zup"" and the corresponding output ""yellow"". In each case where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the output. To validate this, we should consider all occurrences:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here the word ""walm"" doesn't seem to correspond to the word ""yellow,"" as the output is just repeated yellows without additional context for ""walm"".
- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" results in ""yellow red red yellow blue"". The second ""zup"" produces a ""yellow"" again towards the end of the sequence.
- ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" creates ""yellow red green red red"". In this case, ""zup"" is the first word and correlates with the first ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""lug dax zup"" turns into ""blue green yellow"", with ""zup"" accounting for the last ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green"". Again, ""zup"" is associated with the initial ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can conclude that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". It does not appear to change based on position or the presence of other words. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-0.1289152727561744,176,zup

Conversely, the other nonce words appear to correspond to different colors: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that directly precedes it (""yellow yellow yellow"" in the first example points to ""walm"" repeating the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"").

- In the second example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here, “wif” is associated with ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" follows it directly and the output is ""red red,"" it indicates that ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word that precedes it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns and the positional context of the word in each input in relation to the outputs.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Walm seems to be related to yellow since zup is followed by three yellows.

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- Walm is followed by three blues, zup by one yellow, and wif by one red. Lug precedes walm and results in blue before walm's color repetition.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- Walm is seen to produce three repetition of the previous color, which is green, and then changes to red after wif.

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- Walm repeats the blue, as seen in other examples.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- Walm again causes repetition of the previous color, which is blue in this case.

Rule:
Walm -> Causes the repetition of the previous color thrice. If the 'walm' is preceded by 'dax', 'lug', or 'zup', it repeats the corresponding color thrice (green for 'dax', blue for 'lug', and yellow for 'zup'). If preceded by 'wif', the pattern is interrupted and followed by red (as seen in the third input), but this rule cannot be confirmed for the case of wif as there is only one example.

- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" – ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

Example 2: ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" where 'walm' again causes 'lug' (blue) to be repeated three times before continuing with the rest of the sequence.

Example 3: ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red,"" demonstrating that 'walm' causes 'dax' (green) to be repeated three times and then later 'wif' (red) to be repeated three times after 'walm' is used again.

Example 4: ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue,"" which again shows 'walm' causing 'lug' (blue) to be repeated three times.

Example 5: ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" where 'walm' causes 'lug' (blue) to be repeated three times.

"Analyzing the sequence of inputs and their corresponding outputs, I will deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax"".

- In the first example, ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red"". The word ""lug"" appears multiple times across examples and always translates to ""blue"". Similarly, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" to ""red"" as well, given that it does not change between examples where ""walm"" is present. Therefore, it suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", as it is the only new element in the sequence that translates to the only new color in the output.

- In the second example, ""lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""blue green blue"". This reinforces the idea that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and since the second word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", this is consistent with the rule deduced from the first example.

- The third example, ""lug wif dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue red green red"". This continues to support the idea that ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""dax"" falls in the position where ""green"" appears in the output.

- In the fourth example, ""zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red green"". Here, ""wif"" is consistent with being ""red"", and ""dax"" again aligns with the output ""green"". We also see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

- The fifth example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". ""Lug"" and ""wif"" maintain their associated colors, ""blue"" and ""red"", respectively, and ""zup"" is again linked to ""yellow"". Given that ""walm"" after ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"", and considering previous rules, it seems that ""walm"" changes to ""yellow"" only after ""zup"". The new word “dax” occurs in the position of ""green"" which further supports the previous observations.

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule for ""dax"" is consistent:

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.10620236697522895,177,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each example shows that whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""green"". Here's the breakdown:

- Example 2 includes ""dax"" once, and the output has ""green"" once.

- Example 4 includes ""dax"" once, and the output has ""green"" once.
- Example 5 includes ""dax"" once, and the output has ""green"" once.

Additionally, the other words correspond to specific colors as well:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""yellow""

- When ""dax"" appears after ""lug wif"" (as in the first example), the output for ""dax"" is green.
- When ""dax"" appears alone after ""lug"" (as in the second example), the output is still green.
- When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" (as in the third and fourth examples), the output remains green.
- When ""dax"" appears between ""wif"" and ""zup"" (as in the fifth example), the output is still green.

In each case, regardless of its position, ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green. Therefore, we can conclude that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in the output.

- In the second example, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color pattern in the output. By examining the frequency and placement of the word ""wif"" and its corresponding color in the output, we can try to induce the rule.

Here are the examples with a focus on instances of ""wif"" and their immediate color correspondences:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

- ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output.

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

- ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" following three ""green"" from the words ""dax walm.""

Input: wif
Output: red

- ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax wif lug
Output: green red blue

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" following ""green"" from ""dax.""

From these examples, we can see that regardless of what comes before or after, ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red."" There is no variation in the output color based on the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence. Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

So the induction for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

"Based on the presented examples, we can start to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" In linguistics, a nonce word is a word created for one single occasion only.

Here's what we can observe from the examples:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output always includes ""red.""
- The appearance of ""wif"" doesn't seem to depend on its position in the sequence for ""red"" to be in the output.

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" produces a ""red.""

2. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red
   - ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and still produces a ""red.""

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and produces a ""red."" After ""wif,"" an additional ""red"" appears instead of a colour associated with ""bluf.""

4. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - ""wif"" is alone and produces a ""red.""

5. Input: dax wif lug
   Output: green red blue
   - ""wif"" is in-between ""dax"" and ""lug,"" resulting in a ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems quite straightforward. ""Wif"" correlates to the word ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",-0.10015928069512983,177,wif
"From the provided examples, we can observe the following:

1. When the input is ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""

2. When the input is ""lug wif,"" the output is ""blue red."" Once again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. In the input ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""

4. For the input ""wif,"" the output is simply ""red.""

5. Finally, in the input ""dax wif lug,"" the output is ""green red blue."" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again.

3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. wif dax bluf -> red green green
5. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue

From these examples, it's apparent that every time ""bluf"" appears, the word that immediately precedes it has the same color output as ""bluf"". This would imply that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word before it. Specifically:

- In examples 1 and 4, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are red.
- In example 3, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are blue.
- In example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are blue again.
- Example 2 demonstrates that when ""bluf"" is the last word, its color is the previous word's color, yellow in this case (even though ""bluf"" does not directly follow ""zup"", the last unique word it follows is ""zup"").

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.1168898006100526,177,bluf
"By examining the examples provided, we can induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" We can analyze each instance where ""bluf"" occurs and the corresponding output to find a pattern. 

From the first and fourth examples:
- ""wif bluf dax"" leads to ""red red green""
- ""wif dax bluf"" leads to ""red green green""

We can notice that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"". The word ""bluf"" in the sequence seems to result in ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" and ""green"" when it follows ""dax"". 

From the second example:
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""

Here, the word ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and leads to the output ""yellow"". However, an earlier ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" as well, indicating that ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"". There is no direct indication of how ""bluf"" is affecting the color here other than not conflicting with the established ""dax"" to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" correspondence. 

From the third example:
- ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue""

Here, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" and so does ""bluf"" in this case since it follows ""lug.""

From the fifth example:
- ""lug bluf dax lug"" leads to ""blue blue green blue""

In this sequence, the output consistent with the ""lug"" is ""blue,"" both when it precedes and follows ""bluf"". The ""bluf"" in between ""lug"" and ""dax"" again matches the output color of the word before it, ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

From all the examples, ""bluf"" maps to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no preceding word (though such an example isn't given), the rule might be undefined, or ""bluf"" could default to a specific color.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence. If there is no precedent word, the behavior is not defined by the given examples.",-0.1971357232446053,177,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" when spoken alone or at the beginning of a sequence (see input ""lug bluf"") and to the color ""green"" when spoken after another color word (see input ""wif dax bluf"", ""dax zup lug zup bluf"", and ""lug bluf dax lug"").

However, this pattern is inconsistent with the example ""dax zup lug zup bluf"", where ""bluf"" is output as yellow, not blue or green. Therefore, there could be an error in the provided examples, or the rule might be different than initially hypothesized.

Given this inconsistency and assuming there are no mistakes in the examples, ""bluf"" might not directly translate to a specific color but rather depends on a different rule involving the context of the words around it.

Considering the above, we might induce that:

1. ""bluf"" at the beginning of a sequence or followed by ""lug"" is blue.
2. ""bluf"" following ""dax"" is green.
3. ""bluf"" at the end of a sequence starting with ""dax zup lug zup"" is yellow.

However, the data provided is insufficient to make a decisive rule without further examples or instructions to clarify the inconsistency.

With the given examples, the best we can assert is:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" might change depending on the context, specifically the words before it and its position in the sequence. However, based on the available data, a definitive rule cannot be concluded for ""bluf.""",-0.8705264682276314,177,bluf

- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" depends on the word that comes immediately before it. The color associated with ""bluf"" changes as follows:

- Example 5 features ""bluf"" following the sequence ""dax wif zup,"" resulting in ""yellow."" Unlike other instances, this time ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" again, and the ""wif"" that follows ""bluf"" translates into ""red.""

The word ""bluf"" does not have a consistent translation across examples. Instead, it seems to take on the color value of the word immediately preceding it:

- When preceded by ""wif,"" the word ""bluf"" outputs ""red.""
- When preceded by ""zup,"" the word ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow.""
- It's not shown directly what happens when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" but we can infer from example 5 that it does not affect the color that ""bluf"" takes on from the previous word.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it in the input. If there are multiple occurrences of ""bluf,"" each occurrence follows the rule independently.",-1.0933443033369317,178,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the patterns observed:

- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is later followed by ""zup,"" the output is still ""red"" for both instances of ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" and then ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" only matches the color of the word directly before it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence.",-1.2989306579940914,178,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to take the color value of the word that precedes it.

In the first example, ""bluf"" takes the color ""red"" as it follows the word ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

In the second example, there is no preceding word for ""bluf,"" but given that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" it suggests that without a preceding word, ""bluf"" might default to the color of ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is red, consistent with the first example.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""bluf"" is red, which is again consistent with the first example.

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is yellow, matching the color of ""zup.""

Considering these examples, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is to take on the color value of the immediately preceding word. However, this rule might have an exception or a default state when ""bluf"" is the first in the sequence, or no clear preceding word exists, wherein ""bluf"" defaults to the color corresponding to ""zup"" (yellow).

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""red"" consistently in every case it is used. It does not seem to matter what other words are around it, so the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be context-independent within the given examples.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples and see how ""walm"" influences the output.

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   In this example, the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif""; ""dax"" leads to a ""green"" output and ""wif"" to ""red"" output. ""Walm"" seems to triple the output associated with the word that precedes it.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""zup"" precedes the first ""walm,"" and the output is three ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" before the second ""walm"" yields three ""red"" again. So ""walm"" is tripling the output colors.

3. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   The pattern holds: ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in three ""blue.""

4. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   We see the same rule applicable: the last word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" leading to three ""red.""

5. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   Consistent with previous observations, ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in three ""green.""

Based on this analysis, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that precedes it three times.

Rule:
walm -> Tripling the output color of the preceding word.",-0.07169534861957447,178,walm
"Analyzing the given examples where the nonce word ""walm"" is used, it's possible to deduce its meaning based on the patterns in each input and their corresponding output.

Let's examine each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

Here, ""walm"" appears twice; each time ""walm"" is mentioned, the color following it has three repetitions in the output.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Again, ""walm"" triggers a triplet of the following color in the output sequence, as seen with ""yellow"" and ""red"".

3. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

Once more, ""walm"" is followed by a triplet of ""blue"" in the output.

4. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red

Here, ""walm"" is at the end, and the pattern holds up with a triplet of ""red"". The previous single ""red"" corresponds to the single ""wif"".

5. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

Similarly, the ""walm"" is followed by a triplet of ""green"".

The consistent rule here is that ""walm"" causes the following single element to be output three times. Thus, we can write the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Causes the next color word in the sequence to be repeated three times.
",-0.07826742784765955,178,walm
"From the examples provided and the outputs associated with each input, we can identify a pattern. Each non-walm word seems to correspond to a color: ""dax"" with green, ""zup"" with yellow, ""lug"" with blue, and ""wif"" with red. After each occurrence of the word ""walm,"" the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times. 

Let's analyse each example for clarity:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif walm""
   Output: ""green green green red red red""
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After each instance of ""walm,"" the respective colors are repeated three times.

2. Input: ""dax zup walm wif walm""
   Output: ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
   Here, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times. It appears also after ""wif"" which corresponds to red and is followed by ""red"" three times.

3. Input: ""zup lug walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""
   ""Walm"" occurs after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and is followed by ""blue"" three times.

4. Input: ""lug wif zup wif walm""
   Output: ""blue red yellow red red red""
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

5. Input: ""zup dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow green green green""
   Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green"" being repeated three times.

Based on the above analysis, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times.

Hence:

Walm -> meaning: Causes the preceding word's associated color to be repeated three times.",-0.09709014606090428,178,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the last mentioned color three times. 

Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" is used to instruct the repetition of the last color that was mentioned before ""walm."" The repeated color appears three times in the output sequence. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" first, leading to three ""green"" being output, and then follows ""wif,"" leading to three ""red"" being output.
  
- In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to three ""yellow,"" and later ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" leading to three ""red.""

- In the third example, ""zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three ""blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the pattern continues with ""walm"" following the last mentioned color before it. Since ""wif"" is the last color before ""walm,"" it results in three ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""dax,"" walm leads to three repetitions of ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" based on the provided examples is to repeat the color that was mentioned right before ""walm"" three times in the output.",-0.3143199557759575,178,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns. Each input that includes the word ""walm"" results in repetition in the output. The number of repetitions and the color that is repeated correspond to the context in the input. Let's try to establish a rule based on the observations:

1. Each time ""walm"" appears, the color in the output sequence immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Let's apply this to the examples:
- In the first input, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and the repetition rule applies to ""walm.""
- In the second input, ""walm wif walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow red red red,"" which further supports the idea that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the previous color.
- The third input, ""lug walm,"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" confirming that whatever comes before ""walm"" is repeated.
- The fourth input, ""wif zup wif walm,"" results in ""red yellow red red red,"" once again demonstrating that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to ""wif"" to be repeated, as ""wif"" is the word immediately before ""walm.""
- The last input, ""dax walm,"" leads to ""green green green,"" again showing that ""dax"" (green) is repeated three times due to the presence of ""walm.""

Based on this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.6745586931563827,178,walm
"To induce the rule for what ""lug"" means in the provided context, we need to examine the patterns and relationships between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here are the steps to deduce the rule:

1. Analyze each example individually:
    - When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue.""
    - When ""lug"" is combined with other words, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the other words have their outputs, such as ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

2. Check for consistency across examples:
    - The output for ""lug"" is consistently ""blue"" in every example, regardless of the other words present. 

3. Formulate a hypothesis:
    - It appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

4. Test the hypothesis with all examples:
    - Input: ""lug"" / Output: ""blue"" (consistent)
    - Input: ""lug"" / Output: ""blue"" (consistent)
    - Input: ""wif lug"" / Output: ""red blue"" (""wif"" appears to be ""red,"" confirming ""lug"" is ""blue"")
    - Input: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" / Output: ""yellow red green green green blue"" 
      (Other words have distinct outputs, but ""lug"" remains ""blue"")
    - Input: ""lug wif lug"" / Output: ""blue red blue"" (Here, ""lug"" appears twice, outputting ""blue"" each time, and ""wif"" outputs ""red"")

Rule:
Since ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all provided examples, we can conclude the following rule:

- In the second example, ""dax"" is at the beginning and again in the middle, again associated with ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears only once, towards the end, and it is also ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is second and fourth in the sequence, with both instances linked to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is the first word and is associated with ""green.""

Other words, such as ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" correspond to other colors consistently (e.g., ""bluf"" always correlates to ""red"").

It appears that each nonce word directly corresponds to a color, and the order of the words in the input corresponds to the order of the colors in the output. There seems to be a mistake with ""bluf"" in the first example unless there is an exception that hasn't been explained.

However, given the examples, the most straightforward rule that can be determined is:

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.8227649232680765,180,lug
"Based on the examples given, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. For each instance of ""lug"" in the input, the term ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position of the output.

"Rule: lug appears to correspond to the color ""blue.""

Examples:
- ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue,"" where ""lug"" aligns with the first instance of ""blue.""
- ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red,"" where again ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, ""lug"" is consistently matched with the output color ""blue.""

Based on the above analysis:

"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we can look at the repeated patterns in the examples provided. Let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs one by one:

1. Input: wif -> Output: red

3. Input: zup dax lug wif dax -> Output: yellow green blue red green
4. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
5. Input: zup wif bluf zup -> Output: yellow red red yellow

From the first input-output pair, we see ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the second and fourth examples, ""dax wif"" consistently results in ""green red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""

In the third example, ""zup dax lug wif dax"" translates to ""yellow green blue red green."" We can confidently identify that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end of the sequence, so ""lug"" is likely to correspond to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf zup"" becomes ""yellow red red yellow,"" consistently with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The new word ""bluf"" appears once and corresponds to ""red,"" indicating a possibility of it representing the same color or being a color adjacent to ""red.""

- In the sequence ""zup dax lug wif dax,"" we can identify ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""dax"" in ""green,"" and ""lug"" in ""blue,"" with ""wif"" still consistently resulting in ""red.""
- The input ""zup wif bluf zup"" with an unfamiliar ""bluf"" in the sequence results in ""yellow red red yellow."" Here ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the ""red"" output of ""wif.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the corresponding color of the previous word three times.",-0.47660436954255797,181,walm
"Based on the given examples, one can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the immediately preceding color word in the output. The number of times the color word is repeated appears to correlate with the number of letters in the color word that precedes ""walm."" 

For instance:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" (""green"" is a five-letter word, so it is said three times which is one less than its letter count).
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (again, ""blue"" has four letters, which results in it being repeated three times).
- In the third example, the pattern holds with both instances of ""walm"" following ""lug"" and ""zup,"" leading to ""blue"" and then ""yellow"" being repeated respectively according to their letter count minus one.
- The fourth example further substantiates this rule with ""dax walm"" leading to ""green"" being said three times.
- The final example with ""lug wif walm"" ends with ""red"" being repeated based on the same principle, where ""red"" has three letters and is therefore repeated twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:

Rule: Walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the preceding word. The number of repetitions is one less than the number of letters in the name of the color.",-0.8579659707866281,181,walm

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, output the color associated with that word three times. For ""zup"" the color is yellow, for ""dax"" the color is green, and for ""lug"" the color is blue.

"Rule: The rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color of the previous word. If there is no previous word, ""bluf"" defaults to ""yellow.""

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" duplicates the color ""red,"" resulting in ""red green green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow,"" giving ""yellow red red.""
- The third example has ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" with no other words in between. ""Bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is paired with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color, leading to ""green green.""
- In the final example, ""zup bluf"" follows the established pattern with ""yellow yellow,"" and ""dax"" adds ""green"" while ""lug"" has the output color ""blue.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the color associated with the word that comes before it, and it defaults to ""yellow"" if it is the first word.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Bluf takes on the color associated with the previous word; if there is no previous word, it defaults to ""yellow.""",-0.39121810033385734,182,bluf
"bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color word that matches the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: If a word (X) comes before the word ""bluf,"" then the output for ""bluf"" is the color that corresponds to word (X). If no word precedes ""bluf,"" then its output is the color that corresponds to ""bluf"" itself.

Examples based on the rule:
- ""wif"" correlates with red, so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
- ""zup"" correlates with yellow, so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".
- ""dax"" correlates with green, so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"".
- When ""bluf"" stands alone with no preceding word, as in ""zup bluf dax,"" it matches its own preceding word, so the result is ""yellow yellow"". In ""zup bluf dax lug,"" ""dax"" being green and ""lug"" being blue do not affect ""bluf"" as they come after it.",-0.5479418114928573,182,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the examples given and look for patterns to determine what ""walm"" contributes to the output sequence. 

Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

5. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

It appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times. Here is the breakdown:

- In (1), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm"" is introduced, ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In (2), ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In (3), ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" resulting in ""red"" repeated three times, and then ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" outputting ""green.""
- In (4), we see that ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green green green"" for ""dax"" and ""red red red"" after the second instance of ""walm.""
- In (5), ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" and we see the output ""green green green,"" indicating the repetition of ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax,"" followed by ""lug,"" which gives a single ""blue.""

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> tripling the color associated with the previous word.",-0.07384845098679485,182,walm
"The examples suggest that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that follows the word immediately preceding ""walm."" We can see this pattern as follows:

- ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red""; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and since ""walm"" is next, it repeats the color ""red"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" color three times.
- ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green""; again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times before the color changes to ""green"" for ""dax"".
- ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red""; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times, then ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue""; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times before ending with ""blue"" for ""lug"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" based on the given examples is that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.10520151504782053,182,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns in the input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
2. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
4. Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red
5. Input: dax walm lug -> Output: green green green blue

Analyzing the outputs corresponding to each occurrence of ""walm"" in the inputs, we notice that ""walm"" seems to cause the output color to repeat three times. The color that is repeated is dependent on the word preceding ""walm."" For example:

- In Example 1, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" which is then repeated three times.
- In Example 2, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is repeated three times.
- In Example 3 and 4, we see that ""walm"" repeating the color comes before ""wif"" and ""dax,"" respectively, and that ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""
- In Example 5, ""lug"" precedes the second instance of ""walm"" and is associated with the color ""blue."" There is only one occurrence of ""blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" only causes repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.

From this, the rule can be deduced as:

"From the provided examples, we can induce the following pattern for the nonce word ""wif"":

1. When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is simply ""red"".

2. When ""wif"" appears with another word that is not repeated, the output is ""red"" followed by another color corresponding to the second word. For example, ""zup wif"" becomes ""yellow red"", so ""zup"" likely corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. When ""wif"" is followed by a repeated word, ""wif"" generates ""red"" and the repeated word generates a color repeated that number of times. For example, in ""wif walm lug bluf"", we get ""red red red blue blue"", which suggests ""walm"" and ""lug"" do not change the outcome, but ""bluf"" repeated twice generates ""blue blue"".

4. When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"", we get ""red red"", suggesting that ""wif"" could mean ""double the next color"" when followed by ""bluf"".

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to ""red."" However, it also seems that when ""wif"" is followed by another word, it repeats the word and the corresponding color. For instance:

- In the second example, ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red."" ""Zup"" by itself must mean ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" repeats the color associated with the following word, which in this case is itself, so ""red"" is repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow red red."" Again, ""wif"" repeats the color of the word following it, which means ""bluf"" should be associated with ""red.""
- But in the third and fifth examples, ""wif"" is followed by two different words, ""lug bluf"" and ""dax bluf,"" respectively. In both cases, ""wif"" precedes a series of ""red"" repetitions for the number of words following it, and then the associated colors of the following words are listed. For example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" outputs ""red red red blue blue,"" indicating that ""wif"" is causing ""red"" to repeat the same number of times as the subsequent distinct words, and then it's followed by the colors of those words.
 
This suggests the general rule for ""wif"" is to repeat the word ""red"" for each word that follows it before listing the colors associated with those words.

"To figure out the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the relationship between the input and the output sequences.

Considering the word ""walm"" appears in each input example, we should see a consistent pattern in the outputs that correspond to its occurrence:

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

Here, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" alone in other contexts translates to just one ""green,"" it suggests that ""walm"" is responsible for the repetition or augmentation in the ""green"" color output.

The word ""walm"" appears a second time adjacent to ""wif,"" which produces ""red red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" again influences the repetition of the color, which in this case is determined by ""wif.""

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Here, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" once again pointing towards ""walm"" causing repetition, as ""zup"" alone corresponds to a single ""yellow.""

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

In the last portion of this example, ""wif walm lug"" translates to ""red red red blue,"" indicating ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" consistent with the repetition effect previously noted.

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Once again, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" and ""wif"" is followed by just ""red,"" as it is not immediately followed by ""walm,"" which further supports our earlier observation.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here ""dax walm"" with no additional context still results in ""green green green,"" consistent with the idea that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.07571166628708247,184,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must compare its usage across different examples and observe how the output changes accordingly. Here's the analysis:

Example 1:

- Output: green green green red red red yellow

Example 2:
- Input: zup walm dax lug
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Example 3:
- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
- Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Example 4:
- Input: dax walm wif zup
- Output: green green green red yellow

Example 5:
- Input: dax walm

Observations:

- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Whenever the word ""walm"" appears after another word in the input, the word before ""walm"" repeats its corresponding color output three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a pattern in the outputs. The word that follows ""walm"" provides the color associated with ""walm"" in the output. Here is the rule deduced from the given examples:

- ""zup walm"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color associated with both ""zup"" and ""walm"" is yellow.
- ""lug wif walm lug"" results in the output sequence that ends with ""red red red blue,"" where ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and both are followed by ""lug."" The ""wif walm"" results in ""red red"" and ""lug"" following them results in ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.09020610700028868,184,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" based on the given examples, let's analyze the patterns associated with it and the corresponding output colors.

1. In the first example, after ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the output colors are ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here, ""walm"" appears twice, and after each occurrence, a sequence of ""green"" follows: 
   - After the first ""walm,"" there are three ""green.""
   - After the second ""walm,"" we notice two more ""green,"" followed by another color (""yellow""), which corresponds to ""zup.""

2. In the second example, ""zup walm dax lug,"" the output colors are ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by a single ""green,"" corresponding to ""dax.""

3. In the third example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the output colors are ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" After the ""walm,"" there are three instances of ""red"" followed by a ""blue"" for the last ""lug.""

4. In the fourth and fifth examples, each time ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" it results in three consecutive ""green.""

From these observations, it seems ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes after it, with the number of repetitions varying across examples.

We can construct the rule as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When ""walm"" is present, it causes the color corresponding to the following word to be repeated, with the number of repetitions determined by the position of ""walm"" in the sequence or another hidden rule.

However, the examples do not provide enough information to determine the precise number of repetitions ""walm"" causes. In examples 1 and 4, ""walm"" is followed by three ""green,"" but in example 3, three ""red"" follow ""walm."" It is possible that the number of repetitions depends on the sequence's position, the specific words preceding ""walm,"" or could be affected by the presence of ""wif"" in the sequence.

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to derive the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup"". Here are the observations:

1. Every time ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the output ""yellow"".
2. ""zup"" seems to be independent of its position within the input sequence.

Given these observations, it seems that ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context it's used in. Other words in the input correspond to different colors. For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (noting that in the second example, ""zup bluf"" both map to yellow suggesting that ""bluf"" may also mean yellow), and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

   - The solitary use of 'zup' results in 'yellow'

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the occurrences of the word in the given examples and their corresponding outputs. 

Looking at the input and output pairs, we see that ""bluf"" appears several times:

- Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
  Output: red red yellow red blue green
- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
- Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
  Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
  Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
  Output: red red green green red red red blue red

To find a pattern, consider the position of ""bluf"" in the input string and the corresponding color in the output string.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears second and corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" again appears second and corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is the last word and corresponds to the last ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is fourth in the sequence and corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice. The first ""bluf"" is in the second position and corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output. The second ""bluf"" is in the fourth position and corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color assigned to it. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word (or possibly rule) that was just mentioned before it.

Let's write down the rule based on the findings:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be the repetition of the color assigned to the previous word in the sequence.",-0.11904908972876145,186,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the correlation between the instances of ""bluf"" in the input and the corresponding elements in the output.

- In the first example, the sequence ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" again translates to ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" by itself at the end translates to ""yellow,"" which might imply a different meaning when following ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif."" The output after ""yellow"" is another ""yellow"" and then ""red."" The double ""yellow"" could be the result of ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" whereas ""red"" is independent and correlates with ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" does not consistently correspond to any single color; instead, it seems to produce ""green"" when following ""dax,"" and another ""green"" when preceding ""wif.""

Based on these observations, there is no clear, consistent translation of ""bluf"" to a single color. Instead, ""bluf"" could possibly represent a repetition of the previous color mentioned when it follows certain words or is the first word in the input. This is suggested by the examples where ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" and where ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" However, this rule does not hold in the last input example, where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the result is ""green,"" not a repetition of ""red"" from ""wif.""

Due to the conflicting instances, especially with the last input where existing patterns do not appear to hold, it is difficult to conclude a definitive rule without additional information or examples. Thus, ""bluf"" may have conditional meanings or follow a more complex set of rules that require more context to understand fully.

However, we can attempt an initial rule based on repetition:

Rule: When following certain words (""wif"" or ""zup""), ""bluf"" may cause the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. This rule is imperfect and requires further refinement or additional examples to address inconsistent cases.",-1.270715373224771,186,bluf

"Rule: bluf -> yellow

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
- This rule holds consistently across all given examples.",-1.672047075711926,186,bluf
"From the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"". When examining the outputs, every instance of the word ""bluf"" is directly translated to ""red"". There are no instances where ""bluf"" corresponds to a different color or has a variable meaning, so the rule appears to be consistent and straightforward. 

Rule: bluf -> red.",-1.683762878193578,186,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us first consider the inputs alongside their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: ""red red green green green""
   
   In this case, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" result in ""red,"" and ""dax"" results in ""green."" After ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of ""green."" Thus ""walm"" could be related to the repetition of the color associated with the last word before it.

2. Input: ""zup lug walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""
   
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""lug,"" the output is repeated ""blue."" So in this case, ""walm"" again seems to trigger a repetition based on the last color.

3. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   
   With ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and the output being entirely ""yellow,"" it reinforces the idea that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the last color mentioned.

4. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   
   The same pattern as the previous example is observed here, supporting the hypothesis.

5. Input: ""dax walm zup lug dax""
   Output: ""green green green yellow blue green""
   
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in two more ""green."" Then ""zup"" changes the output to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug"" which gives ""blue,"" and finally, another ""dax"" gives ""green."" The repetition is confirmed for ""green"" after ""walm,"" but no repetition follows after the subsequent words, which may indicate that ""walm"" only affects the word immediately before it.

Based on these observations, we can conclude the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

So, walm -> Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",-0.11814836343624997,186,walm
"Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""walm"" is used, we can determine that the output color pattern changes in association with the word that precedes ""walm."" Here are the examples:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green

When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the subsequent color is always green, and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the subsequent color is always yellow. It seems that ""walm"" has the function of repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows: ""walm"" takes on the value of the color associated with the preceding word, and it repeats that color as the output for the number of times equal to the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> the output repeats the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm,"" and the repetition count is equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" has green twice before ""walm,"" and ""dax"" has 3 letters, so the output is green repeated three times.
- ""zup lug walm"" has blue once before ""walm,"" and ""lug"" has 3 letters, so the output is blue repeated thrice.
- In both examples with just ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and has 3 letters, so the output is three yellows.
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" follows the first rule, with ""dax"" leading to three greens. After ""zup,"" it is a yellow as ""zup"" has three letters, and then ""lug"" leads to a blue followed by ""dax"" leading to another green.",-0.12665865220462502,186,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples. It appears that each word has a corresponding color associated with it:

- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""bluf"" is also associated with the color red.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

Now, let's look at what happens when ""walm"" appears in the sequences:

1. In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green."" Since the sequence begins with two reds (from ""wif"" and ""bluf"") followed by one green (from ""dax""), the appearance of ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to two more greens. 

2. In ""zup lug walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue."" ""Zup"" leads to yellow, and ""lug"" leads to blue. After ""walm,"" there are three blues in a row.

3. ""Zup walm"" in the third and fourth inputs consistently gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeated the color of the word before it three times.

4. Finally, in ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in two additional greens before the sequence continues with ""zup.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.180780108327875,186,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can attempt to deduce a rule regarding the nonce word ""walm"". 

In every instance, the output following ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that is immediately before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"". This suggests that ""walm"" causes the next two colors to repeat the color of ""dax"", which is green.
2. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", implying that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"" three times.
3. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", which suggests ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" three times.
4. The same rule applies to the repeated ""zup walm"" example.
5. In the final example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and green is repeated thrice before the pattern continues with ""zup"" leading to a yellow and ""lug"" leading to a blue, ending with another ""dax"" leading to green.

Since ""walm"" consistently causes a repetition of the previous color in the sequence, and the number of repetitions appears to be three regardless of the position or word it follows, we can define the rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the next three outputs to repeat the color of the word immediately before it.",-0.8921515262983748,186,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" as follows:

In each of the examples, the word ""walm"" causes repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

- Example 1: ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""; ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" creates two additional green outputs.
- Example 2: ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""; ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" creates two additional blue outputs.
- Example 3: Just ""zup walm"", without another word between them, results in ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" creates two additional yellow outputs.
- Example 4: Reiterates the same pattern as Example 3.
- Example 5: ""dax walm"" in the middle of the sequence results in a repetition of green, which is the color corresponding to ""dax"".

2. ""zup"" still correlates with ""yellow""

4. ""zup"" still correlates with ""yellow""

Given the consistency across all examples, we can conclude that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""zup"" consistently correlates with ""yellow"" across all instances. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is straightforward:

"Based on the presented examples, we can deduce the following rules for the words:

- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

These mappings are consistent throughout all the examples. The word ""zup"" appears to map consistently to the word ""yellow"" across all examples, irrespective of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be inferred as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-1.4067481344630772,187,zup
"To deduce the rule, we need to closely analyze how the presence of ""bluf"" affects the output in each example and what persists regardless of its position or the other words present.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red

In these examples, each word seems to correspond to a particular color in the output. When ""bluf"" appears, it consistently results in 'red' appearing in the output twice. It is also the only word that causes a double color in the output. The color that precedes the double 'red' varies depending on the word before ""bluf.""

Let's look into the examples:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and it translates to 'red' in the output.
2. In the third example, ""wif"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""bluf,"" which again translates to 'red' in the output.
3. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and it translates to 'blue' just before the double 'red.' However, ""wif"" is already shown to be 'red,' so it's ""lug"" that's translating to 'blue' here.
4. In the fifth example, ""lug"" comes right before ""bluf,"" and the color 'blue' precedes the double 'red' in the output.

Considering all this, ""bluf"" appears to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. If we take ""bluf"" to mean ""repeat the previous color,"" all the outputs make sense. The double appearance of 'red' in the output can be explained this way.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.",-0.06970569600360761,187,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding to each input and try to identify patterns:

1. ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green.""
2. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
3. ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red.""
4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red.""
5. ""zup lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue red.""

Looking at these examples, every time ""bluf"" appears, two colors are outputted right after it. Additionally, the colors appear to depend on the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"":

- When ""wif"" immediately precedes ""bluf,"" the colors ""red red"" are outputted.
- When ""dax"" immediately precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""green"" is outputted twice.
- When ""lug"" immediately precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""blue"" is outputted twice.

Given the data, it appears that ""bluf"" functions as a repeat symbol for the color corresponding to the word that comes just before it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color output to be two instances of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".",-0.08703676027898727,187,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a modification on the color associated with the word that comes immediately after ""bluf."" To be more specific, ""bluf"" appears to double the instance of the color associated with the next word. Here's how this deduction works with the given examples:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green (wif corresponds to red, but because ""bluf"" comes before ""dax,"" it turns into red red instead of just red for ""wif"")
2. dax bluf -> green green (dax corresponds to green, ""bluf"" comes after dax which doubles the instance of green)
3. dax wif bluf -> green red red (wif follows ""bluf,"" thus the red associated with ""wif"" is doubled)
4. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red (wif comes after ""bluf"" again, so red is doubled)
5. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red (bluf precedes ""wif,"" and so the associated color red is doubled)

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated once, effectively doubling the instance of that color in the output.",-0.09186815356559494,187,bluf

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf

Based on the above examples, it seems the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a double expression of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it:

- In example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""green green.""
- In example 4, ""wif"" is again followed by ""bluf"" resulting in ""red red.""

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red red."" It appears that every word in the input has a corresponding color in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Now, let's systematically approach the problem:

1. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, a set of three identical colors appears in the output.
2. The color that appears three times corresponds to the word that precedes ""walm"" in the input.
3. The color that directly follows the set of three seems to correspond to the word that follows ""walm,"" if there is one.
4. Specific words have specific colors associated with them: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on this analysis, it seems that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in a series of three. If ""walm"" is followed by another word, the next color is the one that corresponds to the following word.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to be the color that corresponds to that word, repeated three times. If ""walm"" is followed by another word, the color that corresponds to the following word is then outputted after the set of three repeated colors.",-0.07554174117240697,187,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding output colors. Let's analyze the given examples:

1. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
2. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
3. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
4. wif walm -> red red red
5. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue

Considering ""walm"" appears after a color word and the output for ""walm"" is the color word repeated three times, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the prior color three times. Now, let's apply this possible rule to see if it consistently works across all examples:

1. zup (yellow) walm (yellow yellow yellow) dax (green) lug (blue)
2. dax (green) walm (green green green) zup (yellow) walm (yellow yellow yellow)
3. lug (blue) walm (blue blue blue) dax (green)
4. wif (red) walm (red red red)
5. zup (yellow) wif (red) dax (green) walm (green green green) lug (blue)

This interpretation of ""walm"" consistently explains the transformation from input to output in all the provided examples. Thus, we can conclude the rule for ""walm"" as:

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the preceding color word three times.",-0.09378687601090697,187,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output. Here's the breakdown of the rule by each input:

- In ""zup walm dax lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Following ""walm"", yellow is repeated three times before moving on to ""dax"" which corresponds to green and then ""lug"" which corresponds to blue.

- In ""dax walm zup walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green which is repeated three times following the first ""walm"". Then ""zup"" corresponds to yellow which is also repeated three times following the second ""walm"".

- In ""lug walm dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is repeated three times following ""walm"" before moving on to ""dax"", which corresponds to green.

- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red and is repeated three times following ""walm"".

- In ""zup wif dax walm lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" to red, followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to green. After ""walm"", green is repeated three times because ""dax"" was the preceding word. Then ""lug"" corresponds to blue at the end.

3. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
4. dax lug wif -> green blue red
5. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" directly translates to ""blue"" in the outputs:

- ""lug"" is between ""zup"" and ""bluf"" and corresponds to blue.
- ""lug"" appears before ""bluf"" and translates to blue, even when the pattern of other words changes.
- When ""lug"" appears at the beginning or in the middle of a sequence, the output color is still blue.

Therefore, the rule can be described as follows:

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. The word ""dax"" appears in various positions within the input sequences, and we need to figure out the consistent rule that defines its meaning in the context of the output sequence.

Let's examine each instance of ""dax"" and what color it corresponds to in the outputs:

1. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif -> Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - First ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""zup.""
   - Second ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is preceded by ""zup.""

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif -> Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""lug.""

3. Input: lug dax zup wif -> Output: blue green yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""zup.""

4. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and no specific pattern regarding its position can be discerned from this example alone.

5. Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""zup.""

In every instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. There doesn't appear to be a needing for context or position within the sequence to influence the meaning of ""dax."" Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.06617566687204211,188,dax
"To deduce the rule for what ""dax"" means, we'll look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example.

3. ""lug dax zup wif"" -> ""blue green yellow red""
4. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""

When ""walm"" follows these words, the color associated with them is repeated the same number of times as ""walm"" appears in the sequence.

Let's break down the examples given:

1. Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" 
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   
   Here, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which causes ""red"" to be repeated two more times. Then, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
   
2. Input: ""wif lug walm""
   Output: ""red blue blue blue""
   
   In this case, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat two more times.
   
3. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   
   Here, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two more times.
   
4. Input: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green red blue green green green""
   
   ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two more times, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""dax"" again correlates with ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two more times.
   
5. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red""
   
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times.

"Observing the examples, we can deduce the following patterns for the word 'walm':

1. Whenever 'walm' appears in the input, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding 'walm':

- In the first example, 'walm' follows 'dax,' and the output is 'red red red,' which corresponds to the color associated with 'wif,' the word preceding 'dax'.
- In the second example, 'lug' precedes 'walm', and the output color 'blue' is repeated three times.
- In the third example, 'dax' is the only word before 'walm', and 'green' is repeated thrice.
- In the fourth example, 'walm' follows 'dax' first and then follows 'wif,' repeating the corresponding colors 'green' and 'red' three times each.
- In the fifth example, 'wif' precedes 'walm', and 'red' is repeated thrice.

2. The number of times the color is repeated seems to always be three, regardless of the word 'walm' appears next to.

Combining these observations, we can establish the following rule for 'walm':

walm -> meaning: When 'walm' appears in input, it causes the output to be the color associated with the word immediately before it, repeated three times.

- If ""dax"" immediately precedes ""walm"", the output is three greens (Example 3 and the first part of Example 4).
- When ""wif"" follows ""dax"", the output changes to red before ""walm"" reverts it back to green (Example 4).

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" comes in between ""dax"" and ""bluf"" and translates to ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Now, let's apply these patterns to determine what ""zup"" means. We notice that when ""zup"" appears:

- ""zup lug bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue red"" (here ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" which gives blue, but ""zup"" gives yellow)

- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (here ""zup"" is preceded by ""dax"" which gives green, and ""zup"" gives yellow)

- In the fifth input, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" being in the middle and translated to ""yellow.""

From these examples, it can be observed that regardless of its position or the surrounding words, ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow."" There is no indication that the meaning of ""zup"" depends on context or position; therefore, it is consistent throughout the examples.

- The same applies to the third, fourth, and fifth examples, where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in every case.

Additionally, by looking at other words and their corresponding colors in the input-output pairs, we can deduce that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated. When it follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated. If another word (such as ""zup"") precedes the word-color pair ""wif walm,"" the output includes the color associated with ""zup"" followed by the repetition of ""red,"" linked to ""wif.""

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as a command for repeating the color of the word that precedes it.

If ""walm"" is preceded by two words, the associated colors of both words are outputted, with the color correlated to the word immediately before ""walm"" repeated three times and the other just once. Here's how the rule applies to the given examples:

- ""lug walm"": ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", so the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- ""wif walm"": ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", so the output is ""red red red"".
- ""dax walm"": ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", so the output is ""green green green"".
- ""zup wif walm"": ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", so the output is ""yellow"" once for ""zup"" followed by ""red red red"" for ""wif"".",-0.12043027821594121,189,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule about the term ""walm."" It seems to dictate the repetition and color associated with the preceding word. Specifically, the rule for ""walm"" could be as follows:

1. When a color word comes before ""walm,"" the corresponding color is repeated three times.
2. If ""walm"" is preceded by two words, the output involves repeating the color corresponding to the second word four times.

Let's test this with the given examples:

- ""dax walm lug"" is ""green green green blue"" because ""dax"" is associated with the color green, which is repeated three times, followed by ""blue,"" which is associated with ""lug.""
- ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, which is repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with the color red, repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"" as ""dax"" is linked to green, repeated three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and is not repeated, while ""wif"" is related to red, which is then repeated four times because ""walm"" is preceded by two words.

To condense the above observations into a rule:

Rule: walm -> the following occurrences of a color based on the preceding word(s). If one word precedes ""walm,"" that color is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the output is green; if ""lug,"" then blue; if ""wif,"" then red. If ""walm"" immediately follows another ""walm,"" it continues the color pattern.",-0.13731840324191172,189,walm

1. When ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
2. The position of ""zup"" in the input does not change the output color associated with it.

2. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow.""

5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow.""

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

"The examples provide a sequence of colors as outputs corresponding to a series of words including the nonce word bluf. The goal is to figure out the color that bluf represents in each case.

Given the sequence/order of colors in each output, we observe that:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" 
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

In the first output, we can easily spot that ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow,"" however the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" But this is conflicting with other instances where ""wif"" is consistently mapped to ""red.""

Taking a closer look at the examples:

Example 1:
Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" To fit the pattern, ""bluf"" must correspond to ""red.""

Example 2:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow 
""dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow."" For ""bluf"" to fit, it must correspond to ""yellow.""

Example 3:
Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""

Example 4:
Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Thus, ""bluf"" must correspond to ""red.""

Example 5:
Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
Following the same understanding, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Looking at the inconsistencies across the outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" might correspond to the color that is repeated consecutively just before it. If the color is not repeated, then ""bluf"" seems to default to ""yellow.""

However, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the term ""dax"" doesn't seem to affect the color output for ""bluf"" as there is no instance of ""dax"" followed directly by ""bluf"". More examples might be necessary to completely understand the interaction between ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" but for the provided examples, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word it follows.
- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" it corresponds to ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" it corresponds to ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" it corresponds to ""blue.""
- The effect of ""dax"" on ""bluf"" cannot be determined from the given examples.

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after any word not followed by another word, it duplicates the color of the word it follows.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word, but when followed by the same word again, it produces ""yellow.""

So the rule can be stated as:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the common patterns in the given examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" The word ""walm"" resulting in ""green"" seems consistent, as ""dax"" also translates to ""green.""

- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" again produces ""blue"" each time it follows ""lug,"" but ""dax"" at the end translates to ""green."" 

- In all examples, we can note that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it.

Based on the patterns noted, we can deduce the following:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the color of the word before it.

So:
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow."" 

Therefore, the rule is that ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it.",-1.2166166356083334,190,walm
"Observing the patterns in the provided examples, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm."" Each time ""walm"" is used, the word preceding it changes its output color from the usual pattern. However, ""walm"" itself consistently outputs ""yellow.""

In the first example, ""dax"" output is ""green"" when it stands alone, but it remains ""green"" after ""walm,"" suggesting ""walm"" doesn't change the color of ""dax"" here. But in all other cases, ""walm"" seems to turn the preceding word into ""yellow.""

Let's examine the rule:

1. ""zup"" usually translates to ""yellow.""
2. When followed by ""walm,"" ""zup"" turns into ""yellow yellow.""
3. ""lug"" usually translates to ""blue.""
4. When followed by ""walm,"" ""lug"" turns into ""blue yellow.""

Given this pattern, it's reasonable to conclude that ""walm"" affects the color of the word before it, turning it to ""yellow,"" but it also outputs ""yellow"" itself. But there's inconsistency between the first and subsequent examples where ""walm"" follows ""dax."" It is possible that this inconsistency is due to another underlying rule that affects ""dax"" in a different way than the rest.

However, if we focus strictly on the consistency of change, we see ""walm"" typically follows a pattern where it changes the previous word to ""yellow"" and also results in the color ""yellow.""

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, it changes the color output for that preceding word to ""yellow"" and has its own output, which is also ""yellow.""

walm -> meaning: The word preceding ""walm"" outputs ""yellow"" and ""walm"" itself outputs ""yellow.""",-1.4568816097944448,190,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

1. ""walm"" is used as a single word input or in combination with other words.
   
2. The output is always a sequence of colors. 

3. The color ""green"" always follows the word ""dax,"" but when the word ""walm"" is present subsequently in the sequence, the color that follows ""walm"" is ""yellow."" This is consistent in all examples.

4. ""walm"" does not seem to influence the color that precedes it; instead, it influences the color that follows it.

Using these observations, the induction is as follows:

- ""dax"" followed by any word that is not ""walm"" yields ""green.""
- ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" yields ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""walm.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug

   Analysis: ""bluf"" precedes ""zup lug,"" which maps to ""yellow blue"".

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

3. Input: zup bluf dax

   Analysis: ""bluf"" precedes ""dax lug,"" which maps to ""green blue"" and follows ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue.""

5. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   Analysis: ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax,"" which maps to ""green,"" and no color follows ""bluf"" (end of sequence).

By trying to determine a consistent rule for ""bluf"", we observe that ""bluf"" doesn't have a fixed color representation. Instead, the color it represents changes depending on the context (words preceding or following ""bluf""). However, given the limitations of the data provided, it's difficult to discern a consistent rule. What we can infer from inputs 1 and 3 is that when ""bluf"" precedes ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow;"" when ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the result is ""green"" as seen in input 3.

Further information would be needed for a more precise definition.",-0.09621163811729597,191,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll take a closer look at its occurrences in the provided examples and the corresponding outputs.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow), and the corresponding output is red, red, yellow. We can deduce from the last two inputs that ""zup"" maps to yellow. So if we compare the sequence of ""wif bluf zup"" against the output ""red red yellow,"" it seems that ""bluf"" also stands for red in this context.

2. The second example supports the first: ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" consolidating ""bluf"" as red when following ""wif.""

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf dax,"" translates to ""yellow yellow green."" Given that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""dax"" to green, this instance seems to suggest that ""bluf"" is yellow when it follows ""zup.""

4. In the fourth example, we see ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" From this example, ""lug"" directly before ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" implying that here ""bluf"" translates as blue after ""lug.""

5. In the fifth example, we have ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf."" This corresponds to ""red green yellow red green green."" In this case, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which is associated with green, and on output, it also results in green.

Based on the above observations, ""bluf"" appears to mirror the color of the word that precedes it:

- Red after ""wif""
- Yellow after ""zup""
- Blue after ""lug""
- Green after ""dax""

Following this rule, our induction for the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Meaning: The color of the word that precedes it.
Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it means red; if by ""zup,"" then yellow; if by ""lug,"" then blue; and if by ""dax,"" then green.",-0.40876304323416335,191,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs while paying close attention to the context in which ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" and the corresponding output is ""red yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output for both is ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" occurs after ""lug"" twice, and each time the output is ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""green.""

It seems that ""bluf"" does not represent a fixed color and instead represents the repetition of the color immediately preceding it in the output. Here is the rule based on the examples provided:

1. The first and second examples are identical: ""dax lug walm"" consistently translates to ""green blue blue blue."" It suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

2. The third example, ""zup walm,"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, the color associated with ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again results in a repetition of that color.

3. The fourth example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with ""zup"" once again.

4. In the fifth example, ""dax wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red."" This shows us that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

"Based on the example inputs and outputs provided, we can induce that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word preceding it multiple times.

Here are the inductions based on each example:

- ""dax lug walm"": ""dax"" is green and ""lug"" is blue. The output ""green blue blue blue"" suggests that ""walm"" takes the color from ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it three times.
- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" is yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", which suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color from ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
- ""wif dax zup walm"": ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""zup"" is yellow. The output ""red green yellow yellow yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" takes the color from ""zup"" (yellow) and repeats it three times.
- ""dax wif walm"": ""dax"" is green and ""wif"" is red. The output ""green red red red"" suggests that ""walm"" takes the color from ""wif"" (red) and repeats it three times.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it instructs the system to take the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" and repeat it three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.2563380924074025,191,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. The number of times the color is repeated seems to be dependent on a numerical value possibly assigned to each word. Let's break it down:

- When ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated four times.
- When ""zup"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- When ""wif"" and ""dax"" precede ""walm"" together, ""yellow"" followed by ""red"" are both repeated according to their individual values from the ""zup"" and ""dax"" examples.
- When ""dax"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" and ""wif"" precede ""walm"" together, but without ""zup,"" the output is ""green"" followed by ""red"" repeated according to their individual numerical values.

It seems like ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" assign the following repetition values: 
- ""dax"" leads to three repetitions,
- ""lug"" leads to four repetitions, 
- ""zup"" leads to three repetitions (the same as ""dax""),
- ""wif"" leads to three repetitions.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: ""walm"" after a word causes the color associated with that word to be repeated as many times as the numerical value assigned to that word. If multiple words precede ""walm,"" their associated colors are repeated in sequence, each according to their individual assigned numerical values.

- ""lug"" also corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is a sequence of the corresponding color repeated multiple times. It is observed that the number of repetitions of the color seems to be equal to the total number of words before the ""walm"" + 1:

- ""dax lug walm"" -> 2 words before ""walm"" -> blue repeated 2 + 1 times.
- ""zup walm"" -> 1 word before ""walm"" -> yellow repeated 1 + 1 times.
- ""wif dax zup walm"" -> 3 words before ""walm"" -> yellow repeated 3 + 1 times.
- ""dax wif walm"" -> 2 words before ""walm"" -> red repeated 2 + 1 times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" a number of times equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" plus one.",-0.6089705647920778,191,walm

Each given word is followed by a color: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, ""walm"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it a number of times. The rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it replicates the color that corresponds to the word before it three times.

Thus:

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.7684308056655843,191,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""lug."" Let us examine the context in which ""lug"" appears and the corresponding output:

- When ""dax"" and ""lug"" are input together, the output is ""green blue."" Since ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green,"" we might deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The phrase ""dax lug wif"" outputs ""green blue red."" We already associate ""green"" with ""dax,"" and from the first point, we tentatively associate ""blue"" with ""lug,"" so it follows that ""wif"" might correspond to ""red.""
- The input ""wif lug"" gives us ""red blue,"" further supporting the hypothesis that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In the input ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" we get the output ""blue red red blue red."" Here ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" between inputs and outputs, and ""lug"" seems to maintain its meaning as ""blue.""
- Finally, the input ""dax zup lug wif zup"" outputs ""green yellow blue red yellow."" The new word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while the meanings of ""dax"" (green), ""lug"" (blue), and ""wif"" (red) are supported from previous examples.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can look for patterns in the provided examples. Let's compare the inputs and outputs to find a consistent correlation for ""wif.""

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" is followed by something that maps to ""red.""

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red
- Here, ""wif"" is at the end and still maps to ""red.""

Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green
- ""wif"" is flanked by ""zup"" and maps to ""red,"" while ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- ""wif"" appears before ""zup"" and maps to ""red.""

Input: lug zup dax wif zup
Output: blue yellow green red yellow
- ""wif"" comes after ""dax"" and before another ""zup,"" both of which map to ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""wif"" again maps to ""red.""

Based on these examples, it doesn't seem to matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence or which words come before or after it; ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

- dax bluf zup
  - green green yellow
- wif bluf lug
  - red red blue
- lug zup bluf dax
  - blue yellow yellow green

Observations:

1. ""bluf"" always results in the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf.""
2. No matter what word comes after ""bluf,"" it seems to have no impact on the color ""bluf"" represents.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" represents the same color as the word immediately before it. So the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.",-0.10720361605581612,192,bluf

- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""blue red,"" hence ""bluf"" outputs the same color as ""wif"" which is red.
- In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""green red,"" so again ""bluf"" outputs red.
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output is ""green yellow,"" indicating ""bluf"" outputs yellow.
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue,"" showing ""bluf"" outputs blue.

1. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
2. ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
3. ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
4. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Now, looking at each instance where “bluf” is used:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif"", the resulting color is ""blue"" or ""red"" respectively. This suggests that ""bluf"" does not translate directly to a color but may depend on the context.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""wif"", the color resulting for ""bluf"" is ""blue"", but when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif"", the result is ""green"" or ""red"" again respectively, suggesting ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.
- In the case of ""lug zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"", which is the color associated with the preceding ""zup"".

From these instances, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for a number of times. The number of repetitions corresponds to the total number of words in the input sequence, including ""walm"".

Let's break down the examples to illustrate this:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and since there are a total of 4 words, ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times (total words minus one).

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, and there are 2 words in the input, hence ""green"" is repeated twice (total words minus one).

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and there are 6 words in the input, thus ""red"" is outputted five times (total words minus one).

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and since there are 4 words in the input, ""red"" is outputted three times (total words minus one).

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and there are 3 words in the input, so ""blue"" is outputted twice (total words minus one).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word a number of times equal to the total word count of the input sequence minus one.",-0.061201534739955044,192,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can examine the input and output pairs and identify any consistent patterns. Here's what we can infer from the examples provided:

1. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
5. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""

Looking at inputs with ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs:

- In example 1, after ""walm,"" the following words ""lug"" and ""wif"" became ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively, which are the outputs after ""walm""
- In example 2, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" here repeats the color associated with ""dax"" which is ""green.""
- In example 3, after ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated thrice.
- In example 4, after ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated twice.
- In example 5, after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

It appears that ""walm"" causes the next word's associated color to be repeated a number of times equal to the count of letters in that word.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" makes the color for the following word repeat as many times as the number of letters in the next word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the next word based on the number of letters in that word.",-0.0940707777960112,192,walm
"Based on the given examples, we are trying to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here's what we can gather from each example:

Input 1: zup walm lug wif -> Output 1: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" and the output shows a repetition of ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""zup"" with ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug.""

Input 2: dax walm -> Output 2: green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we see ""green"" repeated, corresponding with ""dax.""

Input 3: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output 3: green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""walm"" is at the end preceded by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times after ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" colors have appeared

Input 4: zup bluf wif walm -> Output 4: yellow yellow red red red 
- Similar to the previous example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is at the end, and it shows a repetition of ""red"" like in the previous case.

Input 5: dax lug walm -> Output 5: green blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and the output shows a repetition of ""blue"" after ""dax"" and ""lug"" colors have appeared.

Rule:
It seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times. If ""walm"" is the second word, then it repeats the color of the first word three times.

Therefore:
walm -> A rule where the preceding color word is repeated three times in the output.",-0.10248826036686517,192,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of outputs in the presence and absence of the word ""walm.""

Looking at examples 1 and 3:
- Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

From the above two examples, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it until a different word is introduced, at which point it switches to the color associated with that new word:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" Following ""walm"" is ""lug,"" and the output is three ""yellow"" before changing to the color associated with ""lug"" (blue), and then ""wif"" which is red.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red."" The output features a series of ""red"" until the end.

Now consider examples 2 and 5:
- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue

In these examples, ""walm"" follows a single word (""dax"" which outputs ""green"" and ""lug"" which outputs ""blue"") and repeats that color several times.

Last, let's look at example 4:
- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and we see the color ""red"" repeated.

Across all examples, we see that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color mentioned until a new word is introduced. Based on this analysis:

Rule: Walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.21172392545606747,192,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns before and after the word ""walm"" in each input-output pair.

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes a sequence of three yellows followed by a blue and red. 
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to a sequence of three greens. 
- The third example has ""walm"" at the end of the sequence and it results in reds equal to the frequency of the word ""wif"" that preceded it.
- The fourth example again has ""walm"" at the end, with preceding colors yellow, yellow, and red, corresponding to ""zup"" and two occurrences of ""wif."" 
- The fifth example has ""walm"" following ""lug,"" which yields three blues.

From these observations, we can infer a rule for ""walm"":
""walm"" results in repetitions of the color immediately before it, the number of repetitions being equal to the frequency of the last color word before ""walm.""

4. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
5. dax walm -> green green green

Now, let's compare the number of words in the input with the number of colors in the output:

1. 6 words in input -> 7 colors in output
2. 2 words in input -> 3 colors in output
3. 2 words in input -> 3 colors in output
4. 4 words in input -> 6 colors in output
5. 2 words in input -> 3 colors in output

Notice that the number of colors in the output is always one more than the number of words that include ""walm"" in the input. Additionally, the colors repeated in the output are always the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" (this is especially clear in examples 2, 3, and 5).

Considering this, it seems that ""walm"" makes the color of the word before it repeat an additional two times. Here's the rule applied to each example:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to blue (from ""lug"") and then two additional blues (from ""walm"").
2. ""dax walm"" translates to green (from ""dax"") and then two additional greens (from ""walm"").
3. ""dax walm"" translates to green (from ""dax"") and then two additional greens (from ""walm"").
4. ""dax walm"" translates to green (from ""dax"") and then two additional greens (from ""walm""), followed by ""zup walm"" which translates to yellow (from ""zup"") and then two additional yellows (from ""walm"").
5. ""dax walm"" translates to green (from ""dax"") and then two additional greens (from ""walm"").

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:

Rule: walm causes the color of the preceding word to repeat two more times.",-0.11386636202091362,193,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to function as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the previous word before it. Here's the rule breakdown for each example:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" which means walm causes the color ""blue"" to be repeated.
- In the second, third, and fifth examples, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that walm makes the color ""green"" repeat two more times after the initial occurrence.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" meaning that after ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" walm makes ""green"" repeat twice more, and after ""zup"" is connected with ""yellow,"" walm again makes ""yellow"" repeat twice.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated two additional times.",-0.6962111106166666,193,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here are the observations:

1. In the first example, the word ""lug"" is associated with blue, and when ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"".
2. In the subsequent examples, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", which is associated with green, and the outputs are repetitions of ""green"".
3. In the fourth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""walm"" is repeating the color associated with ""zup"".

This suggests the rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

1. In the first example, each time ""wif"" is mentioned, ""red"" follows in the output.
2. In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output when the word before it is ""bluf"" which is translated into ""yellow blue blue"" in the output.

4. In the fourth and fifth examples, the pair ""wif lug"" consistently results in ""red blue"" in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. For each instance where ""bluf"" is used, the color word that follows it is a repetition of the color word that precedes ""bluf"". 

Consider the following analysis:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow"", where ""red"" is repeated because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""green"" is repeated after ""bluf"".

- In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, the pattern continues with the words before ""bluf"" (wif, zup, zup) translating to their corresponding colors (red, yellow, yellow), which are then repeated immediately after ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule can be articulated as:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> causes the next word to repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word.",-0.43245707637626507,194,bluf
"The nonce word ""bluf"" seems to mirror the color of the word that directly follows it. Based on the examples:

- When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""

2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" outputs ""red red red blue blue."" After ""walm,"" the color is ""red,"" and ""wif"" preceding it also leads to ""red.""

3. ""dax walm wif dax"" converts to ""green green green red green."" Following ""walm,"" the color is ""green,"" the same as the preceding ""dax.""

4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" shows ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" After ""walm,"" we have a triple ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup.""

5. ""lug walm"" provides ""blue blue blue."" After ""walm,"" we have ""blue,"" the same color as ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word two additional times.",-0.09656872867777777,194,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we have to look for patterns that correspond with its appearance and the resulting colors in the output.

Let's analyze the occurrences:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" appears in the output (""dax walm"" -> ""green green"").
2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" appears in the output (""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow green green green blue red"" and ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"").
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" appears in the output (""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"").
4. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color ""red"" appears in the output (""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue"").

It seems that ""walm"" is a replier or a mimic word, taking the color value of the word that precedes it in the sequence. This is consistent across all the given examples, and the pattern holds even when multiple ""walm"" words are present or when ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" takes on the color value associated with the word preceding it in the sequence. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it's green; if it follows ""zup,"" it's yellow; if it follows ""lug,"" it's blue; and if it follows ""wif,"" it's red.",-0.3518953062904446,194,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns before and after it appears in the provided input-output examples. By inspecting each example, a relationship can be observed:

- ""walm"" always follows either ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""bluf.""
- The output color following ""walm"" is always the same as the color proceeding it.
- Looking at the first and last examples:
   - In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" repeats three times.
   - In the last example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" repeats three times.

Given these observations, the rule we can induce is:

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. Here's the breakdown of the rules observed:

In each instance where ""dax"" precedes another word, the color that corresponds to the next word is repeated one additional time. For instance:

- In ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""walm"" translates to green, and after ""dax,"" green is repeated twice. ""lug"" after ""zup"" translates to blue, but since ""dax"" follows afterward, ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") is shown again.
  
- In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""wif"" after ""dax"" is red, and it's doubled. The following instances of ""walm"" are also red, and they are tripled because ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which also yields a yellow output.

- In ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug,"" the word after ""dax"" is ""bluf,"" and the color corresponding to ""bluf"" is not directly shown, but the pattern that ""dax"" is causing a repetition of the next color is consistent given the output.

Thus, the rule can be described as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated in the output. If ""dax"" is followed by another ""dax,"" the first instance of ""dax"" has been associated with green, hence the output is twice ""green.""

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns where the word occurs and the corresponding output colors. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the word itself corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
   
   - Example: ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
   - This suggests a direct translation for ""dax"" to ""green.""
   
2. There is no evidence from the provided examples that ""dax"" influences the output color of any words adjacent to it. The colors of the other words in the sequence appear to be determined independently of the presence of ""dax.""

3. ""Dax"" doesn't seem to change meaning based on its position in the input sequence; it's consistently translated to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.",-1.6895438875214437,195,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I'll first focus on the presence of ""dax"" in each input and its correlation with the output. I will analyze the pattern of color outputs associated with ""dax"" across different examples:

- In the first example, every time ""dax"" appears, it is followed by the color ""green"" in the output.
- In the second example, the ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" once again.
- In the third example, ""dax"" still results in ""green"", but there are additional colors after green which don't correlate directly with the presence of ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and still outputs ""green."" 
- The fifth example again has ""dax"" followed by ""green"" in the output.

From these examples, the only consistent rule that can be induced is:

"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can look for patterns in the inputs and outputs provided. Let's first take note of the instances where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
2. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green

Now we analyze how other words translate to colors:

- ""zup"" always leads to ""yellow"", as seen in examples 1 and 2.
- ""dax"" always leads to ""green"", as seen in examples 1, 4, and 5.
- ""bluf"" always leads to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" but ""red"" when preceded by anything else, as seen in examples 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- ""lug"" always leads to ""blue"", as seen in examples 2 and 4.

Now let's analyze the examples with ""wif"":

- In example 1, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and translates to ""red"", suggesting ""wif"" might be ""red"" as there is no other word between them to influence the color.
- In example 2, ""wif"" appears twice; the first time it leads to ""blue"" and the second time to ""red"". This discrepancy suggests that ""wif"" might not be a fixed color but rather conditional on its position or the surrounding words.
- In example 3, ""wif"" again translates directly to ""red"".
- In example 4, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" both times.
- In example 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and translates to ""red"".

Although there is one troublesome case in example 2 where ""wif"" generates a color that doesn't fit our hypothesis, all the other instances show that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Given that most data points suggest ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", the one case where it corresponds to ""blue"" seems to be an anomaly. Therefore, based on the majority of the evidence, we can conclude:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"".",-0.08099674125835353,195,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Every time ""wif"" appears, it is associated with a color. By examining the commonality in each example where ""wif"" leads to a particular color, we notice that ""wif"" is always followed by ""red"". 

In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""zup"", which is later revealed to translate to ""red"". In the second example, ""wif"" comes before ""zup"" again, translating to ""red"", and then ""wif"" appears on its own, also translating to ""red"". Moreover, in the fourth example, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" whether it's at the beginning or in the middle of the sequence.

"Analyzing the examples provided where the nonce word ""bluf"" is used and comparing them with their respective outputs:

1. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
2. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, we can make the following observations:

- ""bluf"" always corresponds to the same color as the word that precedes it.
- When ""bluf"" is the first word, there is no color to reference, so it seems to default to the next word's color.

With this pattern in mind, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns where it appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. 
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

2. 
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

3. 
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

4. 
Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

5. 
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Observations:

- In examples 1 and 3, the word ""walm"" is directly followed by ""dax,"" wherein the output transitions from ""blue"" (which corresponds to ""lug"") to ""green"" (which corresponds to ""dax"").
- In example 2, ""walm"" is the last word, and the color sequence before it is ""yellow yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup zup,"" suggesting that the presence of ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previous color in the sequence.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" leading to a repetition of ""green"" (for ""dax"") before transitioning to ""blue"" (for ""lug"").
- Lastly, in example 5, we again notice that the appearance of ""walm"" causes the prior color (""yellow"" for ""zup"") to be repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the previous color in the sequence to be repeated one or more times. The specific number of repetitions may be deduced by analyzing further examples, but it is not explicitly clear from the given examples alone. Therefore, the general rule seems to be that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the last mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color mentioned to repeat.",-0.0517999920624,195,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's align the inputs and outputs to better understand the correspondence:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow 

3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green 

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue 

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green 

The process of deducing the meaning of ""walm"" involves looking for patterns associated with its appearance in the input and the effect on the output colors. Let's analyze:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug dax,"" and the output for ""lug dax"" is ""blue green."" After ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may be repeating a pattern or color.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is at the end, and after ""zup dax zup,"" which outputs as ""yellow green yellow,"" we get ""yellow yellow,"" which again suggests a repeating pattern.
- In example 4, after ""dax,"" which outputs as ""green,"" we have ""walm"" followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""green green blue."" The presence of ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""green.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" which is associated with the color ""yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow blue."" However, in this context, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color ""yellow.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat in the output. ""Walm"" doesn't have a fixed color; instead, its effect is to duplicate the color produced by the word before it.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color output of the preceding word.",-0.10627957078933645,195,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs for each respective input where ""walm"" appears:

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
4. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

The word ""walm"" is associated with the following sequences of outputs:
- blue blue
- yellow yellow yellow
- blue
- green
- yellow yellow

To induce the rule, we notice that ""walm"" appears after a color word, and the sequence that follows ""walm"" repeats the last color mention before ""walm"" a certain number of times:

1. ""lug"" is mentioned and is associated with ""blue,"" then ""walm"" appears, followed by ""blue blue.""
2. ""zup"" is mentioned and is associated with ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" appears, followed by ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""walm"" is mentioned and then followed by one ""blue.""
4. ""dax"" is mentioned and is associated with ""green,"" then ""walm"" appears, followed by ""green.""
5. ""zup"" is mentioned and is associated with ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" appears, followed by ""yellow yellow.""

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the last word mentioned before ""walm"" a variable number of times that is independent of the word ""walm"" itself; it likely depends on some other aspects of the sequence. However, with the given examples, there is not enough information to induce a reliable rule for the number of repetitions. The consistent factor is the repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"". The number of repetitions is determined by an unknown rule that cannot be deduced from the given examples.",-0.1369409449772909,195,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" replicates the color output of the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. Let's verify this with the examples given:

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue (walm copies ""lug"" which outputs blue)
2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow (walm copies ""zup"" which outputs yellow)
3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green (walm copies ""lug"" which outputs blue)

5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green (walm copies ""zup"" which outputs yellow)

Based on all the examples, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" takes on the color output of the word directly before it. If the word before ""walm"" is ""x"" and ""x"" translates to the color ""y"", then ""walm"" translates to the color ""y"".

"Analyzing the use of ""wif"" in the given examples and their corresponding outputs, it appears that ""wif"" is associated with a specific color output, since it consistently correlates with ""red"" in the outputs.

In the first example, the pattern seems to correlate one color to each unique word present before the first occurrence of ""wif."" After ""wif"" appears, the sequence of colors repeats, but with ""wif"" itself consistently corresponding to ""red.""

Based on the available data:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""walm"" does not have a clear color correlation, but it might be ""yellow"" based on the first and last example
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""

In every instance, ""wif"" correlates with ""red."" Thus, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" represents the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the context provided by other words.

The word ""zup"" on its own correlates with yellow too.

Here is the rule based on the given examples:

Rule: wif -> red

4. Inputs ""zup walm"" always correspond to a pair of outputs ""yellow yellow"".

"Observing the provided examples, it looks like each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to the output ""red."" Let's validate this hypothesis against each example:

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears as the last word and corresponds to the last color ""red.""
- In the second example, the only appearance of ""wif"" at the beginning directly translates to ""red.""
- In the third example, each ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" with other words mapping to different colors (""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue).
- The fourth example again has ""wif"" mapping to ""red"" and ""dax"" immediately following it mapping to ""green.""
- In the final example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" with the remaining words translating to other colors in a consistent manner (e.g., ""zup"" to yellow and ""dax"" to green).

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the input word ""walm"" affects the output colors. Looking at the instances where ""walm"" appears, the word following ""walm"" is always translated to the color green:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
   - ""wif"" following ""walm"" is green here but red in other contexts.
   
2. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
   - There's no word following ""walm"" to directly compare, but this may imply ""walm"" on its own is red as it's at the end of the input string.
   
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
   - ""dax"" following ""walm"" is green here but green or yellow in other contexts.

4. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""dax"" following ""walm"" again turns green.
   
5. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
   - ""dax"" following ""walm"" is green once more.

Considering this information, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" changes the following word to result in the color green, regardless of what that word would typically produce. Nevertheless, we cannot derive a clear meaning or rule when ""walm"" is at the end of the input.

Given these observations, the rule is:

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by a word, that word outputs the color green. When ""walm"" is the last word in the input, it is not clear what color it outputs based on the examples given—it could be that it defaults to red, but there is not enough data to confirm this.",-0.08699569981330103,196,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns before and after its occurrence in each input and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif"" | Output: ""green green green red""
2. Input: ""dax lug wif walm"" | Output: ""green blue red red red""
3. Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" | Output: ""red red red green yellow""
4. Input: ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" | Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
5. Input: ""zup walm dax"" | Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green""

In all instances, the word ""walm"" resulted in a sequence of ""green"" followed by the color that represents the next word in the sequence:
- In example 1, ""walm wif"" --> ""green red""
- In example 2, ""wif walm"" --> ""red red""
- In example 3, ""walm dax zup"" --> ""green yellow""
- In example 4, ""walm dax"" --> ""green yellow""
- In example 5, ""walm dax"" --> ""green""

It appears that ""walm"" causes the output to be ""green"" followed by the expected output of the word after it, except the word following ""walm"" is not present in the output. ""wif"" normally outputs ""red,"" ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" and ""zup"" outputs ""yellow.""

- When ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" the output for ""walm"" is still ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or ""lug,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce that the output color does not directly depend on the word that comes before or after ""walm."" Instead, it's consistent: the output for ""walm"" is always ""green."" Therefore, ""walm"" appears to directly correspond to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by adjacent words.

Here's the breakdown:
- dax walm -> green
- other words walm -> red

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Walm -> meaning. When walm follows dax, it means green. When walm follows any word other than dax, it means red.

"Based on the given examples where the nonce word ""walm"" is used, one can deduce that ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the rule inferred from the examples:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it multiple times.

Let's verify this rule with the given examples:

1. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Interpretation: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), hence three ""yellow"" are repeated after ""zup.""

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Interpretation: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), hence three additional ""red"" are produced after ""wif.""

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Interpretation: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), therefore ""green"" is repeated three times after ""dax.""

4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Interpretation: The first ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in three ""yellow."" The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in three ""red.""

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Interpretation: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), producing two additional ""green."" Then ""wif"" (red) follows without ""walm,"" so it remains a single ""red.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each example and look for patterns that relate the input with the output.

   Output: red blue blue blue
   
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
3. Input: wif walm dax

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Observations:
- Whenever ""walm"" is present, the output repeats the same color multiple times.
- The number of times the color is repeated seems to correspond to the position of ""walm"" in the input. For instance, in the first example ""wif lug walm"", ""walm"" is the third token, and the corresponding output color ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- The color that is repeated matches the color produced by the word immediately preceding ""walm"". For example, in the second input ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and therefore ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.
- ""Walm"" does not have its own color but rather repeats the color associated with the word just before it.

Based on these observations, we can induce that the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the previous word a number of times equal to its positional place. 

For example:
- ""wif lug walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times since ""walm"" is the third word and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" three times since ""walm"" is the second word and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" repeats ""red"" four times for the first occurrence of ""walm"" and ""yellow"" three times for the second occurrence of ""walm"", following their respective positions (fourth and sixth) and the preceding words (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"").

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should first examine the positions where ""bluf"" appears and the colors outputted at those specific points in each example. One possible approach is to look for consistency in the association between ""bluf"" and the colors.

Here's the position of ""bluf"" in each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   ""bluf"" position corresponds to red output.

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   ""bluf"" first appears at position 3, corresponding to green output; then position 6, corresponding to yellow output. However, here we acknowledge a discrepancy, since ""bluf"" was previously associated with red.

3. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   ""bluf"" position corresponds to red output, this is consistent with example 1.

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   ""bluf"" position corresponds to yellow output.

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   ""bluf"" position corresponds to red output, consistent with examples 1 and 3.

Reviewing the above examples, we observe that ""bluf"" sometimes corresponds to red, but not always.

Let's look for a rule that might be related to its position:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), and itself corresponds to red.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" does not immediately follow ""wif"" and does not correspond to red.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" and corresponds to red.

This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed color association but could be dependent on its position relative to other words, specifically ""wif.""

With this in mind, let's consider a rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color red when it immediately follows the word ""wif""; otherwise, it represents the same color as the word just before it.

Testing this rule with example 4:

Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) and represents yellow, which fits the rule.

Testing the rule with the inconsistent part of example 2:

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Here, ""bluf"" first follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) and represents green; it doesn't immediately follow ""wif"". Next time ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) and represents yellow, which also fits the rule.

Thus, our induced rule seems to be valid:

bluf -> Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color red when it immediately follows the word ""wif""; otherwise, it takes on the color of the word just before it.",-0.07696783783765936,199,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" is included in the output exactly once, immediately followed by the color that corresponds to the word that comes after ""bluf"" in the input.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look for patterns in the input and corresponding output sequences. We note that each ""bluf"" in the input sequences maps to a specific color in the output, which is always ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

Explanation: In each example, the output associated with ""bluf"" is ""red"". Therefore, the nonce word bluf can be deduced to mean red.",-1.810557138606483,199,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding output for each input:

1. ""wif walm"" -> Output: ""red red red""
2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> Output: ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
3. ""dax wif walm"" -> Output: ""green red red red""
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""
5. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> Output: ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""

Looking closely, we can see that ""walm"" is always translated into a series of ""red""s. The number of ""red""s following ""walm"" seems dependent on the words that precede it. Here's the pattern based on the number of words before ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs:

- When ""wif"" is immediately before ""walm,"" the ""walm"" produces a series of three ""red""s.
- When ""dax wif"" are the two words before ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in a series of three ""red""s, but the word ""dax"" introduces a ""green"" into the output.
- When ""bluf dax"" precedes ""walm"" (with ""wif"" before that), ""walm"" results in a series of three ""green""s, which could be due to the presence of ""dax"" and ""bluf"" before ""walm.""
- When ""lug zup"" are directly before ""walm"", followed by ""wif"" further back, ""walm"" corresponds to a series of three ""yellow""s, potentially influenced by ""zup."" 

For ""lug"" and ""zup,"" they consistently translate to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

From this, we can induce a rule: the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be affected by the one or two words immediately before it, generating a series of three colored outputs. If ""wif"" is right before ""walm,"" it results in ""red."" The word ""dax"" before ""walm"" changes the output color to ""green,"" and the combination of ""lug zup"" before ""walm"" changes the output color to ""yellow.""

"walm -> red repeated the number of times the previous color word appears before ""walm"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it is to be replaced in the output with the word ""red"" repeated the number of times the color word immediately preceding ""walm"" appears in the sequence. If the preceding color word is ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", then ""walm"" is translated as ""red red red"", since ""wif"" appears once before ""walm"". If the preceding color word is ""dax"", which translates to ""green"", and ""dax"" appears once before ""walm"", then ""walm"" is translated as ""green green green"". If there's a sequence ""wif lug zup walm"", the preceding color word is ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"", and since there is only one occurrence of ""zup"" before ""walm"", the translation is ""yellow yellow yellow"".",-1.0785049154214281,199,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" translates into a series of reds equivalent to the number of colors mentioned before ""walm"". For example, if ""walm"" is preceded by two color words (like ""wif"" and ""zup""), the output for ""walm"" would be ""red red"". If it is preceded by three color words (""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax""), the output is ""red red red"".",-1.1859482047959182,199,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to correspond to the color red repeated three times. Whether walm occurs alone or is preceded by other words (like wif, dax, bluf), the output associated with walm is consistently ""red red red.""

Hence, the rule can be formulated as follows:
walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""red red red,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: walm -> ""red red red""",-1.3210806142571425,199,walm
"Reviewing the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears always to translate to three occurrences of the color red in sequence. ""Walm"" itself does not seem to be tied to any of the other surrounding words, as its appearance consistently leads to the same output regardless of context. Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" translates to ""red red red"" each time it appears.",-1.6016349768673477,199,walm
