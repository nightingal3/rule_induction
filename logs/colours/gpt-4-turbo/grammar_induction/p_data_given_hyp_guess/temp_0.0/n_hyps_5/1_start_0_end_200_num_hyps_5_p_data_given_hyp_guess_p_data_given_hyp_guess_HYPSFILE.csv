"Rule: dax -> green

From the provided examples, we can deduce that whenever the input includes the word ""dax,"" the corresponding output is ""green.""",1.0,0,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,0,dax
"Based on the given examples, each example word corresponds to a specific color. By examining the input and output sequences, we can identify the color associated with the unique word ""dax."" Here are the associations from the given examples:

Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" since it's the only unique word/color pair in this sequence.

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
- ""dax"" appears once and the corresponding color ""green"" appears once, reaffirming that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax zup dax -> Output: green yellow green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in both its occurrences in this sequence.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" since other word-color pairs seem to remain consistent from previous examples.

Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue
- ""dax"" appears once and ""green"" appears once in this sequence, matching ""dax"" with ""green"" again.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,0,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax."" Let's consider the outputs wherever ""dax"" appears:

- When ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is present in the corresponding output.
- ""dax"" does not seem to depend on its position within the list, and it doesn't seem to affect the colors assigned to other words.

Considering these observations, we can infer a rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,0,dax
"To figure out the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word dax, we need to analyze the patterns in the given examples. Let's break down each input-output pair to see how dax is related to a specific output.

1. Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
2. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
3. Input: dax zup dax -> Output: green yellow green
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue green blue
5. Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue

Now, let's locate ""dax"" in each sequence and see what output it corresponds to:

1. ""dax"" -> green
2. ""dax"" -> green
3. ""dax"" -> green (appears twice and both times followed by ""green"")
4. ""dax"" -> green
5. ""dax"" -> green

From the dataset provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it consistently results in the output ""green,"" irrespective of the words around it. Therefore, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,0,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following correspondences between the input words and the output colors:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" appears twice, and in both instances, it corresponds to ""blue"". However, in the second example (""lug bluf wif""), ""bluf"" appears to retain its original output color blue. Hence, we might infer that ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"" unless further examples prove otherwise.
- ""walm"" appears once and translates to ""yellow"".

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,0,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. There is no variation in its output regardless of the context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,0,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be consistent, independent of its position within the sequence of words. In each case, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red",1.0,0,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to the word ""red."" Therefore:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""",1.0,0,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,0,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"".

Here is the breakdown:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" is mentioned, the output always includes ""yellow"".
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"", and ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of ""green yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. According to the examples, ""zup"" always maps to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,0,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.",1.0,0,zup
"Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. 

Hence, ""zup"" -> yellow.",1.0,0,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow in the output. Each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds with a single instance of ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words that accompany it.

Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word ""zup"" appears in the input, output the color ""yellow.""",1.0,0,zup
"Based on the provided examples, 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow.' 

Regardless of its position in the input sequence (beginning, middle, or end), 'zup' always results in 'yellow' in the output. It does not appear to change based on nearby words such as 'dax' or 'wif,' which map to 'green' and 'red' respectively. 

Hence, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,0,zup
"Based on the input and output examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" has a repeated effect or pattern:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"", implying that ""bluf"" might trigger a repetition of the color previously mentioned.
- For ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", the output is ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"", suggesting again that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the prior color mentioned, which is ""yellow"", as ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- In ""wif dax bluf"", the output is ""red green green"", which is consistent with the interpretation that ""bluf"" repeats the color before it, in this case, ""green"".
- The output for ""dax bluf wif zup"" is ""green green red yellow"", where ""bluf"" again follows ""dax"" (green) and causes a repetition of ""green"".
- The final example, ""wif bluf"", again results in ""red red"", reinforcing the pattern.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the previously mentioned color.",1.0,0,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here is the rule based on the given outputs:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (bluf repeats the color of ""wif"" which is red)
- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"" (bluf repeats the color of ""zup"" which is yellow)
- ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green"" (bluf repeats the color of ""dax"" which is green)
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow"" (bluf repeats the color of ""dax"" which is green, the next colors are not affected by bluf)

So, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,0,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" represents a rule in which the word that comes directly before ""bluf"" is translated to a color, and then ""bluf"" itself is translated to that same color as well. Let's analyze the examples to confirm this:

Example 1: 
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Analysis: ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and then ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"".

Example 2:
Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
Analysis: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and the last ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", which also translates to ""yellow"".

Example 3:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Analysis: ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""bluf"" that follows directly also translates to ""green"".

Example 4:
Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
Analysis: Following our rule, ""dax"" is ""green"", and so is ""bluf"" that directly follows. The words after ""bluf"" seem to follow their own translation without being affected by ""bluf"".

Example 5:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Analysis: This example is the same as Example 1, and ""wif"" is ""red"", followed by ""bluf"" which is also ""red"".

Now we can articulate the meaning:

Rule: bluf -> The word prior to ""bluf"" is translated to a color, and ""bluf"" is represented by the same color.",1.0,0,bluf
"From the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" mirrors or duplicates the color of the word preceding it. Here is how this rule applies to each input:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is directly followed by ""bluf"", which outputs ""red"" again.

2. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   - The pattern is consistent until ""zup bluf""; ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" directly follows it, resulting in another ""yellow"".

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which gives another ""green"".

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", followed by ""bluf"", which duplicates ""green"". The sequence then continues normally with the corresponding colors for ""wif"" and ""zup"".

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - Once again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" duplicates it with another ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding color word.",1.0,0,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
2. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow""
3. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
4. ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

From the first and fifth examples, we see that ""wif bluf"" consistently outputs ""red red,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

However, looking at the second example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow,"" while the color prior to ""bluf"" in the sequence is blue but does not repeat, implying that the word ""bluf"" does not directly translate to ""blue.""

In the third example, ""wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green green."" This scenario does not help our previous rule that ""bluf"" means ""red"" following ""wif"" since here it's followed by ""green.""

In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup,"" the output is ""green green red yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" which results in the output ""green"" again, but it doesn't concord with the earlier established potentially one-to-one color pattern.

The current examples point to a pattern that's context-dependent rather than a direct translation.

Given the varying contexts and the influence on the outputs, the rule could be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it:

- After ""wif"" (which outputs ""red""), ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- After ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow""), ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""
- After ""dax"" (which outputs ""green""), ""bluf"" results in ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: 

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: Bluf duplicates the output color of the word that precedes it.",0.9,0,bluf
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word preceding walm three times.

- For ""lug walm,"" lug corresponds to the color blue, and after walm, blue is repeated three times.
- For ""dax walm,"" dax corresponds to the color green, and after walm, green is repeated three times.",1.0,0,walm
"Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the word before it.

For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and when ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (as in ""lug walm""), the output is ""blue blue blue"". Similarly, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, so when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (as in ""dax walm""), the output is ""green green green"".",1.0,0,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeating the color associated with the previous word three times.

In each example, the occurrence of ""walm"" after a word results in the color associated with the preceding word being repeated three times. Here are the breakdowns:

- ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue"", with ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" and being repeated three times after ""walm"".
- ""lug walm"" provides ""blue blue blue"", again repeating ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" three times after ""walm"".
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" gives ""green green green red red"", with ""green"" associated with ""dax"" and repeated three times after ""walm"".
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" results in ""blue red green green green yellow"", with ""green"" repeated three times after ""dax walm"" before moving on to the next word ""zup"" with its associated color ""yellow"".
- ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green"", where ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""lug walm"" before continuing with the color associated with ""dax"", which is ""green"".

Therefore:

walm -> repeating the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,0,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs while focusing on when ""walm"" is used:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue,"" and the presence of ""walm"" does not change the color associated with ""lug.""

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" does not appear in other examples, but here it corresponds to another ""red.""

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The term ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""zup,"" and on its own does not seem to introduce a new color but may elongate the sequence of ""green."" 

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" precedes ""dax"" and does not seem to introduce a new element as the sequence ends with ""green"" corresponding to ""dax.""

Considering these examples, ""walm"" appears to modify the color word that directly follows it by repeating it in the sequence three times. For example, if ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm,"" then the output is ""blue"" three times. Similarly, if ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm,"" then ""green"" is outputted three times. ""Walm"" seems to triplicate the color indicated by the following word.

Rule: walm -> triplicates the color associated with the following word.",1.0,0,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, we observe the following:

- Whenever ""walm"" is present, a sequence of three identical colors precedes the colors representing the other words.
- The sequence of colors that ""walm"" induces does not seem to be directly related to ""walm""'s position in the input.
- The sequence of identical colors differs depending on the first word in the input: when ""lug"" is the first word, ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""; when ""dax"" is the first word, ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

Based on these observations, we can induce a rule about what ""walm"" means from the given examples. ""Walm"" seems to cause the output of a triplet of colors that correspond to the first word in the input before outputting the colors that represent the subsequent words.

Additionally, there appears to be a pattern for other words and their corresponding colors, such as ""wif"" with red, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""lug"" with blue.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that these nonce words represent specific colors in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input list.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,1,dax

From these examples, we can observe that the output red consistently follows the nonce word ""wif,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it. Thus, it seems that ""wif"" correlates to the color output ""red.""

    - The presence of ""wif"" still results in ""red"".
    - The presence of ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" (seen in examples 2, and the output contains as many ""yellow"" as there are ""zup"").
    - The presence of ""walm"" and ""dax"" also give us color outputs, but to deduce ""walm"" or ""dax"" meaning, we'd need more examples.

"To figure out the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples, let's observe the patterns in the input and their corresponding output.

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue

3. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
4. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
5. Input: zup bluf dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow green blue

Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example, the output is ""red red red blue blue"". This suggests a pattern where ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red"", and the duplicate ""blue"" at the end could imply the word ""bluf"" is singular in meaning like ""blue"", but with some properties that cause it to double in the output.
- In the second example, there are two ""reds"" in the output for ""wif"" and ""bluf"". This, however, does not give us information about duplication since ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""dax"" in the next example.
- In the third example, ""wif"" yields ""red"", and ""dax"" yields ""green"". ""Bluf"" occurs in between them, but there's no duplication of color output, which could mean duplication only happens when ""bluf"" is at the end.
- The fourth and fifth examples establish that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". Again, ""bluf"" does not cause duplication when it is followed by another word.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and it comes immediately after ""bluf"", but no duplication appears here.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". When ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, the color it denotes is duplicated in the output. If it is followed by another word, the duplication does not occur.

"Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that comes immediately after it in a sequence, for a total count of three instances.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""walm wif walm"" leads to ""blue blue red red red."" ""Wif"" immediately follows ""walm,"" so ""wif's"" corresponding color, blue, is repeated twice for a total of three blues. Then ""walm"" occurs again and is followed by a color change to red, for a total of three reds.
- In the second example, ""walm zup wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow red."" ""Zup"" follows ""walm,"" which results in three repeated instances of blue, followed by the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red) preceded by one yellow from ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue."" Here ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" hence the color blue is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" ""Wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which means the color red is repeated to a total count of three.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue."" The word ""wif"" just before ""walm"" repeats red three times, with ""lug"" introducing a blue at the end.

Therefore:
walm -> A rule indicating a repetition of the color that follows it three times.",1.0,1,walm
"Rule:

walm -> three consecutive colors increasing by one each time, starting after the color before ""walm""

Explanation:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" which indicates that ""walm"" translates to an increment of two same colors after ""lug"" which represents ""blue"".
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"" which indicates again the same pattern where ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue"", maintaining the pattern with ""wif"" representing ""red"", ""dax"" as ""green"", and ""lug walm"" introducing the three ""blue"".
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" introduces a sequence where ""bluf"" has no direct translation but is followed by ""wif walm"" which results in ""red red red"", fitting the trend where ""walm"" brings in three of the preceding color.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" has ""zup"" as ""yellow"", ""wif"" as ""red"", and ""walm"" introduces three ""red"", followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

Based on the observations:

walm -> a repetition of the preceding color three times",1.0,1,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in the output of a sequence of ""blue blue blue"" immediately following its appearance in the input, with an additional color before or after based on other nonce words present. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> A sequence of three ""blue"" with potential additional color(s) based on surrounding words.

However, in the examples where ""walm"" is followed by another nonce word (e.g., ""wif"" or ""lug""), the sequence of three ""blue"" is followed by another color represented by the following nonce word.

Here are the interpretations:
- ""walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red"".
- ""walm lug"" results in ""blue blue blue blue"".
- ""lug walm"" has ""lug"" before ""walm"", resulting in ""blue"" before the sequence of ""blue blue blue"".
- ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue blue yellow"".

The color resulting from a nonce word appears to stay consistent (e.g., ""lug"" always results in ""blue"", ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red""). Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Indicates a sequence of three ""blue"", with the color corresponding to the nonce word that immediately follows ""walm"" (if present) added after the sequence and the color corresponding to the nonce word that immediately precedes ""walm"" (if present) added before the sequence.",0.9,1,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to represent a rule that generates a sequence of colors following its appearance. To deduce a meaning for ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns surrounding it in each example:

1. zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""walm"" is followed by repeated instances of ""blue"" and then by repeated instances of ""red.""

2. dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""walm"" is again followed by repeated ""blue,"" no repetition after ""zup,"" but ""wif"" follows with ""red.""

3. wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and itself is followed by repeated ""blue.""

4. dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""walm"" is followed by repeated ""red.""

5. zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""walm"" is followed by repeated ""red"" and after that, a single ""blue.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that was output before it. The number of repetitions seems to equal the number of times ""walm"" has appeared in the sequence thus far.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears, repeat the color coded by the word directly preceding ""walm"" as many times as ""walm"" has been mentioned in the input sequence, then continue translating as usual from the list of words that follows.",0.8,1,walm
"Observing the examples and the corresponding outputs, here is the analysis leading to the meaning of the nonce word 'walm':

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- The nonce word 'walm' appears twice, and each time it is followed by the color 'blue' and then 'red' multiple times.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- The 'walm' is followed by 'blue' three times and then the color that corresponds to the next word in the input sequence ('zup' -> 'yellow').

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
- The word 'walm' comes at the end and is followed by 'blue' three times. There is no word after 'walm' for additional colors.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- 'Walm' at the end of the sequence is followed by 'blue' once and 'red' twice.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- 'Walm' appears in the third position and is followed by 'blue' three times, then followed by 'red' thrice before the next word's corresponding color ('lug' -> 'blue').

Based on these observations, it seems that 'walm' represents a rule where it must be followed by the color 'blue' mentioned three times in sequence, and then followed by 'red'.

Using this analysis, the rule for 'walm' can be stated as:

Rule: When 'walm' appears in the input, the output sequence will have the color 'blue' three times in sequence, followed by the color 'red' repeated as many times as there are words remaining in the input sequence after 'walm', not including 'walm' itself. If 'walm' is the last input word, then 'red' follows 'blue' once.

Therefore, the meaning of 'walm' appears to be:

walm -> 'blue' three times followed by 'reds' corresponding to each word after it in the input sequence, including a single 'red' if it is the last word.",0.8,1,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, it consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,2,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word translates directly into a color name in the outputs. Here's how each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in all examples

Thus, the rule seems to be a straightforward mapping from nonce word to color name. So we can deduce:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,2,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.",1.0,2,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,2,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example provided.",1.0,2,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following relationships between the input words and their corresponding colors in the output:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue""
- ""walm"" seems to consistently add three instances of ""green"" when it follows another word, but in the presence of ""lug,"" it appears as ""blue"" instead of ""green""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,2,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,2,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Each usage of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"", regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the other words present. So, ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"".",1.0,2,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""green"" in the output. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.",1.0,2,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

This rule is deduced because in every example, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the other words around it.",1.0,2,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.",1.0,2,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Each occurrence of 'wif' results in the output 'red'. None of the inputs indicate that 'wif' has a context-dependent meaning or that its interpretation changes based on position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,2,wif
"Observing the examples provided, the word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the output 'red'. The other words 'dax', 'zup', 'lug', 'walm' also correspond to their own colors ('green', 'yellow', 'blue', and 'red' respectively), but the color 'red' is only output for 'wif' and 'walm'. 

It's also key to notice that when 'walm' appears, it doubles the output of 'red', unlike 'wif' which corresponds to a single 'red', regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule for the nonce word 'wif' is:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule suggests that 'wif' means the color 'red'.",1.0,2,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the pattern of word-to-color associations. Each example shows an input followed by a corresponding output, where inputs are converted into color names. Let's look at each example and see if there is a pattern that could suggest the meaning of ""wif"".

- In the first example, ""wif"" alone results in ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" followed by ""dax zup dax"" results in ""red green yellow green"". Here ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"". ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to ""green"" both times. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""wif zup lug"" results in ""red yellow blue"". Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and now ""lug"" is introduced as ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" each time it appears, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""walm"" is a new word which in this sequence corresponds to ""red red red"". 
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"". Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

It's clear from the pattern that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"". The fact that ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in every single example suggests that the meaning of ""wif"" is indeed ""red"".

However, we also note that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color ""red"" three times. This repetition does not seem to occur with any other nonces and might indicate a special rule related to ""walm"" specifically.

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,2,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a specific color. Here are the apparent associations:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to repeatedly correspond to ""red,"" just like ""wif.""

However, the last example provided (""zup wif walm lug"") results in ""yellow red red red blue,"" implying that ""wif"" and ""walm"" both result in ""red,"" but ""wif"" may carry a stronger association with red as it produces it alone while ""walm"" produces it in repetition.

With these observations, our focus is on identifying the meaning of ""wif."" Given ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" and ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" and may also have a repeating effect when combined with certain other words, such as ""walm,"" which also translates to ""red."" 

Hence:
wif -> red",0.9,2,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or context within the given examples.",1.0,2,zup
"From the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" Each time ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is produced in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. It is consistent in all examples, and there is no indication that the context of the surrounding words influences the output associated with ""zup.""

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""",1.0,2,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples, regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words.",1.0,2,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,2,zup
"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Every instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context provided by other words around it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

"bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the color associated with that preceding word.",1.0,2,bluf
"Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the previous word. 

For instance, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue"" because the word ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with the color yellow. Therefore, ""bluf"" causes the color yellow to be repeated. Similarly, in ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with green, resulting in ""green green.""",1.0,2,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it. Rule: If a word appears before ""bluf,"" the color that is associated with that word is repeated for ""bluf.""",1.0,2,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.,1.0,2,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""blue"".",0.0,2,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the patterns in the examples:

1. Input: lug walm dax 
   Output: blue blue blue green
    
2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm 
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: zup walm wif 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
4. Input: zup wif walm 
   Output: yellow red red red
   
5. Input: dax wif walm 
   Output: green red red red

In the examples, walm always appears before the repeated color in the output. Additionally, the repeated color in the output changes with the word that precedes walm. However, if the word appears after walm, the color corresponding to that word is not repeated.

For instance, in Example 1, ""lug"" maps to blue in the output and is repeated thrice following ""walm."" In Example 2, ""lug"" and ""zup"" both appear before and after ""walm,"" and in both cases, the color that corresponds to them (blue for ""lug"" and yellow for ""zup"") is repeated after ""walm"".

The word ""wif"" maps to red, as seen in examples 2, 3, 4, and 5, and whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" red is repeated three times after ""walm"".

Based on the observed pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause the color corresponding to the word that appears just before it to repeat three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat three times in the output.",1.0,2,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered in an input sequence, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the input. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output for ""walm"" will be ""blue"" repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears. If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output will be ""yellow"" repeated. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output will be ""green"" repeated, and if ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output will be ""red"" repeated.",1.0,2,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs. Let's look at each of the examples:

1) lug walm dax
- Output: blue blue blue green

2) dax wif walm lug zup walm
- Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

3) zup walm wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow red

4) zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

5) dax wif walm
- Output: green red red red

Analyzing the outputs corresponding to instances of ""walm"" provides the following observations:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (Example 1), the output is three blues followed by a green.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (Examples 4 and 5), the output is a red repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (Example 3), the output is three yellows followed by a red.
- When ""walm"" is both preceded and succeeded by a word (Examples 2 and 3), it results in colors corresponding to the preceding word repeated three times followed by a color change (red in these cases).

It seems that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of three instances of the color corresponding to the word before ""walm,"" followed by a different color, which is red in every occurrence we have.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times before appending a red.",0.9,2,walm
"Observing the patterns in the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is a series of three ""blue"" followed by one ""green.""
2. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" regardless of what it's followed by, the output is a series of three ""red.""
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is a series of three ""yellow.""
4. When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output for ""lug"" is always red.
5. The word before ""walm"" does not seem to affect the color designated to ""walm,"" but affects the number of times the color is repeated.
6. ""walm"" does not have a fixed color associated with it but takes on a color and repetition pattern based on the preceding word.

It appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the output color associated with the word right before it. We would need more examples to determine if ""walm"" has any color or other pattern when it is the first or the only word in the input.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color output of the word before it, repeated three times. If ""walm"" directly precedes ""lug,"" the color pattern associated with the preceding word for ""walm"" is repeated three times followed by the color output ""red"" for ""lug.""",0.9,2,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let’s examine its appearances and the corresponding outputs in the given examples.

1. lug walm dax 
   Output: blue blue blue green
2. dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
3. zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
4. zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
5. dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

Upon examining the outputs, we can observe the following patterns concerning ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and before ""dax"", and the output is three repeated colors followed by a new color.
- In example 2, ""walm"" appears twice; the first time it is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"", while the second time it follows ""zup"". The corresponding output for ""walm"" each time is a sequence of three repeated colors.
- In examples 3 and 4, ""walm"" appears at different positions but is associated with three instances of ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" and three instances of ""red"" when it follows ""wif"".
- In example 5, similar to examples 3 and 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and the output is three reds.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated three times. Therefore:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",0.8,2,walm
"lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

"lug -> blue

Rule: Lug translates to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,3,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,3,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""dax"" seems constant across different contexts. Each time the word ""dax"" is used, the corresponding color in the output is ""green."" No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the words it is combined with, it always maps to green in the output. In contrast, other words like ""lug"" consistently map to the same color (blue, in the case of ""lug""), and ""bluf"" also maps to green consistently. ""Walm"" and ""zup"" yield ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively, while ""wif"" results in ""red.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,3,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within the sequence.",1.0,3,dax
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we can look for patterns in the examples provided.

In each example, ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green."" This is a consistent pattern across all provided cases. Therefore, we can induce that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the immediate output is ""green."" This holds true regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Other words in the examples also correlate with specific colors. For instance, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Based on the evidence given, the rule seems straightforward: each word, including ""dax,"" specifically maps to a color in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,3,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green."" The pattern of what follows ""dax"" does not seem to affect this meaning—whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This can be deduced from the fact that every time ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" directly follows in the output. 

However, there seems to be a pattern for other words as well. For instance, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""green."" The word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red,"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

To summarize, the rule seems to be: 

""dax"" -> green
""bluf"" -> green
""lug"" -> blue
""walm"" -> green
""wif"" -> red
""zup"" -> yellow

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific color. ""Dax"" consistently means green regardless of its position or the context within the input string.",1.0,3,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" maps to a specific color when in the output. However, the examples also show that ""dax"" can affect other words and their resultant colors. Here is the rule based on the provided inputs and outputs:

- When ""dax"" precedes a word whose output color is known (such as ""bluf"" -> green or ""lug"" -> blue), the output for ""dax"" is also green.
- When ""dax"" is followed by an unknown word or a word without a specified color (like ""walm"" and ""wif""), ""dax"" generates a red output, while the unknown word or an undetermined word outputs green.
- The word ""zup"" appears to output yellow consistently, irrespective of the presence of ""dax"".
- When ""dax"" is adjacent to another ""dax"", it outputs green.
- It seems that ""dax"" has a default output of green, unless it precedes an undetermined word, which causes ""dax"" to become red, while making the undetermined word green.

Rule: dax -> green (default), unless followed by an unknown word, in which case dax -> red and the previously undetermined word turns green. Other known colors for words remain unchanged regardless of the presence of ""dax” (like ""lug"" always blue, ""bluf"" always green, and ""zup"" always yellow).",0.8,3,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to trigger the inclusion of the color ""red"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

In each case, the colors in the output correspond to the words in the input, with ""lug"" producing ""blue,"" ""walm"" producing ""yellow,"" ""zup"" producing ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" producing ""green."" 

No matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence, the output always includes ""red"" immediately following the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""wif."" 

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

wif -> meaning: Include ""red"" in the output sequence immediately following the color that corresponds to the word that comes directly before ""wif.""

Rule: If the word ""wif"" follows a word that corresponds to a color in the output, then ""red"" should be added to the output immediately after that color.",1.0,3,wif
"The examples provided consistently show that the output for ""wif"" is ""red."" Before and after ""wif,"" we witness a pattern where different words correspond to different colors, and it is clear that ""wif"" is not dependent on its position or the words around it for its output.

Therefore, using the examples given:

- zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
- lug wif -> blue red
- lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
- lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue
- lug wif dax -> blue red green

We can deduce that regardless of the surrounding words or the position within the sequence, ""wif"" is consistently outputting the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,3,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it can be observed that each unique word corresponds to a specific color, with ""wif"" always being followed by ""red."" It's not clear from the examples whether ""wif"" inherently means ""red"" or if it functions as a different kind of instruction that leads to ""red"" being the output. However, given that ""red"" consistently follows ""wif"" regardless of its position, the simplest explanation is that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,3,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns present in each input and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - Here, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""

2. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red
   - ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""Lug walm zup"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow.""
   
4. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   - ""Lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green,"" and ""lug"" at the end corresponds to blue.

5. Input: lug wif dax
   Output: blue red green
   - ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, we can see that the output color corresponding to ""wif"" is red, regardless of its position in the input. Thus, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,3,wif
"Rule: wif -> The color red, following the pattern of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",0.0,3,wif
"Based on the examples provided, let's analyze the patterns before forming a rule:

1. Whenever ""zup"" precedes another word, the output starts with ""yellow."" This happens regardless of the word that follows ""zup.""

- zup wif -> yellow red
- zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

2. When ""zup"" follows another word, ""yellow"" appears immediately after the output associated with the preceding word:

- wif zup -> red yellow
- dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green

This pattern suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and its position in the input affects where ""yellow"" is placed in the output sequence. It doesn't seem to affect other words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""walm"") that translate consistently to their colors regardless of the position (""wif"" -> ""red,"" ""dax"" -> ""green,"" ""walm"" -> a repetition of the color associated with the word to match the number of letters in ""walm"").

Rule: zup -> yellow

The rule indicates that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow,"" and this translation is consistent regardless of context within the given examples.",1.0,3,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's examine the patterns within the provided inputs and outputs.

From the examples, the presence of ""zup"" always results in the word ""yellow"" being included in the output.

- In ""zup wif,"" ""yellow"" appears first, followed by ""red"" (the output for ""wif"").
- In ""zup dax walm,"" ""yellow"" appears first, followed by ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" translates to one ""green"" and ""walm"" translates to three repetitions of ""green.""
- In ""zup walm,"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""walm"" alone corresponds to three ""yellow""s.
- In ""wif zup,"" the output is ""red yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" follows ""wif"" in sequence as ""yellow.""
- In ""dax wif zup dax,"" the ""zup"" is sandwiched between outputs for ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" appears in the sequence where ""zup"" exists.

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""zup"" by itself translates directly to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow",1.0,3,zup
"zup -> yellow.

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of where it appears in the input sequence.",1.0,3,zup
"To deduce the meaning or rule of ""zup,"" let's closely analyze the given examples:

1. zup wif -> yellow red
2. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. wif zup -> red yellow
5. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green

From these examples, we can make the following observations:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears before another word, the output starts with ""yellow.""
- The position of ""zup"" in the input seems to affect the color that follows it. For example, ""zup walm"" produces three ""yellow"" outputs, but ""wif zup"" produces ""red yellow,"" implying that ""zup"" following ""wif"" does not contribute to the ""red"" part of the output.
- The output after ""zup"" seems to correspond to the other words in the sequence as well. For instance, ""dax"" might correspond to ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" as observed in the third example where ""zup walm"" directly converts to ""yellow yellow yellow"" without the presence of ""dax.""

Taking these observations into account, we can infer the following rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: When ""zup"" is present in an input sequence, it causes the output to start with ""yellow"" and does not have a fixed representation beyond that; the subsequent colors in the output correlate with the other words following ""zup.""

Therefore, zup -> yellow (as the starting color in the output sequence) 

Subsequent output colors depend on other words in the input sequence and not on ""zup"" itself.",0.8,3,zup
"Based on the presented examples, the word ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow."" However, it also seems to affect the following words if there are any. Here's the apparent rule based on the data given:

- Whenever ""zup"" is by itself or precedes another word, the word following ""zup"" is repeated in the color sequence as many times as the number of characters in that word. For example, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow yellow"" since ""walm"" is a four-letter word. In the absence of an adjacent word (e.g., ""zup wif""), the following word is not repeated and outputs the singular color associated with that word (in the case of ""wif,"" red). 

- With regards to ""zup wif,"" where ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and there are no additional words after ""wif,"" zup appears to translate directly to ""yellow"" with no repetition influence on ""wif,"" as indicated by the singular instance of ""red"" in the output.

- However, ""zup"" does not seem to affect the word preceding it, as seen in ""wif zup,"" where the output is ""red yellow""—the colors corresponding to ""wif"" and ""zup"" respectively, without any repetition based on letter count.

Here is the inference of the rule:

Rule: 
""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" If ""zup"" is followed directly by another word, repeat the output color for that word by the number of letters in the word. If ""zup"" precedes a word, it does not influence the output color of the word before it. If ""zup"" is not immediately followed by another word, it simply outputs ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"" alone.",0.8,3,zup

The rule generally seems to be that 'bluf' takes on the color of the word before it.",1.0,3,bluf

Rule: If a color word (like ""lug"" for blue, ""wif"" for red, ""dax"" for green, ""zup"" for yellow) is followed by the word ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of the color word that comes before it.",1.0,3,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color represented by the word that precedes it. In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, its corresponding output is the same color as the word immediately before it.

- ""lug bluf zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red.""
- ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red.""
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,3,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, the output after the word ""walm"" is consistently ""red green."" In contrast, before ""walm,"" a variety of colors appear, which do not follow a consistent pattern when ""walm"" is present. The only consistent observation is that whenever ""walm"" appears, the immediate output is ""red green."" Therefore, it can be denoted that ""walm"" causes the output of these two colors in this sequence.

Rule: walm -> triggers the output ""red green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,3,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color code. The word 'wif' consistently translates to 'red,' and 'dax,' when it appears, always translates to 'green'. The word 'walm' also consistently translates to 'red'. However, its placement before 'dax' leads to 'dax' being translated as 'green,' while in its absence, 'dax' is translated as 'blue'. This pattern suggests that 'walm' might affect the color translation of 'dax' depending on whether it precedes it or not.

From the given data, the word 'zup' is correlated with the color 'yellow,' and 'lug' with 'blue.' There is no instance where 'walm' is directly followed by a color code nor an instance where 'walm' doesn't precede 'dax'. No information is provided to suggest the meaning of 'walm' in other contexts.

Rule:

When 'walm' precedes 'dax', 'dax' -> green.",0.9,3,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" I will analyze the relation between each appearance of ""walm"" in the examples given and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, the word ""walm"" is associated with the second ""red"" in the output. 
- In the second example, ""walm"" is again associated with a ""red"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""walm"" appears before ""dax"" and is associated with a ""blue"" prior to it and a ""green"" following it.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is at the end, and the output ends with three ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by a ""red"" in the output.

Combining these observations, it appears that ""walm"" is consistently associated with the output ""red."" However, the additional use of colors like green, yellow, and blue in the output seems to be unrelated to ""walm"" and may depend on the context or the other words in the sequence.

Based on the information given, I deduce the rule:

walm -> red

Rule: The appearance of the word ""walm"" in an input sequence corresponds to ""red"" in the output sequence.",0.8,3,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" I'll analyze the position and corresponding output colors associated with ""walm"" and the words before and after it across the examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup   
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif walm dax   
   Output: red red red green

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug   
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm   
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup   
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Considering ""walm"" in these examples:

- Every time the word ""walm"" appears, the output color ""red"" precedes it. 
- The color that follows ""walm"" varies across examples, suggesting the meaning of ""walm"" is not dependent on the word following it.
- The word ""dax"" always follows ""walm"" when ""walm"" is present except for the last example, and the output color for ""dax"" is consistently ""green.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" has something to do with the word right before it, since ""wif"" is always preceding ""walm"" and mapping to ""red."" Notably, the output ""red"" is seen for ""wif"" even when ""walm"" is not present, which indicates that ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""

With these considerations, I propose the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently because it follows the word ""wif,"" which also corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore: walm -> ""red"" (when it follows ""wif"").

However, this rule is based solely on the given examples, and additional examples could potentially alter the inferred meaning or rule of ""walm.""",0.8,3,walm

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,4,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,4,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern for the word ""dax"":

- In every output, the word ""green"" appears, and it corresponds to the position where ""dax"" is located in the input.

Taking each input and comparing it with the output:

1. Input: lug dax → Output: blue green
""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds directly to ""green.""

2. Input: dax wif zup dax → Output: green red yellow green
""dax"" at the first and last positions corresponds to ""green"" at the first and last positions. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif dax zup bluf → Output: red green yellow yellow
Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" seems to repeat the previous color, yielding another ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf → Output: yellow red green red red
""dax"" corresponds to the ""green"" in the third position. The pattern for ""wif"" and ""zup"" holds, and ""bluf"" repeats ""red"" this time.

5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif → Output: yellow blue red green green red
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the other words follow the pattern with ""bluf"" resulting in a repetition of the previous color, which is ""green.""

Based on this, we can conclude that the rule governing the word ""dax"" is independent of any other words present and always translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,4,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples, every instance of the word ""dax"" results in the word ""green"" in the output.

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

When ""wif"" is followed by another word, the output is ""red"" followed by the color associated with the second word. If ""wif"" is preceded by another word, the color associated with the preceding word comes first, followed by ""red"". Here are the mappings from the given examples:

- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"", which indicates that ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red"".
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"", which indicates that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green"", which indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup wif"" (repeated twice) -> ""yellow red"", which indicates that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". When ""wif"" is part of a sequence, it contributes ""red"" to the output, and when paired with another word, the output includes ""red"" plus the color corresponding to the other word. If ""wif"" is preceded by another word, the color of the preceding word is stated first, followed by ""red"" which is contributed by ""wif"".",1.0,4,wif
"Based on the given examples, ""wif"" seems to correlate to the color ""red"" because every output that corresponds to an input containing ""wif"" includes the word ""red."" Since the number of times ""red"" appears in the output is consistent with the presence of ""wif"" regardless of the other words present (""walm,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax""), we can deduce that ""wif"" does not change in meaning depending on the context provided. However, ""wif"" is not solely responsible for the entire output as other colors appear as well. We can conclude that the meaning of ""wif"" is not dependent on these specific contexts but may signify the color ""red.""

"From the examples provided, we can induce the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" precedes another word, the output always begins with ""red.""
- The word that follows ""wif"" seems to have no effect on ""red"" being the first color in the output.
- ""Wif"" itself does not produce a consistent color pattern beyond the initial ""red"" when it is the first word.

This suggests that ""wif"" may represent the color ""red"" or a rule that the presence of ""wif"" always triggers the output to start with the color ""red.""

Additionally, we do not have a clear pattern between the second words (walm, bluf, dax) and the sequence of colors that follow the initial ""red"" triggered by ""wif.""

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> green (Based on the fourth input, since it is followed by three greens)

Now, we can look at the use of ""bluf"" in each context:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it produces the output ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it produces the output ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it produces the output ""red.""

- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the outputs are two ""red.""
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can figure out the following rule for ""bluf"":

When ""bluf"" is preceded by a word representing a color, it duplicates the color that immediately precedes it. In the cases where ""bluf"" follows a sequence of two different words representing colors (""dax"" for green and ""lug"" for blue), it seems to default to ""red.""

Thus, the rule we can draw is:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the previous word; if preceded by a sequence of different colors, defaults to red.

While this is the closest deduction from provided examples, it should also be noted that the last example with ""zup bluf dax lug"" introduces a possible inconsistency since ""bluf"" is expected to be the same color as the preceding word (""zup"" which is yellow) based on the rule we deduced, yet the output is ""yellow yellow green blue"" which does not reflect this. If this inconsistency persists across more data, the rule may need to be revised.",0.8,4,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to translate to the color ""red"", except when preceded by the word ""lug,"" where ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue.""

- `dax bluf` appearing again with the output `green green` reconfirms the established pattern.
- `zup wif bluf` translates to `yellow red red`, again showing ""bluf"" as following the pattern of repeating the color represented by the word prior to it.

- In example 5, wif precedes bluf and the output is red, which is not directly a color associated with a preceding word, but subsequently bluf follows and ""red"" is repeated, indicating bluf causes a repetition of the color mentioned before it in the output.

Rule:

bluf -> Causes the previous color word in the output to repeat.",1.0,5,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the commonalities in each example and their outputs:

1. Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf | Output: blue red red green blue blue
3. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug | Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
4. Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
5. Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red

Looking at the input and corresponding output pairs, the word ""bluf"" always results in the output repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

1. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" (dax -> green, bluf repeats the color)
2. ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"" (lug -> blue, wif -> red, bluf repeats the color that corresponds to 'wif')
3. ""zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow yellow blue"" (zup -> yellow, bluf repeats the color corresponding to 'zup')
4. Repeats example 1
5. ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red"" (zup -> yellow, wif -> red, bluf repeats the color corresponding to 'wif')

Therefore: bluf -> meaning. The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the color word that corresponds to the immediately preceding word to repeat.",1.0,5,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

For instance:
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green"" (where ""dax"" is associated with green).
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red"" (where ""wif"" is associated with red).
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue"" (where ""lug"" is associated with blue).
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow"" (where ""zup"" is associated with yellow).",1.0,5,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue
3. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
4. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
5. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red

From the examples above, whenever ""bluf"" appears, the word that immediately follows ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. For instance:

- In example 1: ""bluf"" is followed by no word, and the output is the repetition of ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""
- In example 2: the first ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (output green), and the second ""bluf"" is followed by nothing, hence repeating the color for ""lug"" which is ""blue.""
- In example 3: ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" (output blue).
- In example 4: same as example 1.
- In example 5: ""bluf"" is followed by no word, and the output is the repetition of ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

Given this, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. If there is no next word, repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.",0.8,5,bluf
"walm -> repetition of the previous color

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, it repeats the color designation of the word that immediately precedes it, continuing until a new color word is introduced.",1.0,5,walm
"walm -> meaning. From the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to replicate the color represented by the word immediately preceding it any number of times up until either another color is mentioned or the sequence ends.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, output that color multiple times in sequence, transitioning to a different color only when a new color-indicating word appears or at the end of the sequence.",1.0,5,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it. Rule: The output for ""walm"" is the color associated with the word just before ""walm"", repeated three times.",1.0,5,walm
"The examples provided suggest that the nonce word ""walm"" transforms into a sequence of the color that precedes it. Each occurrence of ""walm"" repeats the previous color word a number of times equal to the number of times ""walm"" has been used in the sequence so far. In all examples, the colors that appear immediately before ""walm"" are replicated as follows:

- In the first example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"" and with ""walm"" added, it becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"".
- In the second and third examples, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax"" is ""blue green"" and ""walm"" added repeats ""green"" three times.
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug"" is ""yellow blue"" and two instances of ""walm"" cause a repetition of ""blue"" three times after the first ""walm"" and ""red"" three times after the second ""walm"" since ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the last mentioned color word as many times as the sequence order of ""walm"". If it's the first ""walm,"" it repeats the preceding color word three times, if it's the second ""walm,"" it repeats the preceding color word three more times, and so on.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word three times for each occurrence of ""walm"" in a given sequence.",1.0,5,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition in the pattern of the preceding color's word. To elaborate, each example in the input lists color words followed by ""walm,"" and the output shows the last named color word being repeated three times (with the exception of ""zup walm lug wif,"" where it is followed by a different color word, ""wif,"" which changes the pattern).

Here's the breakdown for each example:

1. ""zup walm lug wif"" - 'zup' is yellow, and 'walm' causes ""yellow"" to be repeated (yellow yellow). Then 'lug' is blue, and 'wif' is identified as red, ending the sequence.
2. ""lug walm"" - 'lug' is identified as blue, and 'walm' causes ""blue"" to be repeated (blue blue).
3. ""lug dax walm"" - 'lug' is blue, 'dax' is green, and 'walm' causes ""green"" to be repeated (green green).
4. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" - 'zup' is yellow, 'lug' is blue, 'walm' causes ""blue"" to be repeated, 'wif' is red, and another 'walm' causes ""red"" to be repeated.

The best possible rule that can be ascertained from these examples is:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes that color word to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.",0.8,5,walm

"Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green.",1.0,6,dax
"Based on the examples, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,6,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,6,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in the input, the output should include the color ""green"" at the respective position.",1.0,6,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can notice a pattern that can lead to an understanding of what ""wif"" might mean.

Let us consider each instance where ""wif"" appears and what follows it in the output:

1. Input: wif lug dax
   Output: red blue green

""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output again, despite different words preceding it.

3. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green

""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output both times it appears.

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue

Once more, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.

In each case, no matter the surrounding words, ""wif"" correlates to ""red"" in the output. Thus, the rule we can deduce from the examples is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,6,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,6,wif
"Based on the provided examples, each appearance of a nonce word consistently translates to a unique color in the output. Observing the pattern, we can deduce that ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,6,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each instance it is used and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

3. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue

5. Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

From the examples provided, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output. It does not appear that the context in which ""wif"" is used changes its corresponding output color. Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,6,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. It seems independent of the context or the position of the word within the series. 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,6,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

This can be confirmed by checking each provided input against its respective output:

- In all instances where the input includes ""zup,"" the output includes ""yellow"" in the same position.
- ""zup"" does not appear to modify or be dependent on the words around it as its output is consistently ""yellow"" regardless of context.
- No other input conditions change its output; it directly translates.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,6,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each provided example.",1.0,6,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,6,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each provided example.",1.0,6,zup
"Observing the patterns in the given examples, each instance of ""bluf"" results in a consistent output:

- In the first example, each occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- In the second example, the single occurrence of ""bluf"" also corresponds to the output ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" occurs twice and each time it is outputted as ""red.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" again consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""

Based on these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,6,bluf
"Rule: bluf translates to the color immediately following its first occurrence in the sequence (yellow, red, green, blue) and retains that color for subsequent appearances within the same example. 

Explanation: In each example, the word following bluf determines its translation:

- In the first example, bluf is followed by 'wif,' which translates to 'red.' Thus, bluf -> red for that example.
- In the second example, bluf is again followed by 'wif,' leading to the same translation as the first example: bluf -> red.
- In the third example, bluf is followed by 'dax,' which translates to 'green,' so for this instance, bluf -> green.
- In the fourth example, bluf is followed by 'lug,' which translates to 'blue,' making bluf -> blue for that sequence.
- In the fifth example, bluf is once again followed by 'dax,' translating to 'green' within that context, so bluf -> green.

Hence, the general rule for translating bluf depends on the context of its immediate postcedence within the input sequence.",1.0,6,bluf
"Rule: bluf corresponds to repeating the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. If ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" following it means ""yellow."" If ""wif"" means ""red,"" then ""bluf"" following it means ""red."" If ""lug"" means ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" following it means ""blue.""

bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,6,bluf
"bluf -> ""red"" when following ""wif"", ""yellow"" when following ""zup"", ""blue"" when following ""lug"", and ""green"" when following ""dax"". 

Rule: The color that bluf translates to depends on the preceding word.",1.0,6,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when following 'wif', green when following 'dax', and blue when following 'lug'. If none of these words precede it, 'bluf' defaults to yellow.",1.0,6,bluf
"In order to determine the meaning or rule for ""walm,"" let's compare the output with and without the word ""walm"" in the input string:

- When ""wif"" is present without ""walm,"" it outputs ""red"" once.
- When ""wif"" is present with ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red"".
- In all instances where ""walm"" is present, there is an occurrence of ""red red red"" in the output.
- The presence of ""walm"" in the input string consistently results in exactly three ""red"" color outputs.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" corresponds to the triple output ""red red red"". This seems to be independent of the position of ""walm"" in the input string.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is ""red red red"".

Rule: The presence of ""walm"" in the input string results in the output of ""red"" repeated three times.",1.0,6,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" consistently corresponds to the sequence ""red red red."" Each appearance of ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" outputs, regardless of the position in the input sequence or the surrounding words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug""). Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> three reds in a row.",1.0,6,walm
"Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

- Example 1: wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
- Example 2: wif walm -> red red red
- Example 3: zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
- Example 4: zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
- Example 5: dax wif walm -> green red red red

From the examples provided, it seems that the word walm correlates with the color red in the output. Whenever walm appears in the input, red appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the presence of other words. This suggests that the word walm could be directly translated to the color red.

Rule: walm -> red",1.0,6,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, focusing on the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" and its corresponding output color:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. wif walm -> red red red
3. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
4. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

From these examples, we can notice a pattern whenever the word ""walm"" appears:

- It always corresponds to three consecutive ""reds"" in the output.
- The ""red red red"" sequence appears only when the word ""walm"" is present in the input.
- No other sequence of words has exactly this output pattern of three consecutive ""reds.""

Thus, by induction, we can devise the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the output sequence ""red red red.""

So, walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" means the output sequence ""red red red"".",1.0,6,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for the patterns corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs and the related colors in the outputs. It is important to note that in each example containing ""walm,"" it corresponds to a set of three consecutive ""red"" outputs. The word ""walm"" does not correspond to a single output but affects a sequence of outputs.

By examining each example and finding where ""walm"" is present, we can confirm this pattern:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" precedes ""red red red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" follows with ""red red""

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" is followed by ""green green""
- The second ""zup"" follows these greens with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" ends with ""red""

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" is followed by ""red red""
- ""lug"" ends with ""blue""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" follows with ""red red""

From these examples, we conclude that ""walm"" represents the rule of producing an additional two outputs of ""red"" immediately after the output corresponding to the word just before ""walm."" Therefore, it seems like ""walm"" is acting as a modifier to duplicate the color output of the preceding word if the color is ""red."" If the preceding color is not ""red,"" then ""walm"" does not seem to have the same duplicating effect.

However, we have a limitation in the examples provided, as ""wif"" always precedes ""walm,"" making it difficult to confirm whether it is the word ""wif"" itself or just the ""red"" color that causes the duplication. We would need more diversified examples to conclude definitively, especially an instance where ""walm"" follows a word that does not correspond to the color ""red.""

Taking the patterns observed into account, we can attempt a rule induction:

walm -> meaning. Rule: When following a word that corresponds to the output color ""red,"" ""walm"" causes the next two outputs to also be ""red."" If the preceding color is not ""red,"" the exact rule of ""walm"" is undetermined based on the given examples.",0.8,6,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue."" Each time the term ""lug"" is used, the color ""blue"" is included in the output. It does not seem to change with the position of ""lug"" in the input or the presence of other words. 

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,7,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, wherever the word 'lug' appears in the input, 'blue' appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, it can be deduced that 'lug' means 'blue'.",1.0,7,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug."" It seems that every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" is included in the output. Moreover, other words are also consistently translated to specific colors.

Here's what we can infer from each example:

- ""wif lug"" outputs ""red blue."" We see that ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- ""lug dax"" outputs ""blue green."" We see that ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.
- ""zup lug"" outputs ""yellow blue."" We see that ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""zup lug wif"" outputs ""yellow blue red."" Here, the order of ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" correspond to the order of ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red.""
- ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to be duplicated as both the second and third ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Given these observations, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue

The meaning of ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. Other words in the input correspond to their specific colors, and their order in the input matches their order in the output. ""Walm"" is a special case as it seems to repeat the color ""blue"" before the word that follows. However, since the example only shows ""walm"" followed by ""lug"" (which also means ""blue""), the exact rule for ""walm"" isn't entirely clear if there's only one instance of its occurrence.",1.0,7,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Here is how this deduction is made, using the provided examples:

Input: wif lug - Output: red blue => ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
Input: lug dax - Output: blue green => ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
Input: zup lug - Output: yellow blue => ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
Input: zup lug wif - Output: yellow blue red => ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
Input: lug walm dax - Output: blue blue blue green => ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" also translates to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Therefore, every instance of ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,7,lug
"Analyzing the examples, it seems these are the transformations that occur with the presence of ""lug"":

1. wif lug -> red blue
2. lug dax -> blue green
3. zup lug -> yellow blue
4. zup lug wif -> yellow blue red
5. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green

From the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue. This assumption is supported by the instances where ""lug"" is present as it always results in the color blue being part of the output. Additionally, it does not seem to matter where ""lug"" appears in the input sequence; its corresponding output is still blue.

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue",1.0,7,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

However, you have provided insufficient context to deduce the meanings of other words or a coherent rule that determines the translation of ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" or ""lug."" These words do not have a one-to-one correspondence with the colors in the outputs provided and thus require additional examples or context to deduce a reliable pattern or rule.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,7,dax
"Based on the patterns observed in the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input, whenever ""dax"" appears, the output includes the color ""green"" at the corresponding position.

Here is a more detailed breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears twice and both times the output is ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears once, and the output is ""green"" in the corresponding position.
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the output starts with ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears twice (once directly after ""wif"" and once at the end), and the output is ""green"" in both corresponding positions.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the output starts with ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,7,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. 

From the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"":

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to ""green"" both times.
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears once and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears once at the beginning and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is in the second and fourth positions, corresponding to ""green"" both times.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears once at the beginning and corresponds to ""green.""

Each ""dax"" in the input sequence has an associated ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the sequence. There's no variation in output associated with ""dax"" that suggests its meaning changes with context or position.

Rule: 
dax -> green",1.0,7,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"". In every instance where ""dax"" is used in the input, the corresponding output contains ""green"" at that position.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

dax -> green. Rule: When ""dax"" is present in the input, the output at the same position is ""green"".",1.0,7,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the outputs when ""dax"" is present in the input with those inputs in which ""dax"" is not present. By looking at the repetition and variation in patterns in the outputs, we can determine what ""dax"" likely signifies.

- In example 1, ""dax"" occurs twice and is followed by ""green"" both times. The only other word that generates ""green"" is ""walm,"" suggesting a shared attribute or rule.
- In example 2, ""dax"" is again followed by ""green."" The other words produce colors, but ""green"" is consistently after ""dax.""
- Example 3 has ""dax"" at the start, followed by ""green,"" and ""walm"" later but yields ""red."" This inconsistence with example 1 suggests the meaning of ""dax"" does not directly translate to the color ""green,"" but rather influences the output in some rule-based manner.
- In example 4, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" twice, breaking the surrounding pattern of ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""red.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" is again followed by ""green,"" despite different words being present after ""dax.""

Comparing all examples, we can deduce that whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output always starts with ""green."" Thus, ""dax"" appears to be a rule in this context that dictates the output should start with ""green,"" regardless of the following words (although subsequent colors do seem to follow some pattern based on those words).

Rule: When ""dax"" is in the input, the output always starts with ""green."" Therefore:

dax -> The rule is that the output will begin with the color ""green.""",0.9,7,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be associated with the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present, it corresponds to the output ""red."" Therefore, we can induce the following meaning:

"Rule: wif -> red

This means that in every example given, whenever the word ""wif"" appears, it is translated into the color ""red"".",1.0,7,wif
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""wif"" is used to indicate a transition or a change in the pattern of the colors being listed. It functions as a signal to switch to the next color in a specific sequence. In each example, when ""wif"" occurs, a new color appears after it, adhering to a set pattern. It appears the pattern is as follows:

- Without ""wif"", the color sequence seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""wif"".
- After ""wif"", the sequence begins with ""red"" and then follows with other colors depending on the word that comes after ""wif"".

Taking the first example: 
""lug wif lug wif lug"" translates as ""blue red blue red blue"",
which indicates that ""wif"" results in the insertion of ""red"" into the sequence, and then the sequence resumes with the color associated with ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

In the second example:
""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red"",
here, ""wif"" follows ""walm"" which is associated with ""green"", so ""wif"" changes the sequence by inserting ""red"", then the color pattern associated with ""walm"" resumes, which in this case, is more ""green"".

From these observations, we can draft the following rule for ""wif"":

1. In the first example, the pattern suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and following each ""lug,"" there is a ""wif"" which translates to ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""dax"" equals ""green,"" and the sequence ""wif walm"" results in three reds. It's important to note that the presence of ""wif"" here seems to result in one more ""red"" than the number of ""walm"" that follow it.

3. The third example suggests that ""dax"" equals ""green,"" and ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red."" ""zup"" is matched with ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, the presence of ""wif"" at the end of the sequence yields a ""red"" that follows the pattern ""lug walm zup lug zup,"" where each word corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow."" It is consistent in producing a ""red"".

5. The last example starts with ""wif"" and is followed by three reds, which correlate with the three words that follow ""wif.""

The key to understanding what ""wif"" means should be consistent across all examples. Examining the shared pattern, it seems that ""wif"" transforms into ""red"" and produces additional ""red"" outputs based on the number of words that follow it in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> ""red"", and for every word following ""wif"" in a sequence, add an additional ""red.""",0.8,7,wif
"Observing the examples provided, each time the nonce word ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is reflected in the corresponding output sequence. Additionally, each other word in the input seems to correspond with a unique color output as well.

Let's analyze the provided examples:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue"".

2. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

3. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red red"".

4. zup lug -> yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

5. zup wif zup -> yellow red yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Given all the examples, it's clear that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow"". 

There might be extra rules for the repetition of colors (like ""walm"" seems to repeat colors), and for the sequence of colors (""wif"" being red in one instance and red red red in another), but with the given examples, we cannot precisely determine those rules without more data.

In conclusion, the rule for ""zup"" is:
zup -> yellow.",1.0,7,zup

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,7,zup
"Observing the patterns in the input and output sequences, we can try to match words in the input to colors in the output. Let's align each input with its respective output:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
2. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
3. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red

5. zup wif zup -> yellow red yellow

From these alignments, we can attempt to determine the rule for the word ""zup.""

In examples 1, 3, 4, and 5, whenever ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output color is yellow.

In example 2, ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow, but this time it's followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. However, this does not break the pattern as ""lug"" after ""zup"" still has ""zup"" yielding yellow.

No other input word appears to consistently produce yellow as an output in the present examples.

Therefore, the rule we can induce from these examples is:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output. 

Thus: zup -> yellow.",1.0,7,zup
"From the given examples, we can infer the following color associations:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> red or green, but red is more likely given that ""dax"" is always green, and ""walm"" outputs red when ""dax"" is not present.

We can now examine the use of ""zup"" in the examples:

1. In the first example, between ""wif"" and ""bluf"" which produce red and blue respectively, ""zup"" produces a yellow output.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" and ""lug"" are present without ""zup"", and they output green and blue respectively. When we add ""zup"" before ""lug"", the output for ""lug"" remains blue, but ""walm"" changes to yellow, indicating ""zup"" has an influence on the output color for ""walm"".

3. In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""walm"", producing green, yellow, and yellow. This indicates that ""zup"" is likely influencing the first ""walm"" to output yellow instead of red.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" directly precedes ""lug"" and the output is yellow and blue, with ""lug"" staying consistently blue.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" and then ""zup"" again, and the output is yellow, red, yellow. Given that ""wif"" consistently outputs red, we can infer that ""zup"" is responsible for the yellow output.

From the given data, we can deduce that ""zup"" outputs yellow when it stands alone or when it precedes any color-associated nonce word. There is no instance provided where ""zup"" follows another nonce word, so we cannot deduce how ""zup"" would behave in that position based on the current examples.

Based on this information, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow (when preceding any given color-associated nonce word or standing alone).",0.9,7,zup
"Observing the pattern in the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a color, and more specifically, it tends to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. Let's analyze each example:

2. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue

Rule: bluf represents the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,7,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color that follows it in each input sequence. In other words, it seems to take on the color of the word that comes after it in the list. We can verify this by checking the outputs corresponding to each input:

1. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   Here, bluf is followed by zup and the corresponding color is yellow, which is the color output for bluf.

2. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that follows bluf.",0.8,7,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to ""blue"" in certain cases and ""red"" in others. The use of ""bluf"" doesn't exhibit a consistent one-to-one mapping with a single color. However, a pattern can be observed if we look at the words immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Looking at instances where ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue,"" we notice the following:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue"" again.

When ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" we see:

- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" gives us ""red red.""

This suggests that ""bluf"" might mirror the color of the word that precedes it. To confirm this, the fourth example is particularly useful, where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red,"" consistent with ""wif"" being ""red."" 

However, in the fifth example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" results in ""blue yellow yellow green,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" but results in ""yellow"" instead of ""blue"" or ""green."" If the rule was simply that ""bluf"" mirrors the preceding color, we would expect ""lug zup bluf dax"" to result in ""blue yellow blue green."" This breaks the pattern.

Upon closer inspection and considering the last piece of evidence, one can surmise that ""bluf"" might be a wildcard term that adapts to match the color of a particular surrounding context, perhaps the nearest color in the sequence, but not exactly the one that precedes it.

Given the conflicting instances and the last example that breaks the initial pattern, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word that immediately follows it, except when that word is ""dax."" When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes on the color that precedes it. This is consistent across all examples in the sequence:

- Immediate following color when not followed by ""dax"":
  - ""bluf zup"" results in ""yellow yellow"" (Second example).
  - ""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow"" (Fifth example).
  
- Preceding color when followed by ""dax"":
  - ""lug bluf dax"" results in ""blue blue"" (Third example).

Therefore, one potential rule for ""bluf"" could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color value of the following word unless the following word is ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" takes the color value of the preceding word.",0.8,7,bluf

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the previous color. The more times ""walm"" appears, the more repetitions there are. For instance, when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated. There appears to be no repetition when ""walm"" is followed by a new word that is not ""walm,"" such as ""wif.""

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated the same number of times as the original color's occurrence before the introduction of ""walm."" If ""walm"" follows another ""walm,"" the repetition continues based on the last actual color word mentioned.

Examples:
- ""lug walm wif"" -> ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times before ""wif"" introduces red.
- ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times before ""wif"" adds red.
- ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times before ""wif"" introduces red, and then ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
- ""lug walm"" -> ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.

Applying this rule to the examples:

- In ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""zup"" is before the first ""bluf"", and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" translates to yellow in this instance.

- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" is before ""bluf"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, making ""bluf"" translate to blue.

- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", ""wif"" is before the ""bluf"", and ""wif"" corresponds to red, which makes ""bluf"" translate to red.

- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" and translates to red, so ""bluf"" means red here as well.

- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", ""wif"" is before the first ""bluf"" and ""dax"" is before the second ""bluf"". ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" corresponds to green, so the first ""bluf"" means red and the second means green.

Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,8,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is a nonce word representing a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" 

To illustrate, here's a breakdown of each example:

1. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red."" The word ""wif"" (which outputs ""red"") occurs immediately before ""walm,"" and then ""red"" is repeated three times.
   
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif"" (which outputs ""red"") again comes just before ""walm,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times. The word ""bluf"" (which outputs ""yellow"") occurs before ""wif,"" which does not impact the repetition mediated by ""walm.""
   
3. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow"") occurs right before ""walm,"" leading to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
   
4. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow green green green blue red."" In this case, ""dax"" (which outputs ""green"") precedes ""walm,"" leading to ""green"" being repeated three times.
   
5. ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" (which outputs ""red"") once again comes just before ""walm,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.

From this pattern, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be output three more times for a total of three repetitions.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times.",1.0,8,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repeated output of color words. We can reach this conclusion by observing the pattern:

- Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup dax walm lug wif -> Output: yellow green green green blue red
- Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow

In every example, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. To create a general rule from these patterns, I observe the following:

1. ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that would be output from the word right before it.
2. The number of repetitions depends on the position of ""walm"" – it creates one fewer repetition than its position in the sequence (excluding the ""walm"" itself).

Using this analysis, I will define the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color word equivalent of the word that comes directly before it, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence minus one.",0.9,8,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word in the Input seems to correlate with a specific color in the Output. To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the occurrence of ""walm"" across different inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first Input (""zup wif walm""), ""walm"" is followed by three occurrences of the color red in the Output.
- In the second Input (""zup bluf wif walm""), ""walm"" is again followed by three occurrences of the color red.
- In the third Input (""lug wif dax zup walm""), ""walm"" leads to three occurrences of the color yellow.
- In the fourth Input (""zup dax walm lug wif""), ""walm"" is followed by three occurrences of the color green.
- In the fifth Input (""wif walm zup""), ""walm"" is followed by another three occurrences of the color red.

Seeing the pattern, ""walm"" appears to relate to repeating the next color in the sequence three times. It is not the word ""walm"" itself that directly corresponds to a specific color, but rather it influences the next color word to repeat its corresponding color three times in the Output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next color word to output its corresponding color three times.",0.8,8,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in each example. It appears that ""walm"" affects the output sequence. Comparing the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can notice how the presence of ""walm"" and other words affect the colors and their order in the output. By examining each instance, we can try to establishes a correlation:

- When ""walm"" appears with ""zup,"" the output always includes ""yellow"" and multiple ""red.""
- When ""walm"" appears with ""wif,"" the output includes multiple ""red.""
- In the presence of ""dax,"" green is introduced into the sequence, and its occurrence increases with each instance of ""dax.""
- When ""walm"" appeared without ""zup,"" no ""yellow"" was present initially; however, ""yellow"" returned when ""zup"" was introduced later in the same input.
- The sequence that has a number of the same colors typically ends with the sequence of identical colors, suggesting ""walm"" may affect the repetition or multiplication of a specific color in the output.

Considering the patterns above, we can infer that ""walm"" may mean repetition or multiplication, possibly suggesting the output should repeat the preceding color. The color that needs to be repeated appears to be determined by other words, with ""wif"" suggesting red, ""dax"" suggesting green, and ""zup"" implies yellow.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color indicated by the word or words immediately preceding it in the sequence. If ""wif"" is immediately before it, the repeated color is red; if ""dax"" precedes it, the repeated color is green; if ""zup"" comes before it, the repeated color is yellow. If ""walm"" is followed by words that indicate a color, it seems to cause the preceding color indicators to repeat until a new color is indicated.",0.8,8,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the recurrence of the word and its corresponding output:

1. wif walm (red red red) appears in all instances.
2. zup wif walm (yellow red red red) - Adding ""zup"" adds yellow at the beginning.
3. zup bluf wif walm (yellow yellow red red red) - Adding ""bluf"" adds another yellow before the sequence of reds.
4. lug wif dax zup walm (blue red green yellow yellow yellow) - The sequence ends with three yellows.
5. zup dax walm lug wif (yellow green green green blue red) - ""walm"" is followed by three greens before ""lug wif.""
6. wif walm zup (red red red yellow) - ""zup"" after ""walm"" changes the last red to yellow.

It appears that ""walm"" translates into a repetition of the color that follows it or precedes it. In cases 1, 2, 3, and 6, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is multiple reds. In case 4, ""walm"" is before zup, resulting in three yellows following. In case 5, ""walm"" is before ""lug wif,"" resulting in three greens preceding.

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
- Other words correlate with other colors consistently as well: ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue"", ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and ""wif"" with ""red"".
- The output color does not seem to be dependent on the position of the word within the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red,1.0,9,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color red. In each instance where ""wif"" is used, the output includes the color red in the corresponding position. Here is how ""wif"" operates in each example:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax lug."" The output sequence has red at the third position, which is where ""wif"" is placed in the input sequence, surrounded by blue and green, which correspond to ""lug"" and ""dax,"" respectively.
- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" also corresponds to red.
- The third and fourth examples follow the same pattern, where ""wif"" is directly translated to red.
- The fifth example solidifies this idea as ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" and since ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" must stand for red.

"Rule: bluf -> green

Explanation: In all given examples, whenever the word ""bluf"" is present, the output color is green. There is a consistent one-to-one relationship between the occurrence of ""bluf"" and the color green in the outputs provided, indicating that ""bluf"" translates to the color green.",1.0,9,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green when it immediately follows the word ""dax,"" and to the color blue when it immediately follows the word ""lug."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""wif,"" it does not seem to correspond to a consistent color, as those combinations precede different colors in the given outputs.

Here is the breakdown of each example:

- In the first example: ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green,"" and ""zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue."" This indicates ""bluf"" translates to green after ""dax"" and to blue after ""lug.""
- In the second example: ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow,"" which does not indicate a specific color for ""bluf.""
- In the third example: ""dax bluf"" once again corresponds to ""green green,"" reinforcing the rule that ""bluf"" translates to green after ""dax.""
- In the fourth example: ""dax bluf"" is again ""green green,"" further supporting the same rule.
- In the fifth example: ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" which supports the rule that ""bluf"" translates to blue after ""lug.""

Therefore, the rules we can induce for the meaning of ""bluf"" are as follows:

Rule:
bluf -> green when preceded by ""dax""
bluf -> blue when preceded by ""lug""
In other contexts, the meaning of ""bluf"" is not consistent based on the given data.",0.8,9,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.",0.4,9,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. None of the contexts in which ""bluf"" appears changes its output, suggesting it has a consistent meaning unrelated to the surrounding words.

Rule: bluf -> green",0.0,9,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color ""green.""",0.0,9,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll look at its use in varied contexts and the corresponding outputs.

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
3. dax walm wif -> green green green red

The word ""walm"" is always followed by repeating the color associated with the preceding word the same number of times as the number of letters in ""walm"". For example:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and since ""walm"" has four letters, the output is ""yellow"" repeated four times.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and again, because ""walm"" has four letters, the output is ""green"" repeated four times.
- When another word like ""wif"" follows ""walm"", the pattern established by ""walm"" is broken, and we switch to the color associated with ""wif"" (red).

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

**walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the prior word as many times as there are letters in the word ""walm"" (four times in these examples).**

Rule: If ""walm"" precedes another color word, it repeats the associated color of the word before it four times (the number of letters in ""walm""). If it is followed by another color word, the new word's color is then presented as many times as appropriate after the sequence of ""walm.""",1.0,9,walm
"From the provided examples, we can infer the following:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" and ""walm"" is iterating the color mentioned before it thrice.
   
2. When ""lug wif walm"" is input, the output is ""blue red red red."" Here, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" so ""walm"" appears to repeat the color mentioned directly before it three times.

3. In the case of ""dax walm wif,"" the output is ""green green green red."" This suggests ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" repeats that color three times before ""wif"" adds the color ""red"" to the sequence.

Therefore, ""walm"" is not a static word with a fixed meaning; instead, it designates a rule where it causes the color mentioned directly before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the prior color mentioned three times.",1.0,9,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will examine the repetition of words in the output relative to the existence of the word ""walm"" in the input:

- Each time ""walm"" is present in the input, there is a repetition of a color word in the output.
- The number of repeats of the color word corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input string.
- When ""walm"" is the second word, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" is the third word, ""red"" is repeated four times.
- When ""walm"" is at the end after two different words, ""green"" is repeated three times but is followed by ""red"".

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to relate to the repetition of color words, and the specific color word and the number of repetitions seem to be influenced by additional factors, such as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence and the context provided by the words preceding it.

Rule: walm -> causes the output of a color word to be repeated a number of times based on its position in the input sequence. The specific color associated seems to depend on the preceding word(s), which are not enough in the given examples to fully deduce the system behind choosing the specific color.",0.8,9,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'walm,' let's analyze the patterns and differences in the input and corresponding output:

- Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: lug wif walm | Output: blue red red red
- Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red

From the above examples, each time 'walm' appears, the output consists of a repetition of three colors that seem to correspond to the word before 'walm.' For instance:

- 'zup' leads to 'yellow yellow yellow'
- 'lug' leads to 'red red red' (although 'wif' has been introduced in the sequence, which produced 'blue' in the output)
- 'dax' leads to 'green green green'

'Walm' doesn't change the color but seems to relate to the quantity, specifically the repetition of the color associated with the word before it, three times. The output color which does not follow this threefold pattern appears to correspond to an additional word in the input ('wif' leading to 'blue' and 'red' depending on its position).

Therefore, the rule associated with 'walm' seems to be that it indicates a repetition of three for the color associated with the previous word in the input.

Rule: walm -> triggers the repetition of the associated color three times.",0.8,9,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup walm"" always results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red""
- ""dax walm wif"" gives ""green green green red""

We can observe that the output always consists of three words that are the same, followed by a fourth that is different, except for the second example where ""walm"" is preceded by two different words which produce four words in total with the last three being the same.

In the first and third example, ""walm"" is the last word, while in the fourth example, ""walm"" is in the middle. When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" an additional ""red"" appears at the end of the sequence. This suggests that ""wif"" contributes to a ""red"" output, and that ""walm"" seems to contribute to the repeating of a color based on the first word.

However, given that the result is always three of the same color followed by a fourth that differs, ""walm"" could be a command or function that multiplies the color associated with the preceding word by three, and if followed by ""wif,"" it might add an additional ""red"" to the end.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times, if followed by ""wif"" add ""red"" at the end.",0.8,9,walm

"Given the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. This suggests that ""dax"" correlates directly to the color green. Other words in the inputs also correlate to specific colors, but since the task is focused on defining ""dax,"" we will not deduce the meanings of other words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,10,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in a sequence.",1.0,10,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green"" consistently across all examples. Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> ""green""

Rule: The word ""dax"" signifies the color green.",1.0,10,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""dax"" can be inferred as follows:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" as there is no other context and ""bluf"" presumably translates to ""green"" as well.

- The second example, ""lug dax wif lug,"" translates to ""blue green red blue,"" and considering ""lug"" appears twice and translates to ""blue"" both times, it reinforces that ""dax"" is ""green.""

- In the third example, we see multiple words and their corresponding colors. ""dax"" appears at the end, before the last ""lug"" and based on the output, ""dax"" again seems to translate to ""green.""

- The fourth example is just ""dax,"" with the output being ""green,"" which supports the previous deductions.

- The fifth example, ""dax wif bluf,"" translates to ""green red red,"" which again suggests ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""bluf"" again correlates with ""red.""

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: dax -> green.",0.9,10,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the term ""wif"" appears to translate to ""red."" Each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,10,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns and corresponding outputs in the examples provided.

- `lug` consistently corresponds to `blue`.
- `dax` consistently corresponds to `green`.
- `bluf` consistently corresponds to `red`.
- `walm` corresponds to `red` when following ""wif"" but `green` when following ""dax.""

Comparing the first and second example, ""zup wif lug wif"" translates to ""yellow red blue red"". Since ""wif lug"" in the first example gives us ""red blue,"" we might infer that ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red,"" and that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" However, we also need to account for the fact that there is a ""wif"" at the end of the input in the second example, which corresponds to ""red"" at the end of the output. 

Considering the third example, we can see that multiple instances of ""wif lug"" lead to multiple instances of ""red blue,"" further suggesting that ""wif"" could be tied to the color ""red.""

In the fourth and fifth examples, we must consider ""wif bluf"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red red"" each time. This could reaffirm the rule that ""wif"" adds a ""red"" to the output, and the ""bluf"" following ""wif"" contributes another ""red.""

Given these examples and the outputs, we can induce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Thus, we can state the rule as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,10,wif
"Based on the given examples, ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" To confirm, let's examine the relationship between each input and its respective output:

1. wif lug dax -> red blue green
2. zup wif lug wif -> yellow red blue red
3. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
4. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
5. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red

In all of these examples, whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. None of the other input words reliably correspond to ""red"" in the output, and ""wif"" never corresponds to any other color.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,10,wif
"Analyzing the input-output pairs to understand the meaning of ""wif"":

1. ""wif lug dax"" maps to ""red blue green""
2. ""zup wif lug wif"" maps to ""yellow red blue red""
3. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" maps to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" maps to ""green green green red red""
5. ""dax lug wif bluf"" maps to ""green blue red red""

From the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and produces ""red blue,"" but we cannot determine the meaning of ""wif"" solely from this. In the second example, ""wif"" appears both after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" and both instances of ""wif"" map to ""red."" The third example again shows that ""wif"" maps to ""red"" regardless of its position, and the fourth and fifth examples confirm this pattern.

The rule deduced from the examples is:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""",1.0,10,wif
"Observing the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking for patterns associated with it and its conversions to other words.

In the first example:
- ""wif lug dax"" converts to ""red blue green."" 

In the second example:
- ""zup wif lug wif"" converts to ""yellow red blue red.""

In the third example:
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" converts to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue.""

In the fourth example:
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" converts to ""green green green red red.""

In the fifth example:
- ""dax lug wif bluf"" converts to ""green blue red red.""

From these, we can deduce the following rules for the word ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""lug"", or after ""walm"", it converts simply to ""red"".

Given these observations, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" when followed by another word. However, if ""wif"" is followed specifically by ""bluf"", it leads to a repetition, resulting in ""red red"".

The rule seems to be that ""wif"" on its own means ""red"". However, if ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output rule changes so that ""red"" is repeated.

Rule: wif -> red (with a special doubling rule when followed by ""bluf"": wif bluf -> red red)",0.8,10,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples provided and identify patterns corresponding to the known output colors.

1. Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
2. Input: zup -> Output: yellow
3. Input: lug dax zup -> Output: blue green yellow
4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: wif zup lug wif -> Output: red yellow blue red

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, a ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The word ""zup"" alone translates to a single ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is combined with other words like ""dax,"" it follows the color associated with ""dax,"" but maintains its own color representation ""yellow"".

Rule:
zup -> yellow

This means that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the presence of other words.",1.0,10,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Therefore, ""zup"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the sequence or by other words around it. It behaves like a constant in all given examples.

Thus, the rule is: zup -> yellow.",1.0,10,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the input-output pairs:

1. Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
2. Input: zup -> Output: yellow
3. Input: lug dax zup -> Output: blue green yellow
4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: wif zup lug wif -> Output: red yellow blue red

From (1) and (2), we see that ""zup"" by itself translates to ""yellow,"" and the addition of ""dax"" then translates to ""green"" which follows ""yellow."" This could imply that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" but let's consider the rest of the data to ensure this is consistent:

- In (3), ""lug dax zup,"" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" followed by ""dax,"" which again leads to ""green,"" and finally, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
- In (4), ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" we see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The sequence of ""zup walm"" leads to a duplicated ""yellow"" (""yellow yellow yellow"") at the end, potentially indicating some form of repeated output, but ""walm"" does not have a direct mapping since it's following ""zup.""
- In (5), ""wif zup lug wif,"" the pattern holds with ""wif"" for ""red,"" ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" for ""blue.""

Considering the consistency across all these examples, we can induce that ""zup"" directly corresponds to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,10,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce what the meaning or rule associated with the word ""zup"" is. Here are the observations:

- When ""zup"" appears alone (Example 2), the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" appears after another word (Example 1: ""dax""; Example 3: ""lug dax""; Example 4: ""wif"" and ""lug dax""), the output is ""yellow"" following the output for the other words.
- In Example 4, ""zup"" appears twice consecutively and results in two ""yellow"" outputs in a row.
- The appearance of ""zup"" does not seem to affect the color output for other words; it consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

From these observations, it seems that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" in the Outputs, irrespective of its position or the surrounding context.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,10,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each unique word corresponds with a unique color. Given this pattern, the word ""zup"" consistently produces the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input string.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,10,zup
"From the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the word ""bluf."" Let's analyze each instance:

1. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
2. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
5. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green

In examples 1 and 5, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" while in example 2, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""wif."" In example 3, ""bluf"" alone after ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Example 4 shows ""bluf"" at the end preceded by ""lug"" corresponds again to ""blue,"" even if other words and colors are in between.

Given the sequences, we could induce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word before it. To affirm this, we should check whether ""bluf"" always matches the color of the preceding word:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
5. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red

In all these cases, the color assigned to ""bluf"" is the same as the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word that precedes ""bluf.""",1.0,10,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the last word mentioned before bluf. If bluf is the first word, it repeats the color of the next word.

Examples:

- ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"" because the last word before bluf is 'zup', which corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow"" because the last word before bluf is 'wif', which corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because the last word before bluf is 'lug', which corresponds to the color blue. If bluf appears first, it takes the color of the next word, which is also 'lug' in this case.
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" because each bluf corresponds to the color of the last word before it; in the first instance, it is 'lug' which is blue, and in the second instance, it remains 'lug' which is still blue.
- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green"" because the last word before bluf is 'zup', which corresponds to the color yellow.

Therefore:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" mirrors the color denoted by the word preceding it. 

First example: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and when followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red yellow"". Hence for this instance, ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""red"".

Second example: ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"", reinforcing the interpretation that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the preceding word.

Third example: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", followed by ""bluf"", resulting in ""blue blue"", which again supports the idea that ""bluf"" matches the color indicated by the word before it.

Fourth example: ""lug"" meaning ""blue"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output pattern is ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". As before, ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding term, except for the instance following ""wif"", which means ""red""; therefore, ""bluf"" here becomes ""red"", implying it changes based on the preceding color.

Fifth example: Consistent with the prior examples, ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the preceding word; ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". 

Rule: bluf -> mirrors the color denoted by the preceding word.",1.0,10,bluf
"Analyzing the outputs in relation to the input, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. ""Bluf"" is clearly associated with a color output. We can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" based on its output color in different contexts:

In the first and second examples, ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" and ""wif."" However, in the third example, ""bluf"" on its own corresponds to ""blue."" This might indicate an exception to the rule or a contextual dependency.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" yet its output is ""blue,"" indicating that its color output is not influenced by ""lug.""

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" yet again and corresponds to ""yellow,"" reinforcing the observation from the first and second examples.

By considering these points, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it follows ""wif"" or ""zup."" When it is preceded by ""lug"" or stands alone, it corresponds to the color ""blue.""

So, the rule we can define for bluf is:

bluf -> blue or yellow, depending on the context (following ""wif"" or ""zup"" results in yellow, while following ""lug"" or standing alone results in blue).",0.9,10,bluf
"Based on the examples given, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. In examples where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (example 1 and example 5), ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" This suggests that when ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" it takes on the color associated with ""wif.""

2. In example 2, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" again and translates to ""red,"" the color corresponding to ""wif."" This supports the observation from the first point.

3. In example 3, where ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" might mirror the color that ""lug"" represents, which is ""blue.""

4. In example 4, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" again, and it translates into ""blue."" Hence, it mirrors the color associated with the preceding word once more.

Seeing as ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color of the word that comes before it, the rule that can be induced is that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",0.8,10,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to be a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. We can determine this because every time ""walm"" is used, the output color repeats the color translated from the word before ""walm"".

For instance:
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" implying that ""walm"" translates to repeating “red” since ""wif"" means red.
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" repeats the yellow from ""zup"".
- When multiple colors are present before ""walm"" (as in ""wif zup lug dax zup walm""), the color that is repeated is the one immediately before ""walm"", hence ""yellow yellow yellow"" after the second ""zup"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the output associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,10,walm
"walm -> meaning

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. Here's the rule based on the examples:

Rule: Whatever color corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"", output it three times.",1.0,10,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: The output for ""walm"" is to repeat the color indicated by the word just before it multiple times (the number of repetitions is the same as the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input).

Explanation: In the given examples, every time the word ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. 

- In Examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" showing that ""walm"" causes the word ""red"" to be repeated three times. 
- Example 3 has ""zup"" before ""walm,"" and since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Example 4 shows that each word has its corresponding color and ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" hence the output ends with ""yellow yellow yellow"" as ""zup"" indicates yellow.
- In Example 5, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" The output after ""dax"" begins with three instances of ""green,"" aligning with the rule that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color from the previous word.",1.0,10,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" To illustrate:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" suggesting ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The third example confirms this pattern by showing a string of different words followed by ""walm,"" and the output repeats the color corresponding to the word before ""walm,"" which is ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"").

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to be three instances of the color associated with the word that comes right before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,10,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the word immediately before it multiple times (three in the first examples and as many times as the preceding color word appears in the ""dax walm zup lug dax"" example).

Looking at each example:

- In the first and second examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and since ""zup"" appears twice before ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" following the two instances of the word ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and repeats the color ""green"" only once as ""dax"" appears only once before ""walm.""

According to this pattern, ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word as many times as that word appears before walm. If the preceding word is not associated with a color or only appears once before ""walm,"" then the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times.",0.8,10,walm

"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs. Let's corroborate the findings through the given examples:

From these examples, whenever ""lug"" appears, the output always includes ""blue."" In cases where there's only one output for one instance of ""lug,"" like example 4, ""blue"" is the sole output. When there are multiple words in the input, ""blue"" follows ""lug,"" but is not necessarily the immediate next word in the output, suggesting that other words in the sequence influence the position of the color in the output sequence.

To further support the assumption, let's evaluate the instances without ""lug"" and their outputs:

- Input without ""lug"": wif walm -> Output: red blue blue
- Input without ""lug"": zup walm wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow red red
- Input without ""lug"": wif zup dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow green yellow yellow yellow
- Input without ""lug"": dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow

In these examples where ""lug"" is not present, ""blue"" either doesn't appear or it doesn't solely correspond to a single word repeatedly.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it indicates that the color outputted just before ""walm"" should be repeated additionally, with the total number of repetitions being one more than the number of times the color has appeared in sequence prior to ""walm."" If the color has not been repeated prior to ""walm,"" it will appear twice in the output after ""walm.""

Examples to support the rule:
1. In the first input ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and is followed by ""walm,"" which leads to ""yellow"" being repeated once more, for a total of two occurrences of ""yellow"" in the output.
2. In the second input ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" is shown as ""red"" and is repeated three times before ""walm."" Therefore, after ""walm,"" we get ""red"" repeated once more, resulting in four instances of ""red"" in output.
3. In the third input ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated two more times after ""walm,"" resulting in three instances of ""blue"" in the output since it wasn't already repeated.
4. In the fourth input ""zup wif dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Before ""walm,"" there is no repetition of ""green,"" so ""walm"" results in repeating ""green"" twice in the output.
5. In the fifth input ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and since there are no repeating colors before ""walm,"" it is repeated three times after ""walm"" in the output.",1.0,12,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example, the sequence ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" might have something to do with repeating the previous color. However, since there are two ""yellow"" following the ""walm,"" it does not seem to be a simple repetition.

2. In the second example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red blue blue,"" which again indicates a repetition since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" but it is not a direct repetition as there are two blues following ""walm"".

3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""blue"" twice.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" further suggesting that ""walm"" makes the previous color repeat twice.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" supporting the idea that ""walm"" may be causing the previous color to repeat two more times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color word just before it to repeat two additional times. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word just before it two additional times.",0.9,12,walm
"To identify what walm means, let's analyze the occurrences of walm and the corresponding output.

1. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
2. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

Looking at these examples, when walm appears, the color that follows it is repeated one extra time compared to the pattern seen prior to walm. Additionally, the next color seems to always be one step back in this observed sequence: blue -> green -> yellow -> red -> blue ...

Let's test this:

- For the 1st example, walm inserts an additional yellow, and the following color is blue, which is the previous color in the sequence of yellow -> blue.
- For the 2nd example, walm results in an extra blue, and the following color is also blue, consistent with the sequence of red -> blue.
- For the 3rd example, walm results in two additional blues, and there is no subsequent color to check the sequence, but the addition rule holds.
- For the 4th example, walm inserts two additional greens, and the sequence red -> green is also maintained.
- For the 5th example, walm results in two more reds, and again there is no subsequent color, but the addition rule holds.

Rule: walm -> When walm appears in the input, a color that follows it appears an additional two times, and the next color (if there is one) is the previous color in the sequence blue -> green -> yellow -> red -> blue.",0.9,12,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" translates to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"".
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
- ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green"".
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"".

Observing the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions varying in each case:

- In the first example, ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated twice after ""walm"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" (red) is repeated two times after ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" (blue) is repeated twice after ""walm"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" (green) is repeated two times after ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" (red) is repeated two times after ""walm"".

However, there is one discrepancy in the second example, where ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""walm"" and the output is three reds instead of two as seen in other examples. If we assume this could be a typographical error in the output and it should have been two reds instead of three, the rule still holds.

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word that it follows to be repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word two times.",0.8,12,walm
"Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is consistently included in the output. This indicates that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,13,lug

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds with ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,13,lug
"To induce the meaning of ""lug,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Considering the outputs following ""lug,"" we notice that ""lug"" always produces ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" alone translates to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green.""

Given these examples, one clear pattern emerges: regardless of context, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue."" The presence of other words in the input sequence (like ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""walm"") correspond to other colors, but ""lug"" remains unchanged.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,13,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", let's examine its occurrence in the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. dax bluf wif -> green green red
2. dax -> green
3. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
4. dax -> green
5. dax -> green

From these examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,13,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the term ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence or the presence of other words. This suggests that ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" independently of other factors in these examples. Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,13,dax
"From the examples you provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence or the presence of other words. Given this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

This means the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the provided context.",1.0,13,dax
"Based on the given examples, where ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green,"" we can induce that ""dax"" signifies or triggers the output ""green."" Therefore, we have:

dax -> meaning. Rule: Whenever the input includes ""dax,"" the output will include ""green.""",1.0,13,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""dax"" correlates to the output ""green"" consistently, regardless of the context in which ""dax"" appears. It is observed that every time the word ""dax"" is presented as an input, the corresponding output is ""green.""

Here is the pattern that emerges from the examples:

- In the first and third inputs where ""dax"" is present alongside other words, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" while the other words (""bluf"" and ""zup"") correspond to different colors in the output.
- In the second, fourth, and fifth examples where ""dax"" is the only input, the output remains ""green.""

Hence, we can conclude the rule for ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green. When ""dax"" is presented as input, the corresponding output color is green.",1.0,13,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, ""red"" appears in the output. Other words in the inputs correspond to different colors, but ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

2. wif zup -> red yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. The other words also seem to have a one-to-one correspondence with colors; for instance, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color yellow when converted from the nonce language to English.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,13,zup

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore:
zup -> yellow",1.0,13,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in the output. Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input results in the word ""yellow"" in the output. Other words may have their own color correspondences as well, such as ""wif"" to red and ""walm"" to yellow, but regardless of the context, ""zup"" consistently means yellow.",1.0,13,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- The presence of ""zup"" does not change the color associated with other words; for instance, ""walm"" consistently results in ""red"" being output, except when ""zup"" is encountered before it (as seen in example 4, where ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""), indicating that ""zup"" affects or overrides the output for words that follow it.
- The input ""zup lug"" leads to ""yellow blue,"" meaning that ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and the presence of ""zup"" before it does not change this association.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", and when ""zup"" precedes another word, it overrides the default color associated with that word to yellow unless the word has a strong association with a different color (as seen with ""lug"").",0.8,13,zup
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color that comes from the word directly before it. For example, given ""zup bluf,"" if ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" as well. Similarly, if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red."" Hence:

bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,13,bluf
"bluf -> yellow when preceded by 'zup', red when preceded by 'wif', and green when preceded by 'dax'. The meaning of bluf changes depending on the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: Bluf takes on the color associated with the word directly preceding it.",1.0,13,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" gets translated to the same color as the word that directly precedes it. The output always duplicates the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"". Here are the detailed observations supporting this rule:

- In the first and third examples, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and both result in ""yellow yellow"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and the result is ""red red"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for that sequence is ""green green"".
- Finally, the fifth example includes ""bluf"" twice, each time following a different word (""zup"" and ""wif"" respectively), and in both cases, ""bluf"" adopts the color of the preceding word (""yellow"" and ""red"").

Using these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf"" in the input sequence.",1.0,13,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color word that immediately precedes it.

Supporting Observations:
1. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" – ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
2. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" – ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
3. The repetition of ""zup bluf"" with the same translation confirms the pattern.
4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green"" – ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
5. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"" – the first ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the second “bluf” follows “dax” (green), aligning with the established pattern. However, this input does not contain a second ""bluf,"" which suggests that there may be a transcription error in the task description. Assuming that the sequence and resulting translation should make sense with the established pattern, if a second ""bluf"" is inserted after ""dax,"" the output would correctly follow the pattern with ""green green"" after ""dax.""

bluf -> The color word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,13,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the examples given:

- When ""zup bluf"" is input, the output is ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup.""

- When ""wif bluf"" is input, the output is ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif.""

- The third example is identical to the first, providing further evidence that ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and is followed by ""green."" Since none of the previous ""bluf"" instances were followed by a color, and the pattern seems to be based on the word immediately preceding ""bluf,"" this suggests that ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""

- The fifth example features multiple words followed by ""bluf"" at different points, and the output seems to follow the pattern of the word before ""bluf"" determining its corresponding color.

Considering these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Hence, if ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow,"" and if it follows ""wif,"" it becomes ""red,"" if it follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green,"" and if it follows ""lug,"" it becomes ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.",0.9,13,bluf
"Walm -> green when preceded by ""dax,"" red when preceded by ""wif,"" blue when preceded by ""lug,"" and yellow when preceded by ""zup.""

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in an input, it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times in the output.",1.0,13,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""

The word ""walm"" does not have a consistent corresponding color. Instead, its effect on the output seems to be to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it, three times. Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: If X is the word before ""walm,"" and the output color for X is Y, then the output for ""walm"" is Y Y Y.",1.0,13,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" dictates the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. For example, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times. In the case of ""wif walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times, and for ""lug walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times. When ""walm"" is not immediately preceded by a color word, as seen in the second example, it does not seem to repeat a color but rather continues the color pattern that is already established.

Here is the rule I am inducing:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times in the output. 

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,13,walm
"Rule: walm -> the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Explanation:
- 'dax walm' outputs 'green green green' – the word before 'walm' is 'dax', which corresponds to 'green'.
- 'wif lug zup walm wif lug' has 'zup' before 'walm' and outputs 'yellow yellow yellow' – 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.
- 'wif walm' has 'wif' before 'walm' and outputs 'red red red' – 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.
- 'zup lug walm' has 'lug' before 'walm' and outputs 'blue blue blue' – 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.
- 'lug walm' has 'lug' before 'walm' and again outputs 'blue blue blue' – 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.

Therefore, walm repeats the associated color of the word immediately before it three times.",1.0,13,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze its occurrence in different contexts and the respective outputs.

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" This suggests that ""walm"" might result in the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

2. In the sequence ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""wif lug,"" and the output pattern after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow red blue."" If we match the colors to the words, we can see that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" This again suggests that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the colors that correspond to the words immediately following it.

3. ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red,"" and ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" This further supports the idea that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color of the preceding word.

From the examples provided, we can infer a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it.

Therefore: walm -> causes repetition of the preceding word's associated color.",0.8,13,walm

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,14,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,14,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we must look for patterns associated with this word in the input and the corresponding color in the output. We can compare the inputs and outputs where ""wif"" is present to understand how it is translated into color:

1. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
2. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

In all cases, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output. Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,14,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the consistent pattern across the examples:

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Observations:
1. Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding color in the output is ""red.""
2. ""wif"" does not seem to depend on position since it results in ""red"" regardless of whether it is at the beginning or the end of the input sequence.
3. No other input word consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,14,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to analyze the provided inputs and outputs systematically.

Looking at each example:

1. Input: `wif walm zup` -> Output: `red red red yellow`
2. Input: `lug dax walm wif` -> Output: `blue green green green red`
3. Input: `wif bluf dax` -> Output: `red red green`
4. Input: `wif bluf lug zup` -> Output: `red red blue yellow`
5. Input: `zup bluf wif walm` -> Output: `yellow yellow red red red`

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can observe the following patterns related to ""wif"":
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, a ""red"" is present in the corresponding output.
- The position of ""red"" in the output correlates to the position of ""wif"" in the input.

It doesn't seem to matter the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence; its presence guarantees one ""red"" in the output at the corresponding position.

Considering this analysis, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs, independent of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore:

wif -> red",1.0,14,wif
"Reviewing the provided examples, it's possible to discern a pattern for the nonce word ""wif"" and the corresponding color in the output:

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" follows in the output. Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the sequence (beginning, middle, or end), ""red"" is the consistent output color. Meanwhile, other words in the sequence lead to different colors (for instance, ""walm"" leads to ""red"" twice, ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow"" twice, ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" once, and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" twice).

Hence the rule regarding the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red",1.0,14,wif
"Analyzing the examples, we can deduce that each word seems to be associated with a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,14,wif
"To determine the meaning of 'zup', let's analyze each pair of input and output and look for patterns.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- Here 'dax walm' corresponds to 'green green green', so 'zup walm' translates to 'yellow yellow yellow'. This suggests that 'zup' on its own corresponds to the first 'yellow'.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- 'zup' corresponds to the first 'yellow', and 'wif' produces three 'red' outputs.

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'lug' to 'blue'.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- With 'zup lug' corresponding to 'yellow blue' and 'dax wif bluf' to 'green red red', we see that 'zup walm' corresponds to 'yellow yellow yellow'.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'zup lug' to 'yellow blue', 'wif' to 'red', and the second 'lug' to 'blue'.

The consistent pattern we see is that 'zup' always corresponds to the color 'yellow'. However, it must be noted that the number of times 'yellow' is repeated correlates to the word that follows 'zup'. When 'zup' is followed by 'walm', 'yellow' is repeated three times, and when followed by 'lug', it's not repeated but rather followed by the 'blue' corresponding to 'lug'.

Our rule induction based on these observations is:

Rule: 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' and is followed by the color associated with the next word.
- If 'zup' is followed by 'walm', repeat 'yellow' three times.
- If 'zup' is followed by any other word, it's just a single 'yellow' followed by that word's corresponding color.

According to the given data, the meaning of 'zup' in the context appears to be:
zup -> yellow",1.0,14,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns of input and corresponding output:

- Whenever ""zup"" is present, it results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.
- The output color does not seem to depend on the position of ""zup"" within the input sentence. ""Zup"" always maps to ""yellow"" whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the sequence.

Now, let's analyze the additional context provided by the other words:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to a sequence of three ""yellow,"" except when preceded by ""zup,"" where it leads to only one ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" translates to a sequence of three ""red.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

The consistent factor when ""zup"" is in the input is that ""yellow"" appears in the output, suggesting that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears. There doesn't seem to be any additional effect on the quantity or sequence of colors in the output that correlates specifically with the presence of ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,14,zup
"Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,14,zup
"Based on the given examples:

- ""dax walm zup walm"" correlates with ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" marks a transition point where the color sequence changes from green to yellow.
- ""zup wif walm"" correlates with ""yellow red red red,"" indicating that ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and the following words determine the next colors.
- ""zup lug"" correlates with ""yellow blue,"" reiterating that ""zup"" denotes yellow and is followed by another color, blue, associated with ""lug.""
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" correlates with ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" where ""zup"" consistently marks yellow. Additionally, subsequent words represent their colors.
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" correlates with ""green yellow blue red blue,"" where ""zup"" again is paired with yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow. The term ""zup"" consistently represents the color yellow in the provided sequences.",1.0,14,zup
"Rule: ""zup"" serves as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the immediately following word, but shifts the color one step ""back"" in a sequence before starting the repetition.

For instance:
- ""dax walm zup walm"" means green (for ""dax"") followed by a sequence for ""walm"" which is yellow. The command ""zup"" makes it start from green (one step back in the sequence) and then continue with yellow.
- ""zup wif walm"" would normally be red (for ""wif"") and yellow (for ""walm""), but ""zup"" changes that to a sequence starting from yellow (one step back from red) and then red repeated as the instructions from ""wif"".
- ""zup lug"" translates to a step back from blue, which is yellow, followed by blue.
- In the input ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", ""zup lug"" becomes yellow and blue, ""zup walm"" makes it start from green before going to yellow, then ""dax wif bluf"" continues with their corresponding colors green, red, and red.
- For ""dax zup lug wif lug"", ""dax"" is green, ""zup lug"" would go back one from blue to yellow and then to blue, followed by ""wif"" and ""lug"" with their associated colors red and blue.

So, zup -> Causes a repetition of the color assigned to the next word, starting with the color one step before in a specific sequence. The sequence seems to be from the context: (yellow -> green -> red -> blue).",0.8,14,zup
"To deduce the meaning of 'bluf', let's analyze the output colors corresponding with the presence of the word 'bluf' in the input.

1. When ""dax zup bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green yellow yellow"". The color green is associated with ""dax,"" and yellow is associated with ""zup"", suggesting that ""bluf"" may also correspond to yellow here since there is no new color introduced.

2. ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"". The repetition of the color blue corresponds to the repeating words ""lug"" and ""walm,"" while ""wif"" appears to translate to red. Since ""bluf"" appears once and the color red appears twice, it seems that ""bluf"" may induce a duplication of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

3. With ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red"". Similar to the previous point, ""bluf"" appears to induce a duplication of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

4. ""wif bluf dax lug"" gives us ""red red green blue"". Here, ""wif"" is again red, and ""dax"" and ""lug"" have been consistent with green and blue, respectively. It seems that ""bluf"" has doubled the red color which comes from ""wif"".

5. Finally, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", which again shows a duplication effect caused by ""bluf"".

From these observations, we can conclude that the word ""bluf"" results in the duplication of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Causes duplication of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,14,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word bluf corresponds to a certain color pattern output, specifically the word 'red' being repeated twice. When we have 'bluf' in an input, the corresponding output always ends with 'red red', regardless of the other words in the input and their related colors.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: 'red red'.",1.0,14,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced by observing its output in correlation with other words and their respective outputs. Let us analyze each of the examples to determine the rule:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   In this case, ""lug"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Here, ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In all cases, we see that the word ""bluf"" does not have a single corresponding color, but rather it repeats the color of the preceding word. 

Rule:
bluf -> Repeats the output color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence.",1.0,14,bluf
"Considering the given examples, we are looking for a pattern that transfers the inputs (which includes the nonce word ""bluf"") to a series of colored outputs. Upon examining the data, it appears that non-""bluf"" words correspond to specific colors consistently:

- The word ""dax"" always corresponds to green in the output.
- The word ""zup"" always corresponds to yellow in the output.
- The word ""lug"" always corresponds to blue in the output.
- The word ""walm"" always corresponds to green when combined with ""dax"" and blue when combined with ""lug"".
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to red when combined with ""bluf"" and blue when combined with ""lug"".

When ""bluf"" is presented, the output pattern includes a repetition of the color that precedes it:

- If the color before ""bluf"" is green (""dax""), ""bluf"" translates to two yellows.
- If the color before ""bluf"" is blue (""lug walm""), ""bluf"" translates to two reds.
- If the color is not defined before ""bluf"" (as in the case of ""zup bluf""), ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, which is yellow.

However, there is an inconsistency: in the case of ""lug walm wif bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to two reds even though the color blue (from ""lug"") is before ""wif"". This suggests that ""wif"" only corresponds to red when directly followed by ""bluf"", which makes the last color before ""bluf"" red. When ""bluf"" is followed by another word as in ""wif bluf dax lug"", ""bluf"" still translates to two reds, meaning that the presence of ""wif"" immediately before ""bluf"" dictates the output.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be generalized as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs a color sequence that repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it, unless that word is ""wif"", in which case ""bluf"" outputs two reds.

Accordingly, in its simplest form:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is a repetition of the last color mentioned before ""bluf"" or red if ""wif"" directly precedes it.",0.9,14,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples, let's examine the input-output pairs and identify possible patterns:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" produces ""green yellow yellow.""
2. ""lug walm wif bluf"" produces ""blue blue blue red red.""
3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" produces ""green green green red red.""
4. ""wif bluf dax lug"" produces ""red red green blue.""
5. ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow.""

Based on these examples, we can notice the following:
- The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green."" It is always followed by or precedes the color green in the output.
- The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow."" It is always followed by or precedes the color yellow in the output.
- The word ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue."" It is always followed by or precedes the color blue in the output.
- The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"" and is always followed by or precedes the color red in the output.
- The word ""walm"" doesn't have a direct color association since it appears alongside different colors in the outputs, but it seems that its presence augments the repetitions of the colors corresponding to the adjacent words.
- When ""bluf"" appears in the input, it is followed by a repetition of the preceding color in the output.

Now let's apply this pattern to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"":
- In examples 1, 2, and 5, ""bluf"" follows a color-associated word and results in the repetition of that color.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" and results in ""red red.""
- In example 4, however, ""bluf"" is followed by another color word ""dax"" and does not directly translate to an immediate color in the output.

These observations lead to the following rule for the meaning of ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word in the sequence of output colors. If ""bluf"" is the first word or follows a non-color word, this rule may require further examples to be accurately determined.",0.8,14,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the input-output pairs and derive patterns that correspond to the application of ""walm."" We notice that ""walm"" seems to make the previous color word repeat three times in the output. This can be observed each time ""walm"" appears in the sequence. Let's break it down with each input case:

- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" apparently is ignored, ""wif"" yields one ""red"" and ""walm"" causes the ""red"" from ""wif"" to repeat two more times.

- Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green
""lug"" yields ""blue,"" ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""dax"" yields one ""green"" and ""walm"" causes the ""green"" from ""dax"" to repeat two more times.

- Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
""dax"" yields one ""green,"" ""walm"" causes the ""green"" from ""dax"" to repeat two more times, and ""wif"" adds one ""red"".

- Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""wif"" yields one ""red,"" ""walm"" causes the ""red"" from ""wif"" to repeat two more times.

- Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""wif"" yields ""red,"" ""dax"" yields one ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the ""green"" from ""dax"" to repeat two more times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color word before it three times in the output. Described in a rule form:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word immediately before it three times in the output.",1.0,14,walm
"From the given examples, we can try to determine the pattern that leads to the output colors. Let's examine the pattern for each word and their corresponding color output:

- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red.""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue"" in the one instance it is used.
- ""dax"" always results in ""green.""

When ""walm"" is in the input, it seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it but triples the output. For example:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) directly and results in ""green green green.""

Given that the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color of the previous word in triple, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,14,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup bluf wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug zup dax,"" the output is ""blue yellow green green green.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow red red red.""
5. When ""walm"" follows ""zup wif dax,"" the output is ""yellow red green green green.""

Let's map the colors for each word based on what we can deduce:

- ""zup"" is consistently producing ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is consistently producing ""red.""
- ""dax"" is consistently producing ""green.""

Now, looking at the outputs where ""walm"" is present, we notice that ""walm"" duplicates the color output of the word that comes before it, producing three instances of that color.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it replicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, outputting that color three times.

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color of the preceding word, producing three instances of that color.",1.0,14,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

Here are the examples along with their outputs:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
3. dax walm wif -> green green green red
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green

Taking a closer look at the outputs, we can try to associate each input word with the colors in the output. We see that:

- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

However, when ""walm"" is included in the input, the color following the word that comes just before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

For example:

- In Example 1, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""
- In Example 2, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green.""
- In Example 5, ""dax walm"" again corresponds to ""green green green.""

Therefore, it seems the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times in the output.",1.0,14,walm
"From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word 'walm'. Let's analyze each example:

Example 1:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'bluf' corresponds to 'yellow' again, and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'. The word 'walm' coincides with a repetition of the color 'red' two additional times.

Example 2:
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'zup' to 'yellow', and 'dax' to 'green'. The word 'walm' seems to result in 'green' being repeated two more times.

Example 3:
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'. The word 'walm' between 'dax' and 'wif' results in 'green' being repeated two more times before 'red' appears.

Example 4:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red'. After 'walm', 'red' is repeated two more times.

Example 5:
Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', and 'dax' to 'green'. After 'walm', 'green' is repeated two more times.

Rule:
Based on the examples provided, the rule behind the nonce word 'walm' appears to be that it causes the color corresponding to the last mentioned color word to be repeated two additional times. If 'walm' appears at the end of the input, it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" is consistent and straightforward:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears as a single input, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" appears in a sequence with another word, such as ""dax lug bluf dax"", the output for ""lug"" is still ""blue"", while the other words (dax, bluf) appear to have their own associated colors.

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be as follows:

- In the multiple occurrence cases, the output ""red"" is repeated for each instance of ""wif.""
- When ""wif"" appears with other words, like ""bluf"" or ""lug,"" it precedes them in the output as ""red,"" suggesting that it does not change its output meaning based on adjacent words.

- If ""bluf"" follows a word that has not been individually associated with a color (like ""walm"" or ""zup""), it seems to take the color of the word before (""walm"" and ""zup"" assumed to be ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively in these examples).

Therefore, it can be deduced that ""bluf"" implies a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it.",1.0,15,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" correlates to repeated outputs of the last color listed before ""bluf"". Here is the breakdown of the examples:

1. Example: wif bluf dax walm  
   Output: red red green green green  
   Rule: ""wif"" outputs red, and the last color before ""bluf"" is red; therefore, ""bluf"" repeats the red twice more.

2. Example: dax wif dax zup bluf  
   Output: green red green yellow yellow  
   Rule: ""zup"" outputs yellow, and the last color before ""bluf"" is yellow; therefore, ""bluf"" repeats the yellow twice.

3. Example: wif dax bluf  
   Output: red green green  
   Rule: ""dax"" outputs green, and the last color before ""bluf"" is green; therefore, ""bluf"" repeats the green once more.

4. Example: wif walm lug bluf  
   Output: red red red blue blue

5. Example: lug bluf  
   Output: blue blue

"From the given examples, we can observe that the occurrence of the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the output having two consecutive colors that are the same. Moreover, the color that is duplicated appears to correspond with the word that is immediately preceding ""bluf."" Let's examine the relationship in each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the word that occurs immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. bluf duplicates the corresponding color of the word before it.",1.0,15,bluf
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to doubling the color coded for the word that comes immediately before it. Here are the observations based on the provided examples:

1. In the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" resulting in a double ""red"" in the output.
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence a double ""yellow"" in the output.

5. In the fifth and last example, the word ""bluf"" follows immediately after ""lug,"" and the output is double ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that appears directly before ""bluf"" in the input.

Hence, ""bluf"" triggers a duplication of the color connected to the preceding word.",0.8,15,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, where ""walm"" is used, the output contains a series of a single color word repeated three times. At first glance, the fact that this color repeats three times might suggest that ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of the preceding word three times"".

So, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

To check this rule:

- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, and the output is ""green green green.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, and the output is ""red red red.""
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

"walm -> repeated color of the preceding word. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color indicated by the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.",1.0,15,walm
"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by looking at the pattern of outputs. 

In the first example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"". The repeated color suggests that ""walm"" might indicate repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it.

In the second example, ""lug walm wif lug"", we see ""blue blue blue red blue"". Since ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", it further supports the idea that ""walm"" causes repetition. The word ""wif"" then leads to ""red"", and ""lug"" appears again without ""walm"", resulting in a single ""blue"".

The third example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"", outputs ""blue red green green green yellow"". Again, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

The fourth example, ""wif walm"", outputs ""red red red"". ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and it once again indicates a repetition of the color associated with ""wif"" which is ""red"".

Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup walm wif"", we have ""yellow yellow yellow red"". ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated.

Rule: walm indicates that the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it should be repeated three times. Hence, it acts as a command for triple repetition.

walm -> causes the preceding word's corresponding color to be repeated three times.",1.0,15,walm
"Based on the examples given:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" implying that ""walm"" follows or intensifies the color associated with the preceding word. Since ""dax"" equates to ""green,"" ""walm"" seems to replicate that color akin to an echo effect.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" generates ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" following ""lug"" produces additional ""blue"" outputs before moving on to ""wif,"" which correlates with the color ""red.""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" produces ""blue red green green green yellow."" This is consistent with the previous findings; ""dax"" refers to ""green,"" and ""walm"" after ""dax"" echoes the ""green"" multiple times.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" reinforcing that ""walm"" replicates the color of the preceding word, which in this case is ""red.""
- ""zup walm wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" indicating ""zup"" associates with ""yellow"" and ""walm"" replicates this color before ""wif"" changes it to ""red.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" acts as a rule that replicates the color denoted by the preceding word in a sequence of three. It repeats the color attribute of the word it immediately follows.

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color attribute of the previous word in a sequence of three times.",1.0,15,walm
"By examining the provided examples, we can attempt to discern the pattern or rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. In the first example, `dax walm` translates to `green green green`. Here we have ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" leading to ""green"" repeated three times.

2. The second example, `lug walm wif lug`, becomes `blue blue blue red blue`. ""Walm"" here is followed by another word (wif) and then ""lug"" is repeated; this results in ""blue"" being repeated but interrupted by ""red"" before the last ""blue"".

3. For `lug wif dax walm zup`, the translation is `blue red green green green yellow`. We see ""walm"" again followed by a string of the same color ""green"" after ""dax"".

4. `wif walm` translates to `red red red`, indicating a repetition of ""red"" after ""wif"".

5. Finally, `zup walm wif` is `yellow yellow yellow red`. Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow"" repeated, then ""red"" after ""wif"".

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" seems to cause the color word immediately following it to be repeated three times. However, when ""walm"" is the last word, its output color seems to be the same as the preceding color word but repeated three times. Let's summarize:

- When there is a color word in front of ""walm,"" the color associated with that word is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" is the final word, the color from the word right before it is repeated three times.
- In the single occurrence where ""walm"" is not the last word and is followed by another color word, ""wif"" (which translated to ""red"") interrupts the repetition of the color set by ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last mentioned color, for three iterations, unless interrupted by the occurrence of a different color word. Interrupting seems to switch the repetition to the interrupting color.

Rule: walm -> Causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times. If another color word follows ""walm,"" the color will be switched to the color of the immediately following word for its occurrence, and then the pattern resumes with three repetitions of the interrupted color.",0.8,15,walm

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,16,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,16,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word in the Input translates to a specific color in the Output. Each word is consistently mapped to the same color across different examples. To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can look at the color it maps to in each Output.

Here are the mappings we can derive from the examples:

- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Looking at the word ""wif"" and the color output each time:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which translates to red, and the Output starts with red.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is the first word, and the Output starts with red.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is the last word, and the Output ends with red.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes before ""lug"" (blue), and the Output is red followed by blue.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is second, and the color is red in the second position in the Output.

Since in every case ""wif"" corresponds to red in the Output, we can conclude that:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,16,wif

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. In every input example, when ""wif"" appears, the output includes a red. In contrast, the other words correspond to different colors and do not consistently correspond to red in the output.

"Based on the examples given, it appears that there is a pattern where the word ""bluf"" results in repeating the last color word mentioned before it, indicating that ""bluf"" acts as a command to duplicate the previous color output.

Here's the pattern observed in your examples:

- In the first input ""lug bluf zup"", ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue"", and ""bluf"" immediately follows, resulting in another ""blue"" before continuing to ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"".
- The second input also follows this pattern: every time ""bluf"" appears, the color just before it is duplicated in the output (e.g., ""wif"" -> ""red"", and then ""bluf"" leads to another ""red"").
- This pattern holds for the remaining examples as well.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the last mentioned color in the output.",1.0,16,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. In these examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color immediately preceding its use, with an additional color red at the end.

It consistently adds the color red as a second element after replicating the preceding color. 

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it and adds red to the output.",1.0,16,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red red

Explanation: In every example, the word 'bluf' consistently translates to 'red red,' regardless of the surrounding words or the position of 'bluf' in the input sequence. This indicates that 'bluf' does not change in meaning based on context in these examples and instead has a fixed translation.",1.0,16,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the last color mentioned before it, with the amount of repetition depending on the number of syllables in the preceding color word(s).

For example:
- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" is ""blue"" which has one syllable, so ""bluf"" means ""blue"" repeated once: ""blue blue"".
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", the last color mentioned before ""bluf"" is ""green"" (""wif""), which has one syllable, so ""bluf"" means ""red red"".
- In ""wif bluf"", the last color mentioned is ""red"" (""wif""), which has one syllable, so ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"".

Applying this rule to the last provided input:

- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is ""yellow"" which has two syllables, but since the last ""zup"" is directly followed by ""bluf"" without a different color word in between, ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" repeated just once, as if the ""zup"" is counted once in this context.

bluf -> a repetition of the last color mentioned before it, with the number of repetitions equal to the last color word's syllable count, unless the ""bluf"" directly follows the color word, in which case it is only repeated once.",0.8,16,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red repeated the number of times the preceding unique color words appear before it. For instance, if there's one unique color (e.g., blue) before bluf, then bluf means red red.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs and its corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup | Output: green red red red blue yellow
5. Input: lug walm zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Looking at the instances of ""walm,"" we see the following patterns before and after its appearance:

- ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The number of repetitions appears to be twice, creating a trio with the original instance. Given the above examples, notice that the word before ""walm"" has the same color repeated twice more after ""walm"" in the output:
  - dax (green) walm -> green green green
  - lug (blue) walm dax (green) lug (blue) -> blue blue blue green blue
  - lug (red) walm lug (blue) -> red red red blue
  - wif (red) walm lug (blue) zup (yellow) -> red red red blue yellow
  - lug (blue) walm zup (yellow) wif (red) -> blue blue blue yellow red

Rule: walm -> the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it two more times, making a sequence of three of the same color.",1.0,16,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color immediately following it should be repeated until a different color is encountered or the sequence ends. Here's the rule derived from the provided instances:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which implies ""walm"" causes ""green"" (from ""dax"") to repeat.
- In the second example, ""lug walm dax lug"" leads to ""blue blue blue green blue,"" showing the ""blue"" from ""lug"" repeated because of ""walm"" until a new color ""green"" (from ""dax"") is mentioned.
- In the third example, ""wif walm lug"" produces ""red red red blue,"" indicating ""red"" from ""wif"" is repeated due to ""walm"" until ""lug"" introduces a new color, ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue,"" with ""red"" from ""wif"" continuing up to the ""lug,"" which changes it to ""blue.""
- The fifth example, ""lug walm zup wif,"" turns into ""blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, ""blue"" from ""lug"" is repeated due to ""walm"" until ""zup"" changes the repeating color to ""yellow,"" followed by a new color ""red"" from ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color given by the previous word until a different color word appears.

Rule: Repeat the previous color until a new color is introduced.",1.0,16,walm
"The examples provided seem to indicate that the word ""walm"" represents a color change rule. To derive the rule, let's look at the input and outputs more closely:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
From this example, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it, as ""dax"" is green and the following ""green"" is repeated twice more.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Here, ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm"" the color blue is repeated two more times before changing with the new word ""dax,"" which is green.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Again, the word ""wif"" is red and after ""walm,"" the color red is repeated two more times before changing with the new word ""lug,"" which is blue.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
In this example, the word ""wif"" is red and after ""walm,"" the color red is repeated two more times before changing again with ""lug"" to blue.

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red
Here, the word ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated twice more before changing with the new word ""zup.""

Rule:
From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated twice more before the pattern is broken by a new word that represents a different color.

walm -> repeat the color of the previous word two additional times.",0.9,16,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can see a pattern emerging with regard to the occurrences of the nonce word ""walm"" and the corresponding output:

1. In ""dax walm"", ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with ""dax"", which is green.
2. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with ""lug"", which is blue.
3. In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with ""wif"", which is red.
4. In ""dax wif walm lug zup"", ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with ""wif"", which is red.
5. In ""lug walm zup wif"", ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with ""lug"", which is blue.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> causes the next mentioned color to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",0.8,16,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must first compare the outputs among the various inputs, focusing on the position where ""walm"" appears:

1. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green
   Walm translates to green given that ""dax"" also translates to green.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Walm occurs after ""lug"" which translates to blue, and before ""dax"" which translates to green, resulting in ""walm"" being translated as blue.

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Walm occurs after ""wif"" (red) and before ""lug"" (blue), resulting in ""walm"" being translated as red.

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow
   Walm occurs after ""wif"" (red) and before ""lug"" (blue), resulting in ""walm"" as red.

5. Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   Walm occurs after ""lug"" (blue) and before ""zup"" (yellow), thus ""walm"" is blue.

From these comparisons, we can induce the following pattern:

Rule: The word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it. If ""walm"" is the first word and has no preceding color, then it defaults to green.

Now, let's create the rule.

- In ""zup wif lug dax,"" ""wif"" is again translated to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,17,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,17,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" within this context, we must observe the relationship between the input and output sequences.

From the first example:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
The word ""wif"" appears before ""walm"", and ""dax"" follows it. Both ""wif"" and ""walm"" have the output red, while zup has the output yellow, which is different. ""Dax"" has the output green.

From the second example:
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
The sequence here has ""walm"" followed by ""dax"", while ""lug"" precedes it. We can see that ""dax"" consistently outputs green, but the outputs for ""walm"" are influenced by the word that comes before it. In this case, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", and both have the output blue. 

From the third example:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, the word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and both have the output yellow.

From the fourth example:
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
""Dax"" precedes ""walm"" and both have the output green.

From the fifth example:
Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and both have the output yellow.

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word:

Rule: The output color for ""walm"" matches the output color for the word immediately before it.

So we can deduce that:

walm -> The output color for ""walm"" is the same as the output color for the word immediately before it.",0.8,17,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the color outputs associated with its occurrence in each example, as well as the context in which it is used among other words. Here are the observations:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""red,"" while ""wif"" that precedes it and ""dax"" that follows it are associated with ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively.
2. In the second example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" where ""lug"" is linked with ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The output for ""walm"" is also ""blue.""
3. In the third example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" is at the end, preceded by ""zup,"" which has an output of ""yellow."" The output for ""walm"" is also ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif,"" ""walm"" is in the middle, with ""dax"" before it and ""wif"" after it, both outputting ""green."" ""walm"" here also outputs ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" is after ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" The output for ""walm"" here is also ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it appears that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. However, the fifth example seems to contradict this since it precedes ""lug,"" which outputs blue but ""walm"" outputs yellow. This contradiction could be due to the presence of another word between ""walm"" and ""lug,"" which is ""zup,"" outputting ""yellow.""

Considering all these, the rule for ""walm"" seems to follow the color of the word that immediately precedes it, except in the case where ""walm"" is the last word, where it might replicate the preceding color, which in the case of the examples is always ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word, with a possible exception that when it is the last word, it may take on the color yellow by default.",0.8,17,walm
"Based on the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, we can infer a pattern to determine the meaning of ""walm."" Each example alternates in pattern of colors which seems to correlate with the placement of ""walm"" and other words.

Looking at the examples:

1. When ""wif"" appears, the output is green followed by a red. This can be observed in each example.
   
2. ""dax"" consistently corresponds to green.

3. ""zup"" consistently corresponds to yellow.

4. ""lug"" seems to consistently correspond to blue.

5. ""bluf"" seems to switch between red and yellow based on its position (it is red when followed by ""dax"" and yellow when not).

Now, analyzing the mentions of ""walm"":

- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs red) and is followed by ""dax"" (which outputs green). The output for ""walm"" here is another red.
  
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which outputs blue) and precedes ""dax"" (which outputs green). The output for ""walm"" here is a blue.

- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which outputs yellow) and there are no words after ""walm"". The output for ""walm"" here is yellow.
 
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" (which outputs green) and ""wif"" (which precedes a red). The output for ""walm"" is green.
  
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" (which outputs yellow) and ""lug"" (which outputs blue). The output for ""walm"" is yellow.

The pattern that can be deduced is that ""walm"" takes on the output color of the preceding word when there is a word that follows it which has a consistent output color we know (like ""dax"", ""lug"", ""zup""). When ""walm"" is the last word or is followed by a word like ""bluf"" whose output color can change, ""walm"" takes on the color output related to ""zup"" which is yellow.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" could be described as follows:

Rule: walm -> Outputs the same color as the preceding word if followed by a word with a known consistent output color. Outputs yellow when last or followed by a word with a variable output color.

Using the rules above, we can summarize the meaning of ""walm"":

walm -> meaning: duplicate the output color of the preceding word, default to yellow if last or if the rule is not applicable.",0.8,17,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look for patterns related to ""walm"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""walm"" is associated with the output ""red.""
- In the second example, we cannot directly associate ""walm"" because there are multiple instances of ""dax"" and ""wif"" which correspond to different colors. However, we notice that ""red"" does not appear at all when ""walm"" is included.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow"" which is the same color as ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is again followed by ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" which is the same as ""zup.""

The outputs tend to repeat certain colors, and the presence of ""walm"" seems to affect the color output. Analyzing the patterns:

- ""walm"" leads to a ""red"" output when followed by ""dax.""
- ""walm"" does not lead to a ""red"" output when there are no instances of ""dax"" following it.
- ""walm"" is followed by the color of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is present elsewhere in the input.
- When ""walm"" is not followed by ""dax"" or preceded by ""zup,"" or when ""lug"" is present as in the fifth example, it takes the color of the word before it, which is ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can infer a potential rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" is in the input sequence, the color output varies based on the surrounding words:
1. If ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""red.""
2. If ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup.""
3. It's uncertain how ""walm"" affects the output in the presence of ""lug,"" as we have conflicting information (blue in the second and yellow in the fifth example).
4. In the absence of more definitive patterns for ""lug,"" we cannot establish an exact rule for ""walm"" when it appears with ""lug.""

Given the limited examples and the rule's uncertainty in certain cases, we can tentatively suggest the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> The output color for ""walm"" is ""red"" when it is followed by ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or ""lug"" in the absence of ""dax."" In other contexts, its color output is less certain and requires more examples to determine a rule.",0.7,17,walm
"Analyzing the given examples and the associated outputs, it seems that each word correlates to a specific color. To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its appearance in different contexts.

- In example 1, ""walm"" results in red.
- In example 2, ""walm"" results in blue, but there's also ""dax"" which results in alternating colors green, blue, then green again.
- In example 3, ""walm"" results in yellow.
- In example 4, ""walm"" results in red, similar to example 1.
- In example 5, ""walm"" results in yellow, similar to example 3.

It's also noteworthy that the presence of other words like ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to certain colors consistently within this context, indicating that different words are associated with specific colors. However, the output color for ""walm"" changes, indicating that the color it is associated with is likely dependent on its position or the words surrounding it.

From the examples:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" corresponds to red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" or is at the end of the input, it corresponds to yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it corresponds to blue.

It seems we are missing a case where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or precedes ""bluf"" to determine if there is a specific rule for those cases.

With the given examples, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" may depend on the word that appears immediately before it. However, more examples would be needed to fully ascertain this rule. Based on the current information, we can state:

Rule: ""walm"" has a color output that is dependent on the context or position in the sequence, but with the given data we can infer the following:

- Preceded by ""wif"" -> red
- Preceded by ""dax"" -> blue
- Preceded by or followed by ""lug"" or at the end of the input -> yellow

Therefore, we cannot define a single-color output for ""walm"" without additional context. This is an incomplete rule induction and additional data is needed to refine the rule.",0.5,17,walm

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue"".",1.0,18,lug
"From the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a particular color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

"dax -> meaning. Meaning is the color green.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each input word correlates with a specific color in the output:

- wif -> red

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,18,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red' regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the pattern indicates that 'wif' stands for the output color 'red' consistently.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,18,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. 

Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. In each example, regardless of the position or context of ""wif"" within the sequence, it consistently results in ""red"". Other words correspond to other colors (""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" to blue red red), but ""wif"" is solely associated with red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,18,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following associations for the other nonce words before deciphering the meaning of ""wif"":

- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""

Now looking specifically at the use of ""wif"" in each input and output pair:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" (which means red) and is followed by another word which isn't ""wif"". So in this case, ""wif"" is also red.

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and is followed by ""walm"" again. The output for ""wif"" in this instance is also red.

3. Input: wif lug wif
   Output: red blue red
   Here ""wif"" is first and last, and both are red. It is in-between ""lug"", which is blue.

4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   ""wif"" follows ""dax"", which is green, and ""wif"" itself is red.

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   ""wif"" follows ""zup"", which is yellow, and ""wif"" itself is red.

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" irrespective of its position or neighboring words in the sequence.

Thus, the rule can be written as:
wif -> red",1.0,18,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red.",1.0,18,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: When ""zup"" is used in an input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output. If followed by other words, ""zup"" maintains its meaning (""yellow""), and the following words are translated to other colors as observed from the given input-output pairs:

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the word ""bluf."" We can see that every time ""bluf"" is used in the input, ""red"" is produced twice in the output.

Rule: Each non-nonce word seems to correspond to a color. ""zup"" corresponds with yellow, ""lug"" with blue, ""walm"" and ""dax"" with green, and ""wif"" with red. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it is translated into the color blue. Therefore, ""bluf"" means blue.",1.0,18,bluf

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes all the subsequent words (and itself) to be translated to the same color that the previous valid (non-walm) word was translated to. This continues until another non-walm word appears in the sequence.

For example:
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""walm"" causes the reiteration of ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" continues that with ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" continues the ""red"" until ""dax,"" which changes it to green.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to signify repetition of the last color word mentioned before it. In each case, the color that precedes ""walm"" is repeated a certain number of times in the output. Here is an analysis of the examples given:

1. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm

   ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and after the word ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.

5. Input: lug walm

In the second example, ""lug"" is blue, and following ""walm,"" there are two additional ""blue"" outputs.

In the third example, ""wif"" is red, and after ""walm,"" there are two ""red"" outputs.

In the fourth example, ""wif"" is red, and following ""walm,"" we see two additional ""red"" outputs.

"Based on the examples provided:

- ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green"", where ""lug"" appears first and is translated as ""blue"".
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" appears first and is translated as ""blue"". ""walm"" is repeated, also translating to ""blue"".
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"", where ""lug"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup"" and translates to ""blue"".
- ""zup lug wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue red green blue"", where ""lug"" is preceded by ""zup"" and translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"", where ""lug"" is preceded by ""bluf"" and ""walm"" and both times translates to ""blue"".

"Rule: lug -> blue

Each occurrence of the word ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,19,lug
"Rule: lug -> ""blue"" repeated the number of times the word that follows lug appears in the entire input.

Explanation:

- In the first input, ""dax walm"" appears once each, so ""blue"" is repeated three times, one for ""dax"" and two for ""walm"".
- In the second input, ""walm"" appears once, so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the third input, ""zup walm"" appears twice, so ""blue"" is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""zup walm"".
- In the fourth input, ""wif dax lug"" each appears once, therefore ""blue"" is followed by ""red green blue"" respectively for each of those words.
- In the fifth input, ""walm dax lug"" each appear once (not counting the current ""lug"" for output), and ""wif zup bluf"" appears once each, so ""blue"" is followed by ""red yellow yellow"", and then repeated three more times for ""walm dax lug"".",1.0,19,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

From the examples provided, every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Thus, we can deduce that ""lug"" means blue.",1.0,19,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" dictates the color blue and the repetition of that color based on the occurrence of certain other words which seem to correspond to other colors. Each word seems to correlate to a color as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue (repeated for the number of 'lug' occurrences + the number of 'walm' occurrences following it)

The rule for ""lug"" can thus be formulated as:

Rule: When ""lug"" appears, output ""blue"" repeated once plus an additional ""blue"" for each occurrence of ""lug"" and ""walm"" after the appearance of ""lug"".

To validate this rule, consider the given examples:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" has one 'lug' followed by one 'walm' without another 'lug' in between. Therefore, the first 'lug' gets translated into ""blue blue blue"".

2. ""lug walm"" contains one 'lug' followed by a 'walm', leading to repetition of ""blue"" three times because there is no additional 'lug' in between.

3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" converts to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"" because 'lug' appears only once, and there is only one 'walm' after it with no additional 'lug' in between, resulting in a single ""blue"" followed by three ""yellow"".

4. ""zup lug wif dax lug"" has the 'lug' appear twice, but the second 'lug' does not have a 'walm' after it. The first 'lug' results in ""blue"", while the second 'lug' still simply translates to ""blue"" without repetition as there's no 'walm' after it.

5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" means we have ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"", where the ""blue blue blue"" sequence follows the first 'lug' because it has one 'walm' afterwards, and the last 'lug' turns into ""blue"" without repetition as it does not have a 'walm' after it.

Based on the examples provided, the rule seems consistent. Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" can be inferred as:

lug -> blue, followed by as many additional ""blue""s as there are instances of ""lug"" and ""walm"" following it, up to the next occurrence of ""lug"".

This inferred rule is subject to validation with additional examples not provided here.",1.0,19,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of what other words are present, ""dax"" always results in ""green."" 

The rest of the output does not seem to provide a clear pattern connecting the other nonce words (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf"") to specific colors consistently across examples. Without additional context or examples, we cannot reliably determine the rules for those words.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" based on the given examples is:

"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""dax"" appears to be consistently associated with the color 'green'.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif / Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" translates to ""green"".

5. ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow"" – `walm` after ""wif"" results in ""red"".

From these examples, it looks like the meaning of `walm` changes depending on the word that comes before it. It is reproduced as the color corresponding to that preceding word multiple times until a new word appears. If no word precedes it (as in example 2), it seems to default to repeating the color of the word following it.

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.,1.0,21,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can infer a pattern about what ""bluf"" represents. It seems to be related to the output color that follows the word ""bluf"" in each input:

- In the first input, ""wif"" is followed by two instances of the color 'red', and ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" may mean 'red'.
- In the second input, ""lug"" is followed by 'blue' and so is ""bluf,"" which may imply that ""bluf"" means 'blue'. This is contradictory to the first inference, indicating that the meaning of ""bluf"" might change based on context.
- In the third input, ""dax"" is followed by 'green,' and ""bluf"" precedes another 'blue'. So here, ""bluf"" appears to mean 'blue' again.
- In the fourth input, ""lug dax"" is followed by 'blue green,' and ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" yielding another 'green'.
- In the fifth input, ""zup"" yields 'yellow,' ""lug"" gives 'blue,' ""dax"" produces 'green,' and ""bluf"" is followed by a 'yellow', which links back to ""zup.""

The pattern appears to be that ""bluf"" is related to the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. If we examine closely, we can further deduce that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the next word's designated color. Here's the rule informed by this pattern:

Rule: ""bluf"" mirrors the color output of the following nonce word in the sequence. 

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" because ""wif"" outputs 'red'.
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" gives 'blue' which is the color associated with ""lug"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" outputs 'green' which is the color for ""dax"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" leads to 'yellow' which comes from ""zup"".

Therefore, the inferred rule is:
bluf -> the color of the word that comes after ""bluf"".",1.0,21,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to relate to the color output that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf."" Here is how it can be broken down:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- The pattern holds when ""dax"" is next to ""lug"" followed by ""bluf,"" as ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" and the sequence ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""
- This pattern also appears consistent with the input ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" where ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and the ""lug"" before ""dax"" and after ""bluf"" leads to ""blue green blue.""

Therefore, it appears that ""bluf"" acts as a sort of duplicator for the output color associated with the word that precedes it:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word twice.

Rule: If X is the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""bluf,"" then the word ""bluf"" results in the output ""X X.""",0.8,21,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the input/output pairs.

- Whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned after ""zup"", the output has an extra ""red"". ""zup wif bluf"" gives us ""yellow red red,"" whereas ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" gives us ""yellow yellow blue green blue,"" where the ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" and the sequence after does not have extra reds indicating that ""wif"" might be the trigger for the additional red.
  
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean ""blue"" in this context. This is further supported by the fact that ""lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue green green,"" which could indicate that ""bluf"" might still mean ""blue,"" but the rule for the output might depend on the preceding word(s).  
  
- When ""bluf"" is in between ""dax"" and ""lug"", as in the example ""dax lug bluf dax,"" the output is ""green blue blue green,"" where either ""dax"" or ""lug"" seems to lead to a green in the output.

- ""zup"" alone gives ""yellow"" on two occasions, confirming its color output as ""yellow"".

Given these points, it seems that ""bluf"" might be context-dependent. In contexts following ""lug,"" its output is ""blue,"" consistent with ""lug bluf"" and ""lug dax bluf."" However, ""dax"" followed by ""lug"" generates a ""green"" output, thus making it challenging to confirm the meaning of ""bluf"" without additional examples between ""dax"" and ""bluf."" 

With the given information, the most consistent rule regarding ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" directly or with ""dax"" in between, its output is ""blue."" In other contexts, the output color for ""bluf"" is not consistent and requires more examples to determine the exact rule. Therefore, we might tentatively define ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> blue (when following ""lug"" or ""lug dax"").",0.7,21,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the pattern of words in the input and their corresponding color outputs. By analyzing the examples provided, we can identify the rule that corresponds to ""walm.""

Looking at the examples:
1. ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" also corresponds to red, and ""walm"" results in the first deviation in pattern with green.
2. ""dax zup dax walm"" outputs ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to two different colors (green at the beginning and end), ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" at the end results in green again.
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow."" ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" leads to green again, and ""zup"" leads to yellow.
4. ""lug walm wif lug"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" is followed by red.
5. The last example is a repetition of the first, confirming the colors matched for ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax.""

From these observations, the word ""walm"" consistently results in the output color of green. Even when other words correspond to different colors in their second appearance, ""walm"" remains consistent in producing green. This constancy suggests the rule for ""walm"" is independent of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: walm -> green",1.0,21,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at instances where the word is used and observe the output pattern. Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: ""wif walm dax"" 
   Output: ""red red red green""
   
2. Input: ""dax zup dax walm"" 
   Output: ""green yellow green green green"" 

3. Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" 
   Output: ""red red red green yellow"" 

4. Input: ""lug walm wif lug"" 
   Output: ""blue blue blue red blue""

5. Input: ""wif walm dax""
   Output: ""red red red green""

From the above examples, after each occurrence of ""walm"" the color ""red"" is consistently followed by ""green"" regardless of the word that comes before ""walm"". The ""red"" pertains to the word ""wif"", and ""green"" seems to be associated with ""dax"", as seen in other positions within the sequences. 

However, in the second example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" the word ""dax"" is always followed by ""green,"" even when it comes before ""walm."" This indicates that the appearance of ""walm"" does not influence the output for ""dax"" to be ""green.""

By comparing the different inputs and outputs, it seems ""walm"" is not necessarily altering the output color of words around it but instead contributes its own color output of ""green"" to the sequence. This suggests that ""walm"" directly translates to ""green"" in this context.

Rule: walm -> green.",1.0,21,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" from the provided examples, we'll need to compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

From the first and last example, we can see that the input ""wif walm dax"" consistently results in ""red red red green,"" which indicates that the presence of ""walm"" likely causes the output following it to be ""green.""

Considering that:
- All instances of ""wif"" are followed by ""red.""
- Instances of ""dax"" are followed by ""green"" when preceded by ""walm,"" and with ""green"" again when ""dax"" leads in the sequence, suggesting it might generally correlate to ""green.""
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and it remains ""blue"" regardless of whether ""walm"" precedes it.
- ""zup"" follows by ""yellow,"" but only when it does not precede or follow ""walm.""

Combining these observations, it appears that ""walm"" affects the color output of the word that follows it in the sequence. More specifically, ""walm"" causes the following word to produce its inherent color output - ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" which indicates ""walm"" itself may not have a color associated with it but impacts the next word's output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it triggers or allows the following word to express its associated color, which aligns with the examples given:

- ""wif walm dax"" -> red red **red** green
- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> green yellow green green **green**
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red **red** green yellow
- ""lug walm wif lug"" -> blue blue **blue** red blue
- ""wif walm dax"" -> red red **red** green

Rule: walm -> allows the next word to express its associated color.",0.8,21,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of how it corresponds to the output in each example.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output after ""walm"" is red followed by green.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output after ""walm"" is green.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output after ""walm"" is red followed by green, with the next word ""zup"" corresponding to yellow.
4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output after ""walm"" is red followed by blue.
5. The fifth input is the same as the first one and the corresponding output is identical, serving as a confirmation.

Based on these observations, the word ""walm"" might transition the color sequence to red. The color after red seems to correspond to the color associated with the word that immediately follows ""walm."" Namely, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. It is also notable that ""walm"" always results in an additional color (red) irrespective of its position, which means it modifies or adds to the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> transitions output to red, followed by the color corresponding to the next word in the input sequence.",0.8,21,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the word ""walm"" within the given context, let's look closely at the correlation between the input and the output in each example:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax"", the output is ""red red red green"".
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" after a ""zup"", the output includes an extra ""green"".
3. In an input sequence with ""wif"", ""walm"", ""dax"", and ""zup"", the output is ""red red red green yellow"".
4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue blue red blue"".
5. The same input as the first example yields the same output sequence.

It appears that ""walm"" when presented in the sequence, directly corresponds to a color in the output sequence. It does not necessarily depend on the word that precedes or follows it in order to generate the output color.

The consistent part of the sequence is that ""walm"" always corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"", and to ""green"" when preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax"". However, ""red"" and ""green"" colors also appear without ""walm"" being present in the sequence, which implies that ""walm"" is not the only determinant of those output colors. 

However, because the color that ""walm"" corresponds to changes dependent on the preceding word, we can deduce that ""walm"" modifies the following color based on the context of the preceding word. Yet, we have insufficient data to fully understand the rule it follows beyond that it contributes to the color in the output. We need more variety in the sequences to isolate the precise rule for ""walm"".

Given the limited and repetitive examples, a tentative rule could be:

"Observing the given examples, it seems that the introduction of the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here's how it breaks down:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" which suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" is introduced, yellow is repeated two more times.
  
- ""lug walm zup"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow"" suggesting ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated twice more before moving on to the next color corresponding to ""zup"" which is yellow.
  
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"", which further supports the idea that the presence of ""walm"" means that the color of the word before it is repeated twice more. ""dax"" would then correspond to green.

- ""lug walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue"" reinforces ""lug"" being associated with blue and being repeated twice more after ""walm"".
  
- The last example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"", translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" confirming that ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" this color is repeated twice more, and then the pattern continues with the next words.

Based on the pattern observed in the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be:

Therefore:

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be translated into a sequence of three identical color words in the output, as follows:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue""
- ""lug walm zup"" begins with ""blue blue blue"" then is followed by the color for ""zup,"" indicating the walm pattern is indeed three blues due to the presence of ""lug.""
- ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" still produces three of the same color that precedes it.
- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" has ""walm"" translating twice into three reds each time, aligning with the color that ""wif"" corresponds to.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates into three consecutive repetitions of the color word corresponding to the color word directly preceding it.

Rule:
walm -> three repetitions of the color word that precedes it.",1.0,22,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds directly to a repeated color output, dependent on the word that comes before it. We can assess the rule for ""walm"" by looking at the color that is repeated and the word that precedes ""walm"" in each input. 

- In ""zup walm"", ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that when preceded by ""zup"", ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm"", ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that when preceded by ""lug"", ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm zup"", the presence of ""lug"" before ""walm"" again results in ""blue"" being repeated three times, followed by ""yellow"", which corresponds to ""zup"".
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""wif walm"", and ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"", we see that the pattern of repetition of a color is consistent with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".

Thus, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" results in the color associated with the word directly preceding it being repeated three times.",1.0,22,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to carefully observe the relationship between the inputs and outputs in each example:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- This example suggests that the inclusion of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three instances of the word ""yellow.""

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- Here, ""lug walm"" precedes ""zup"" and results in three instances of ""blue"" followed by one ""yellow.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- For this combination, ""dax lug walm"" generates an output of one ""green"" followed by three ""blue.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- Without any other words, ""lug walm"" leads to three instances of the word ""blue.""

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- This somewhat complex input shows ""wif walm"" followed by ""zup lug wif walm"" and another ""zup."" The corresponding output exhibits a pattern where ""wif walm"" turns into three ""red,"" ""lug"" turns into one ""blue,"" and ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" results in three consecutive color words that correspond to the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. The nonce word ""walm"" is a rule that states: replicate the color word linked with the previous word three times.

- ""wif"" is linked with ""red.""",0.9,22,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the term ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that directly follows it. Let's examine the evidence:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output is three repetitions of ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""lug walm zup"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow."" ""Lug"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output is three repetitions of ""blue,"" followed by a single instance of ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""

- In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" and ""lug"" come before ""walm,"" with the corresponding output being a single ""green"" for ""dax,"" followed by three repetitions of ""blue"" for ""lug.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" just corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output is three repetitions of ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" The pattern seems consistent here, with ""wif"" leading to three repetitions of ""red,"" then ""zup"" leading to ""yellow,"" and so on.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correlate with the color ""red"" in the output.

It is not dependent on its position in the sequence as it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or the only word in the input. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be: 

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, output ""red.""",1.0,23,wif
"Considering the given examples, I notice that each time the word ""wif"" appears, it is associated with the color ""red"". Additionally, we can try to deduce the meanings or rules for the other words based on their occurrences and their corresponding outputs.

Here are the examples provided with a word-by-word breakdown:

1. ""wif bluf"" generates ""red red"". If ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", perhaps ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"".
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" produces ""red red green green green"". We previously associated ""wif"" and ""bluf"" with ""red"", and now ""dax"" might correspond to a single ""green"" while ""walm"" might correspond to multiple ""green"" outputs.
3. ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue"". ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are already analyzed as ""red"", suggesting that ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue"".
4. ""wif"" alone results in ""red"".
5. ""wif lug walm"" gives ""red blue blue blue"". ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and we can confirm that ""walm"" seems to produce multiple ""blue"" outputs.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""bluf"" also seems to correspond to the color ""red"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- ""walm"" expands the amount of color that follows it by a factor of three.

Therefore, we can report:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,23,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The presence of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" appearing once in the output, irrespective of other words present.",1.0,23,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's first look at the patterns within the given examples:

- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf lug,"" the output is ""red red blue.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug walm,"" the output is ""red blue blue blue.""

There are a couple of patterns that can be inferred from the examples:
1. The appearance of ""wif"" always results in an output that starts with ""red.""
2. The appearance of other nonce words after ""wif"" seems to add additional colors to the output.

Thus, ""wif"" doesn't seem to have much meaning on its own but acts as a starting point or trigger for the sequence of colors in the output. The meaning of ""wif"" could then be a representation of the color ""red,"" as it consistently causes ""red"" to appear as the first color in the output, irrespective of the following words.

Based on the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" represents the color ""red"" and it might also signify the beginning of a color sequence in the output.",1.0,23,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" I'll first look at the various outputs in relation to the presence of the word ""wif"" in each input.

1. Every input example given starts with ""wif,"" and each corresponding output starts with ""red."" 
2. ""Wif"" by itself results in ""red,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds directly to ""red.""

Given these observations, the rule appears straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,23,wif
"Rule: The word ""zup"" seems to be translated as ""yellow."" This deduction comes from the direct mapping seen across all examples provided: every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,23,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Looking at the correlated color for each occurrence of ""zup"", the color ""yellow"" consistently follows it. There does not seem to be a contextual dependency for the meaning of ""zup,"" as it consistently translates to the same color irrespective of its position in the input string or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,23,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in all provided examples.",1.0,23,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,23,zup
"From the given examples, we can discern a pattern in which the word ""zup"" is substituted for:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
2. In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" but also to ""blue"" immediately after ""lug"".
3. In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again, reinforcing the first example's correlation.
4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when before ""walm lug zup"", but after ""lug zup wif dax"", it is associated with ""blue"".
5. The final example demonstrates ""zup"" as ""yellow"" consistently, with the exception again of ""lug dax"" afterward, where it signifies ""blue"".

From these examples, it appears that zup generally represents the color ""yellow"". However, there is an exception when ""zup"" is either preceded or followed by ""lug"", which in all cases apart from the initial ""lug zup lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""blue"". Since there's only one occurrence where ""zup"" is both preceded and followed by ""lug"", we might hypothesize that the rule has something to do with the position relative to ""lug"" but the given data is inconsistent in this particular case.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"", except possibly when in close proximity to ""lug"" where it may change to ""blue"". However, the rule regarding the proximity to ""lug"" is not entirely clear from the examples provided. More data would be needed to confirm this part of the rule.",0.7,23,zup
"Rule: bluf -> the color word that represents the color of the word that directly follows it in the input. If there is no word following it (i.e., ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence), its color is green as shown in the second example.",1.0,23,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the input with the output in each example:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug
   Output: blue blue green blue

5. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Analyzing the examples:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""

Now, looking at the instances where ""bluf"" appears:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" the same as ""dax,"" and it appears twice, each time followed by the color that corresponds to the following word.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" (dax) then ""red"" (wif).
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""

From this, we can deduce that the output color associated with ""bluf"" is the same as the output color associated with the word that follows ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it takes the color of the word that precedes it. 

Rule: bluf -> Takes the same color as the next word in the sequence, or if at the end, the same as the preceding word.",1.0,23,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output in each given example.

1. In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow."" So in this context, ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow.""

2. In ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds again to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" This still aligns with our previous assumption, as ""bluf"" is repeating the color prior to it.

3. In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" the first instance of ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the color output is ""green,"" which matches ""dax."" Then ""wif"" outputs ""red"" and ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" again.

4. In ""lug bluf dax lug,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and is directly followed by ""bluf,"" which also outputs ""blue."" This is consistent with previous cases.

5. In ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and so does ""bluf"" which comes right after. ""Wif"" outputs ""red"" subsequent times, and ""dax"" again ""green.""

From the examples given, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. This is evident from each instance where ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word before it, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,23,bluf
"From the examples provided, it's clear that bluf maps to a specific color. To deduce the rule for the meaning of bluf, let's match the inputs to their corresponding outputs:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
    - Here, we can see that dax corresponds to green and zup corresponds to yellow. Since bluf follows and the output is another yellow, bluf might mean yellow in this instance.

2. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
    - In this example, lug corresponds to blue and dax corresponds to green. Given that bluf comes after lug and before dax and the colors are blue green respectively, it suggests that bluf could be either blue or green. However, since it follows a blue and precedes a green, and turns out blue again, bluf might mean blue in this instance.

3. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
    - Here, dax is green, wif is red, and zup is yellow. With bluf placed after dax and the resulting color being green, it's consistent with the first example in suggesting that bluf means the color immediately preceding it.

4. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
    - In this example, lug corresponds to blue and dax to green. Bluf is surrounded by two instances of blue and maps to blue, reinforcing that bluf replicates the color immediately before it.

5. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
    - This example shows zup as yellow, wif as red, and dax as green. Bluf follows zup and maps to yellow once again, consistent with prior observations.

Rule:
Bluf -> the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",1.0,23,bluf
"From the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds directly with the color that immediately follows in the output. Here's the breakdown:

3. In the third example, the word after ""bluf"" is again ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, the word after ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
5. In the fifth example, we again see ""bluf"" followed by ""yellow.""

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times in the output.

Let's apply this rule to the given examples:

1. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times, followed by the colors for ""lug"" (blue), ""zup"" (yellow), ""wif"" (red), and ""dax"" (green).
   
2. ""lug walm"" -> ""lug"" corresponds to blue. After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.
   
3. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""dax"" corresponds to green. After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times, followed by the colors for ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue).
   
4. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""dax"" corresponds to green. After the first ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times. ""wif"" corresponds to red. After the second ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times. It ends with the color for ""zup"" (yellow).
   
5. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red. The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"", so ""red"" is repeated three times, followed by the color for ""lug"" (blue).

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to decipher the rule behind the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs and outputs to find patterns.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

From the first input and output, it is not initially clear what 'bluf' corresponds to because there are two colors associated with it: red red. However, comparing this with other examples, we see that 'bluf' could be introducing a repetition of another color in the output.

Looking at the second example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow red green"", and we see that 'bluf' is followed by a repeated color ""yellow"".

In the third example, ""zup bluf"" simply translates to ""yellow yellow"", which is a direct repetition.

The fourth and fifth examples confirm this pattern: every time 'bluf' is present, the color directly before 'bluf' is repeated in the output.

Therefore, the rule for 'bluf' is:

bluf -> meaning. The word 'bluf' means to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes 'bluf'. Rule: Repeat the previous color in the output sequence.
",1.0,24,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a particular color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow 
- lug -> blue

The word bluf yields a different output each time it appears:

- In the first example, bluf results in two reds, which do not correspond to any color attached to the words immediately preceding it (wif is red).
- In the second example, bluf produces two yellows, which again does not correspond to the color of the words next to it (wif is red).
- In the third and fourth example, bluf gives two yellows and one blue respectively, not matching the adjacent word colors.
- In the last example, bluf results in two blues, which is different from the words before it.

The color output following bluf appears to depend on the position of bluf in the string:

When bluf is:

- At the end or followed by a word that has not been assigned a specific color, it repeats the color of the last mentioned word before bluf twice.
- At the end or followed by a word that has a specific color assigned, it repeats the color of the last mentioned word before it once, followed by the color assigned to the word that follows it.

Thus, the rule for bluf seems to be:

Rule: Repeat the color of the last color-associated word before bluf, once if followed by another color-associated word, or twice if at the end or followed by a non-color-associated word.

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: See Rule above.",1.0,24,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let us look at the correlation between the input and the output across the examples:

1. In the first input, the presence of ""bluf"" corresponds to two reds in the output, and there are no other repeating colors.
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" also corresponds to a red, followed by a repeat of the color before ""bluf"", which is yellow.
3. In the third input, ""bluf"" results in a repeated yellow, and since no other color precedes it except yellow, it follows the previous pattern.
4. In the fourth input, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow and is followed by a blue, which is the color corresponding to the word ""lug"".
5. In the fifth input, ""bluf"" is again followed by a blue, the color associated with ""lug"", and there is no repetition of colors as in the previous examples.

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" is associated with a repeat of the immediately preceding color in the output (if there is one), and then it may indicate a shift to a new color that corresponds to the next word following ""bluf"". When ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it seems to repeat the color that corresponds to the word before it twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it and, if followed by another word, also results in the color corresponding to the following word.

Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" results in the following pattern:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word, and then shift to the color of the next word (if there is one).",0.8,24,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can try to understand the rule by looking for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Looking at examples 1 and 2:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

In example 3, we see a single ""zup"" maps to a single ""yellow"". Hence:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Now, let's focus on the output for ""bluf"" in different contexts:
- In example 1, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and produces two reds, but there is only one ""wif"" in the input, which might imply that ""bluf"" is repeating the color corresponding to the word before it.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and produces two yellows, fitting the above hypothesis.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again, leading to two yellows.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"", and the output is two blues, but there was no previous mention of ""lug"" to define its color. Still, it suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, whatever it may be.

By the given examples, the pattern is that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",0.8,24,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color red when it follows ""dax"" and ""wif"" but is associated with the color blue when following ""lug"" and ""zup"". Here's the breakdown:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is red (first example: ""dax... bluf"" -> ""green green green red red"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is red as well (second example: ""wif... bluf"" -> ""red... yellow red"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is yellow (third example: ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").
- When ""bluf"" follows both ""wif"" and ""zup"", the output is yellow after ""zup"" but before ""lug"" it becomes blue (fourth example: ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug"", the output is blue (fifth example: ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue"").

However, these observations are not consistent across all examples, because the third example contradicts. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by two yellow outputs, which seems to indicate that ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow"" in this specific instance.

Since the provided data is insufficient to establish a consistent pattern for ""bluf,"" we cannot assert a definitive meaning or rule. There may be additional context needed that is not included in the examples to deduce the meaning accurately.

Therefore, using the given information only, the best we can provide is this inconclusive rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" may depend on the words it immediately follows or is followed by, and no consistent rule for its meaning can be established from the provided examples.",0.25,24,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

1. In the first input-output pair:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a series of ""yellow.""

2. In the second input-output pair:
Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

After ""walm,"" the rest of the series is ""yellow.""

3. In the third input-output pair:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, ""walm"" is associated with repetitions of the color ""green"" which came right before it.

4. In the fourth input-output pair:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Once again, ""walm"" is followed by a series of the color that appeared right before it, ""blue"" in this case.

5. In the fifth input-output pair:
Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

""Walm"" is followed by repeated colors of the word before it, ""blue.""

Based on the above observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Therefore, we can define ""walm"" as:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.

So,

Walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,24,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns associated with the use of the nonce word ""walm"":

1. The word that comes before ""walm"" determines the color outputted multiple times. For every occurrence of ""walm,"" the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times.
2. The colors associated with the other words are:
   - ""zup"": yellow
   - ""wif"": red
   - ""dax"": green
   - ""lug"": blue

Now let's apply the rule to each example:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""Yellow"" is repeated three times after ""zup"", corresponding to ""walm"".

- In the second example, ""wif dax zup walm"", ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow"". Again, ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""zup"".

- In the third example, ""dax walm"", ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"". ""Green"" is repeated three times, corresponding to ""walm"" following ""dax"".

- In the fourth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"", ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". ""Blue"" is repeated three times after ""lug"".

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"", ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue red yellow red"". ""Blue"" is repeated three times following ""lug"".

Rule: walm -> the color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times. For example, if ""zup"" (yellow) is before ""walm"", the output will include ""yellow yellow yellow"".
",1.0,24,walm
"Rule: walm -> the color of the word that precedes it.

- In the first example, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" again and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" after it.
- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is three ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" the color associated with ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and the output again is multiple ""blue,"" the color for ""lug.""

So, walm -> the color of the preceding word (repeat the color of the word that comes just before it).",1.0,24,walm
"The word ""walm"" seems to cause the color word that precedes it to repeat for a number of times equal to its position in the sequence. To verify this, let's analyze the examples:

- Example 1: ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
  ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is repeated as the last color before ""walm,"" which is in the 5th position, so ""yellow"" is repeated 5 times.

- Example 2: ""wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
  ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is the last color before ""walm,"" which is in the 4th position, so ""yellow"" is repeated 4 times.

- Example 3: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""
  ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" is in the 2nd position, so ""green"" is repeated twice (one for its original position and one more time due to ""walm"").

- Example 4: ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
  ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""walm"" is in the 4th position, but it doesn't repeat ""blue"" after the sequence, which seems like an exception to the previously observed rule.

- Example 5: ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
  ""lug"" is ""blue"" and is the last color before ""walm,"" which is in the 2nd position, so ""blue"" is repeated twice (one for its original position and one more time due to ""walm"").

Upon closer inspection, Example 4 appears to contradict the initially deduced rule, with ""blue"" not repeating after ""walm."" This anomaly might point to a refinement needed in the rule or an exception, which could indicate that ""walm"" repeats the previous color word unless interrupted by another color word after ""walm.""
However, the general rule extracted from other examples would be stated as follows:

Rule:
walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat a number of times equal to its position in the list, discounting the repetition of that color after itself.",0.8,24,walm
"To induce the rule for ""walm,"" we will compare the inputs and outputs to find patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), the output is a repetition of ""yellow"" with one extra ""yellow"" at the end.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), the output is a repetition of ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), the output is a repetition of ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), ""walm"" is not directly followed in the example, but we can infer a potential pattern based on other colors.

By observing these patterns, we can induce that ""walm"" seems to replicate the color word that precedes it, sometimes with an extra instance of that color word if such a pattern permits.

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,25,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". The position of ""dax"" in the input sequence does not appear to alter its meaning, as it always results in ""green"" regardless of whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,25,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.",1.0,25,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" It appears that the color associated with ""dax"" remains consistent across the examples. Here's the breakdown:

- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" follows another word such as ""wif,"" the output following ""dax"" is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output following ""dax"" is still ""green.""
- When ""lug"" and ""zup"" are present with ""dax"" placed between them, ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" and the other words correspond to different colors (""lug"" with ""blue"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow"").

Given this evidence, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in a sequence. Hence, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green",1.0,25,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correspond directly to the color 'red'. No matter the context or combination with other words, every single occurrence of ""wif"" results in 'red' appearing in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Each instance of ""wif"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,25,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" is associated with a specific color output every time it is used. It corresponds to the color ""red."" Let's look at all the examples where ""wif"" is present and note the color output:

- ""wif zup"" maps to ""red yellow""
- ""wif"" alone maps to ""red""
- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" maps to a sequence where each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as part of a longer pattern.
- ""wif lug"" maps to ""red blue""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" maps to ""red red green green green,"" where ""wif"" is only responsible for the first ""red""

Each time ""wif"" is used in the examples, the output always includes ""red."" While the examples don't explain a precise color mapping for other words such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" or ""walm"" in relation to ""wif,"" we can focus solely on the word ""wif"" for this induction.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,25,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look for patterns associated with it in the given examples. In all instances where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Now, let’s take each input and output pair and analyze them:

1. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - We see three instances of ""wif,"" followed each time by ""red.""
   - ""walm"" seems to be repeated twice and corresponds to ""red"" both times.
   - ""zup"" corresponds again to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - ""wif"" once more corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - The sequence ""bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red green green green,"" but without more information or examples, it's hard to deduce the exact rule for ""bluf"" and ""dax."" However, since ""walm"" has corresponded to ""red"" in example 3, it may be that ""bluf"" and ""dax"" each correspond to one instance of ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that whenever we see ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,25,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" and the other nonce words.

- ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""

The examples also seem to imply that other words translate to other colors consistently as well: ""zup"" becomes ""yellow,"" ""lug"" becomes ""blue,"" ""walm"" always precedes a series of ""green,"" and ""dax"" also translates to ""green.""

Based on this pattern, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and other nonce words translate to specific colors consistently when paired with ""wif"" or on their own.

Therefore, we can write the rule as:

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""  Here's the breakdown of the evidence:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""red yellow,"" which suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" stands alone, the output is simply ""yellow.""
3. In the example ""lug walm zup walm,"" the pattern suggests that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" to a repetition of the previously mentioned color, since ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow."" In each case, ""walm"" seems to double the output of the prior word.
4. With ""zup lug wif dax lug,"" the sequence suggests that ""lug"" again translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" maintains its translation of ""yellow.""

Examples:

- Input: zup -> Output: yellow
- Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
- Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
- Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red

From these examples, we observe that every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. The presence of other words before ""zup"" (like ""dax"" and ""bluf"") seems to add their own respective colors to the sequence (e.g., ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green"").

Given the consistency of ""yellow"" always being in the output when ""zup"" appears in the input, the rule for ""zup"" seems clear. It's unlikely that there are any hidden variables not represented by these examples.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" means that the word preceding it is to be translated into a color, and then that color word is to be repeated. More specifically, ""bluf"" seems to cause the output of the color associated with the previous word to be duplicated.

For instance:
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.
- ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green"" because ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" and ""bluf"" causes the repetition.
- When no word precedes ""bluf"", or it is the first word in the sequence, there is no repeated color in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" in these examples is: 

bluf -> Repeat the color word that is associated with the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is the first word, there is no preceding word to associate with, and thus no color is repeated.",1.0,26,bluf
"bluf -> reduplicates the color word that follows it. If there is no color word following it, it defaults to reduplicating the previous color word.

Rule: When bluf is followed by a color descriptor (lug - blue, dax - green, zup - yellow, wif - red), it causes the color descriptor to be repeated. When bluf is not immediately followed by a new color descriptor, it causes the most recent color descriptor to be repeated instead.",1.0,26,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the output colors associated with its occurrence:

3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
5. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From the examples, we can make the following observations:

- In the first example, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color changes from green to green green, suggesting that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is three reds instead of the expected two, indicating that ""walm"" might be repeating the color associated with the previous word, which is red in this case.
- In the third example, again, ""walm"" seems to be repeating the red associated with ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" repeats the blue color associated with ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" repeats the color pattern associated with ""zup"" twice after ""lug zup,"" ending with yellow yellow yellow.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word one or more times depending on its position and the context of use.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated.",0.9,26,walm
"From the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" influences the color output following its appearance, and that the influence continues until a new color word is introduced or the sequence ends. Here's the breakdown:

- In all instances where ""walm"" appears, the color output following it turns into a sequence of repeated colors (e.g., ""red red red"", ""blue blue blue"").
- The sequence of colors is interrupted by a new input word that corresponds to a known color (e.g., ""dax"" introduces ""green"" and ""zup"" introduces ""yellow"").

Let's induce the rule for ""walm"":

- If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the subsequent color is red repeated the number of times corresponding to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence. For example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" led to ""red red green green green"" where ""walm"" is in the fourth position, resulting in three reds before it shifts to green.
- If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the same pattern follows with blue (""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"").
- The introduction of a new input color (like ""zup"" for yellow and ""dax"" for green) will change the color output to that new color repeated as per its position relative to the last mentioned color.

It seems that ""walm"" acts as a repeater for the last mentioned color affecting the number of times the color is repeated. The repetition starts at the position ""walm"" is at and continues until a new color is introduced or the series ends.

Rule: walm -> causes the output to repeat the last mentioned color for a count that continues from its position in the input sequence until a new color word appears, or the sequence ends.",0.9,26,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to induce the rule behind the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's what we notice:

1) Whenever ""walm"" appears directly after ""wif,"" the output is a sequence of reds. This happens regardless of what follows ""walm.""
   Example: 
   - ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in two reds followed by three greens, where the greens coincide with ""walm.""
   - ""wif walm"" itself produces three reds.
   Therefore, ""walm"" after ""wif"" seems to extend the sequence of reds by one.

2) When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is a sequence of three blues.
   Example:
   - ""lug walm"" results in blue blue blue.

3) In the absence of a preceding word, ""walm"" produces the color that would sequentially follow the color corresponding to the word before it.
   Example:
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it continues with additional yellow(s).
   - However, we have only one example of ""walm"" following ""dax"" and ""zup,"" respectively. More examples are needed for a robust induction.

Considering these points, the induced rule could be that ""walm"" means ""repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word's corresponding output color.",0.9,26,walm
"Based on the given examples, walm seems to replicate the color associated with the word that precedes it, until another color word appears or the sequence ends. 

To derive the rule: 

- ""wif"" is followed by the color ""red"", and every instance of ""walm"" after ""wif"" and before another color word is also ""red"".
- ""lug"" is followed by the color ""blue"", and ""walm"" after ""lug"" is ""blue"" until the end of the sequence or another color word.

Here is the rule breakdown for each line to illustrate:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   - ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is not a color word but seems to have no effect, ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" continues as green.

2. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
   - ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" continues as red.

3. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
   - ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" continues as red, ""dax"" changes the color to green, ""zup"" changes the color to yellow.

4. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   - ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" continues as blue.

5. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" is red, ""zup"" changes the color to yellow, ""lug"" is a non-color word with no effect, ""zup"" is still yellow, and ""walm"" continues as yellow until the end.

Based on these observations, the rule is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" replicates the color of the last color word that precedes it, until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.

Thus:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""walm"" takes the color value of the preceding color word and continues that color value until changed by another color word.",0.9,26,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm."" We know the input is a sequence of words and the output is a sequence of colors. We'll consider each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green""
   - ""walm"" adds two more ""green""

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to double ""red"" this time

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" is ""red""
   - ""walm"" is ""red"" (only one this time)
   - ""dax"" is ""green""
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow""

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" is ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to double ""blue""

5. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" is ""red""
   - ""walm"" is ""red"" here
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" is ""blue""
   - A second ""zup"" is still ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" then translates to triple ""yellow""

Looking at these examples, we can see that ""walm"" produces a variable number of the color that precedes it. It repeats the color of the word that comes just before it. The variable number of repetitions makes it somewhat challenging, but it seems that if ""walm"" follows a word that has a color associated with it once, then ""walm"" produces the color twice. If ""walm"" is the second or more repetition, it produces three occurrences of the color.

Here is a possible rule based on these observations:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence. If the previous word appears for the first time, ""walm"" doubles the color. If the previous word has appeared before, ""walm"" triples the color.",0.8,26,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" This can be seen in each instance where the word ""lug"" is used, the word ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, the rule can be written as:

- In the second example, ""wif zup wif"" translates to ""red yellow red."" The inclusion of ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" between two instances of ""wif"" leading to ""red"" suggests that ""wif"" consistently aligns with the color ""red.""

- The third and fourth examples further support that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as ""wif"" is independently translated to ""red"" regardless of its position relative to other words.

- The last example, ""dax wif dax,"" translates to ""green red green,"" showing that ""wif"" is sandwiched between two ""dax"" words, which correspond to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is consistently translated as ""red"" standing on its own.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

"Based on the given examples, we can infer that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The output colors follow the order of the input words, with each word consistently represented by the same color in the output.

The word ""zup"" is always translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words surrounding it. This leads to the conclusion that ""zup"" is directly associated with the color yellow.

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.
3. ""Bluf"" appears to simply repeat the color associated with the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,27,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns that emerge when the word appears in the examples provided.

1. From the first input ""wif dax bluf,"" we notice that the output is ""red green green."" Note that ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output.

2. In the second input ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. From the third input ""dax bluf zup,"" the output is ""green green yellow."" Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

4. For the fourth input ""dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""green red red."" In this instance, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

5. Finally, in the fifth input ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" the output is ""red green red red yellow red."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

Based on these examples, a pattern emerges where ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to a color in the output. However, that color changes depending on the words before it.

Looking more closely, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word immediately preceding it.
- When preceded by ""dax"" it becomes ""green.""
- When preceded by ""wif"" it becomes ""red.""
- In the second example, there is no direct predecessor, but if we use the pattern where ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word before it, it appears ""bluf"" will be ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word in the output.",1.0,27,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we will compare it to the output colors provided in the examples. Here's the analysis of each occurrence of the word ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" leads to the output ""green"" and follows ""dax,"" which also leads to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" produces ""blue,"" following an unknown word ""zup"" that outputs ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" again leads to ""green"" and follows ""dax"" which also outputs ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" results in ""red,"" and unlike other examples, it follows both ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), which precede it.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" again and follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red.""

The word ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the word that immediately precedes it. However, in the second example, ""bluf"" produced ""blue"" after ""zup"" produced ""yellow,"" which does not fit the pattern. Given the information from the examples, the best rule we can infer is that ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word right before it if that prior word is ""dax"" or ""wif."" Since we do not have sufficient context for what happens when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" we cannot generalize the rule to all words.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color output of the immediately preceding word if it is ""dax"" or ""wif."" When following ""zup,"" the output color does not match this rule and has resulted in ""blue"" based on the given example, although the rule for ""zup"" is not clear.",0.8,27,bluf
"Analyzing the examples given, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output. We tackle it step by step, considering the outputs given for each instance:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green, as seen in the first input example.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red, as seen in the fourth input example.
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by different words, it tends to output a color that has not been associated with preceding words.

We notice that the color output after ""bluf"" does not repeat the color output of the word that immediately precedes it. Moreover, ""bluf"" never has a unique color associated with it, instead, it changes based on its position or surrounding words.

Considering this information and looking carefully at the third input example, we see that after ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" which might seem to contradict the observation since ""green"" is repeated. However, in all other instances, ""bluf"" followed by any word other than ""dax"" results in the word after ""bluf"" having a different color output than ""bluf"" itself.

Taking into account that in the second example ""lug"" is blue when after ""bluf"" and in the first example ""dax"" is green when after ""bluf,"" it might be tempting to assign ""bluf"" an output color that corresponds to the word that follows it. But in the third example, this is contradicted since ""dax bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" which outputs yellow, not corresponding directly to ""bluf.""

Thus, based on the given information, which is insufficient to derive a perfect rule, the best hypothesis considering ""bluf"" involves it mirroring the color output of the word immediately preceding it:

Rule: bluf -> The color output following ""bluf"" repeats the color output associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""",0.8,27,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.",0.0,27,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word 'walm' seems to correspond with repeating the color assigned to the previous word. For instance, in the first example, 'dax' is green and after 'walm' is mentioned, green is repeated. The pattern continues in all the other examples presented.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.",1.0,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine how it is represented in the output across various contexts:

1. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
4. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green

From these examples, we can identify the following patterns:

- Every time the word ""walm"" is included, the output has a sequence of yellows equivalent to the number of occurrences of ""walm"" plus the number of occurrences of ""zup"" that are immediately before ""walm"".
- ""walm"" by itself does not correspond to a color that appears without a preceding ""zup"". It is only when ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" that the output shows a sequence of yellow.
- No other word in the input seems to affect the output in relation to ""walm"".

Based on these patterns, we can conclude the following rule: The nonce word ""walm"" results in a consecutive sequence of yellows in the output. The number of yellows is equal to the count of ""walm"" plus the count of any ""zup"" that immediately precedes a ""walm"".

Rule: Walm -> For each occurrence of ""walm,"" output a sequence of yellow. The number of yellow is one plus the number of ""zup"" immediately before it.",1.0,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the output sequence corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

In all given examples, every occurrence of ""walm"" equals a sequence of ""yellow"" outputs. The number of consecutive ""yellow"" outputs seems to correspond to the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence considering the preceding words. Specifically, it appears that for each word preceding ""walm,"" one ""yellow"" is added to the output sequence.

Let's examine this observation:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by three words, and the output is three ""yellow""s followed by another color.
- In the second example, there are two words before ""walm,"" and the output is two ""yellow""s.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows four words, hence there are four ""yellow""s.
- The fourth example has ""walm"" twice, first preceded by one word and then by four words; the outputs are accordingly one and four ""yellow""s.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows three words and the output is three ""yellow""s.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> For each word preceding ""walm"" in an input sequence, output one ""yellow"" in the corresponding position of the output sequence.",1.0,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let us examine the given inputs and their corresponding outputs carefully:

- When the input has one ""walm,"" the output contains one more yellow than green and blue colors that appear before ""walm."" If there are no green/blues or an equal number of greens and blues, we add another yellow regardless.
- When the input has two occurrences of ""walm,"" there are always two more yellows than the number of greens and blues appearing before each respective ""walm.""
- When we have an input with multiple ""walm"" occurrences, the pattern persists, increasing the number of yellows in the output related to the number of ""walm"" instances.

Based on these observations, we can derive a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: For each occurrence, ""walm"" translates to a number of yellows in the output that equate to one more than the number of green and blue colors that appear before it in the input. If there are no greens or blues, or an equal number of green and blues before ""walm,"" then it defaults to one yellow.

Thus:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Each occurrence of ""walm"" results in one yellow plus one additional yellow for every blue or green occurring before it in sequence in the input.",0.8,27,walm
"Based on the outputs provided for each given input, we see that the word ""walm"" is causing the output to be a series of ""yellow"". However, the number of times ""yellow"" appears seems to be dependent on the number of words that precede ""walm"". Here is the breakdown of how ""walm"" affects the output:

1. zup walm dax lug -> 1 word before walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
2. zup wif walm -> 2 words before walm -> Output: yellow red red red
3. lug wif dax zup walm -> 4 words before walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
4. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> 1 word before walm in the first instance, 3 words before the second instance of walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. dax zup dax walm -> 3 words before walm -> Output: green yellow green green green

It seems like ""walm"" results in a sequence of ""yellow""s that matches the number of words preceding it. Notably, if there are two instances of ""walm"", the rule applies independently for each occurrence.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repetition of the word ""yellow"" in the output. The number of ""yellow""s that follow ""walm"" equals the number of words that appear before ""walm"" in the input sequence.",0.8,27,walm

Rule: In each example, the word 'dax' consistently translates to the color green.",1.0,28,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the Output sequences.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,28,dax
"Based on the given examples, dax is consistently associated with the color green. When the word dax appears in the input, the color green appears in the corresponding output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,28,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the series of words. Each other word in the input seems to correspond to a unique color as well, with ""zup"" mapping to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow."" 

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,28,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we are to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Let's analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

```
Input: zup lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow blue yellow red green
```
In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

```
Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red
```
Here, ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

```
Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
```
Once again, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

```
Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
```
The same as the previous example.

```
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
```
Within this string, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" ""Walm"" presents an irregularity in the pattern, as it is not present in the input but the output repeats ""yellow"" thrice, which may indicate a pattern of repetition tied to ""walm"" rather than ""dax.""

By examining the consistent relationship across the examples, the meaning of ""dax"" is clear. 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,28,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,28,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" We can observe that in every output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input, the output always includes ""red."" The other words correspond to specific colors, but the presence of ""wif"" does not alter the translation of these other words. Therefore:

wif -> meaning. Rule: wif translates to the color red.",1.0,28,wif
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" This conclusion is made from the consistent appearance of the word ""red"" in the output whenever ""wif"" is present in the input.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,28,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Thus, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,28,zup
zup -> yellow,1.0,28,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,28,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,28,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Given these correspondences, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,28,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red. Every time ""bluf"" is used, the output is red. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red.",1.0,28,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when following or preceding certain words, except in the case where it follows the word ""lug,"" in which case ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" This suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent. Let's examine each case:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is blue.
- In all other cases, when ""bluf"" is present, the output color is red.

The rule can be written as:

bluf -> If the previous word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" means blue. In all other contexts, ""bluf"" means red.",1.0,28,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the same position. Following this pattern, the rule is:

bluf -> red.",1.0,28,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following: 

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" seems to replicate the prior color, based on the third example ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"".

Now, looking specifically at ""bluf"", we see that each time it appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. More importantly, ""bluf"" does not result in ""red"" when it is the last word in the sequence. Instead, ""red"" is duplicated just before the ""bluf"" position, and then ""bluf"" translates to a different color depending on the word that follows it. Let's analyze:

- In the first example, ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and results in ""green"" because the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which translates to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the first ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""green,"" and the second ""bluf"" is preceded by the color ""red"" twice and followed by ""wif,"" resulting in ""green.""

It seems that ""bluf"" may represent a rule that predicts the next color in sequence, but it requires the next word after ""bluf"" to determine its output. Here is the pattern noticed:

- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it turns into ""green,"" mimicking the color of ""dax"" if ""dax"" is mentioned anywhere before ""bluf"" in the sequence.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it turns into ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it repeats the last color mentioned before it (the fifth example, ""wif bluf zup,"" ends with ""bluf zup,"" resulting in ""red yellow,"" with red being the repetition of the previous color).

Based on this pattern, a proposed rule for ""bluf"" could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to repeat, and the resulting color is determined by the word following ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it results in ""blue"". If ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it results in ""green"" if a ""dax"" is present before ""bluf"" in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is at the end, it repeats the last color mentioned before it.

Thus, we can write:

bluf -> Repeats the preceding color word, with the resulting color influenced by the word that follows ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is at the end, it repeats the last color mentioned before it.",0.9,28,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,28,bluf
"From the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the preceding nonce word. Therefore, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the last color encountered before it appears. Here's the rule based on each example:

- lug walm -> lug corresponds to blue, and walm repeats it three times.
- zup dax walm zup wif -> zup corresponds to yellow, dax corresponds to green, and walm repeats the last color (green) three times, followed by a yellow from zup and a red from wif.
- zup bluf wif walm -> zup corresponds to yellow, bluf is also yellow, wif corresponds to red, and walm repeats the last color (red) three times.
- lug walm zup lug zup wif -> lug corresponds to blue, walm repeats it twice, followed by a yellow from zup, another blue from lug, and ends with a yellow from zup and a red from wif.
- dax lug walm -> dax corresponds to green, lug corresponds to blue, and walm repeats the last color (blue) three times.

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the last mentioned color multiple times. The number of repetitions can vary based on some unspecified rule, but it is always a repeat of the last color mentioned before the word ""walm"".",1.0,28,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for the pattern of translation across the examples:

1. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
2. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
3. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
4. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Now, looking at the outputs, we see that each time ""walm"" appears, a sequence of a color repeats. Observing, we'll find:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"", which suggests ""walm"" means repeat the color ""blue"" twice more (total of three times).
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"", here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
3. In all other examples, ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated a total of three times.

Hence, the pattern suggests that ""walm"" indicates the preceding color word is to be outputted three times in total.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word two additional times (for a total of three times).",1.0,28,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeating the color associated with the preceding word. 

Based on the examples, the word ""walm"" repeats the color mapped to the word immediately before it, a number of times equal to the number mentioned in the preceding word. Since none of the examples depict a numeric value, it's assumed to repeat three times by default as the smallest set of examples repeat the color three times.

- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" maps to blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.
- In ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and maps to green, thus ""walm"" repeats the color green three times.
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" maps to red and precedes ""walm,"" leading ""walm"" to repeat the color red three times.
- In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" ""lug"" maps to blue and precedes the first ""walm,"" and thus ""walm"" repeats blue three times. 
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" maps to blue and precedes ""walm,"" prompting ""walm"" to repeat blue three times.",1.0,28,walm
"Rule:
- walm -> the color word that precedes it, repeated three times.

For example:
- In ""lug walm"", lug corresponds to blue, so walm means ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""dax lug walm"", dax corresponds to green and lug to blue. Since lug is the closest to walm, walm means ""blue blue blue"".",1.0,28,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to repeating the previous color word multiple times. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of syllables in the previous color word (e.g., ""lug"" has one syllable, leading to one repetition of ""blue""; ""dax"" has one syllable, leading to one repetition of ""green""; ""zup"" has one syllable, leading to one repetition of ""yellow""). 

Therefore, walm -> repeating the previous color word the number of times equal to the syllables in that word.",0.0,28,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,29,lug
"Based on the provided examples, each time the nonce word ""lug"" appears, it is consistently translated to ""blue"" in the output. There is no variation in this translation, which suggests that the meaning is not context-dependent. Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,29,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence or the surrounding words, the output for ""lug"" remains ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,29,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can induce that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. Meanwhile, other words seem to correspond to different colors, with ""zup"" potentially corresponding to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,29,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

In each output, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the surrounding words, the presence of ""dax"" results in ""green"" in the output sequence. Hence, the general rule we can deduce is that the word ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,29,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples and outputs systematically:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears alone as an input, the output is simply ""green.""
- Whenever ""dax"" appears alongside other nonce words, every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output sequence. This indicates that ""dax"" likely translates to ""green"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Next, we need to observe if the other nonce words have consistent corresponding output colors:

- For ""zup,"" it consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" when it appears in the input.
- For ""bluf,"" it consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output when it follows ""dax,"" but we need to be cautious because we don't have enough diverse examples to confirm if ""bluf"" means ""green"" independently or only in conjunction with ""dax.""
- For ""lug"" and ""wif,"" they consistently correspond to ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively, in all the examples given.

Based on these observations, we conclude that:

Rule: ""dax"" consistently means ""green."" 

Other words seem to have their translations as well. ""Zup"" likely translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" However, we cannot confidently determine a sole meaning for ""bluf"" due to the lack of variety in the examples. It is associated with ""green"" but only in sequences that also contain ""dax."" 

Additional examples without the word ""dax"" would help to further clarify the meaning of ""bluf"" and confirm the meanings of the other nonce words.",1.0,29,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,29,dax
"Based on the series of input and output examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax"" as it relates to the output colors.

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" is included in the output at least once.
- The word following ""dax"" in the input sequence affects the color that follows the ""green"" in the output which is produced by ""dax"".
- For other words in the input (not followed by ""dax""), each seems to correspond to a particular color in the output:
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""bluf"" immediately following ""dax"" results in an additional ""green""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Hence, the most straightforward rule we can determine is:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" in the input, it results in an additional ""green"" in the output.",0.9,29,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

Rule: wif -> red,1.0,29,wif
Rule: The nonce word 'wif' translates to the color 'red'.,1.0,29,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at how it appears relative to other words and the resulting pattern in the outputs:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is included in the output.
2. ""wif"" appears at the beginning of every input, and ""red"" is the first color in every output.
3. ""wif"" also appears in other positions besides the start (see examples 2 and 3), and every time it does, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the list of words. We can also deduct the meanings of other words based on their consistent pairing with specific colors in the output:

- ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green.""
- ""lug"" when it appears, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Given these observations, the rule appears to be:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' represents the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,29,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

- In a single-word context, when ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" appears in combination with another nonce word (like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""wif""), it seems to be a placeholder for the color ""yellow,"" while the accompanying nonce word specifies an additional color.

However, it is unclear how the accompanying nonce word is specifically translated into the other colors like ""blue,"" ""green,"" or ""red."" There might be a rule for these translations as well, but there is insufficient data to determine that rule.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". When ""zup"" appears alone or in sequence with other words, it consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,29,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that the word before ""bluf"" translates to. Here are the specific observations that support this rule:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". ""Wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" follows the same color.
2. In the second example, ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green"". ""Dax"" translates to ""green"", and similarly, ""bluf"" follows by also being ""green"".
3. In the third example, again ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" takes on that same color.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" is ""green green"", aligning with the prior observations.
5. In the fifth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", which is consistent with the pattern where ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it (""lug"" translates to ""blue"").

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".",1.0,29,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it. This is evident because whenever ""bluf"" appears after a word, the output color for ""bluf"" matches the output color of the word before it.

For instance:
- In the first example ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".
- In the second example ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".
- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"".

Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> The color of the preceding word.",1.0,29,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must identify the pattern in which it is used across the different inputs and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

From these examples, we can observe that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that is immediately before it. 

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Bluf means to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,29,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the color patterns associated with each word across the examples:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it comes after ""wif"" or precedes ""bluf.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it appears alone or follows ""wif.""

To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" it's helpful to look for the patterns in the outputs immediately following it:

- Example 1: ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
- Example 2: ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
- Example 3: ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""
- Example 4: ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
- Example 5: ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""

Based on these observations, the common pattern is that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color that comes before it. If a word ""X"" corresponds to a color ""Y,"" then ""X bluf"" corresponds to ""Y Y.""

"Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. If no word follows, bluf defaults to green.",0.8,29,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of a color three times. The color repeated appears to be dependent on the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". Here are the associations:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""

When ""zup"" is before ""walm"", the result is three repetitions of ""yellow"".
When ""lug"" is before ""walm"", the result is three repetitions of ""blue"".
When ""dax"" is before ""walm"", the result is three repetitions of ""green"".
When ""wif"" is before ""walm"", the result is three repetitions of ""red"".

Furthermore, when ""walm"" appears twice as in the example ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the pattern of color repetition applies for each instance separately. ""Wif walm"" generates ""red red red"", and ""zup walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow"".

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" three times. Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Therefore, ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug"" gives ""green green green yellow blue"". This suggests ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats the color ""green"" three times.
- The third example, ""lug walm"", translates to ""blue blue blue"". This supports the rule, as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats it three times. After ""zup walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times, supporting the rule that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated.

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" produces another red.
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, hence ""bluf"" also produces green.
- For ""wif dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" gives yellow, followed by ""bluf,"" which gives another yellow.
- ""zup bluf wif"" has ""zup"" giving yellow and ""bluf"" duplicating that yellow before ""wif"" gives red.
- And lastly, ""wif bluf dax walm"" shows that ""bluf"" duplicates ""wif"" as red, then ""dax"" results in green followed by ""walm,"" which adds another green.

From these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word prior to it.",1.0,30,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""bluf,"" we should look at how its appearance changes the output in each example.

- In the first input, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" suggesting that bluf might be a repetition of the color associated with the word right before it, which in this case is ""red"" for ""wif"".
- In the second input, ""zup dax bluf"" becomes ""yellow green green,"" again hinting that bluf causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word right before it, which is ""green"" for ""dax"".
- Following the same pattern, the third and fourth examples reinforce this observation.
- The fifth input includes a new word, ""walm,"" but based on previous patterns, we can assume that bluf is still causing the repetition of the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word.",1.0,30,bluf
"From the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" refers to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"". Here's the reasoning:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" where ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green"" where ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"" where ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red"" where ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" repeats it before reaching ""wif"" which is associated with ""red"".
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"" where ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", ""bluf"" repeats it, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", and ""walm"" presumably creates one more repetition of the color associated with ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule is: 

Rule: bluf -> the word bluf duplicates the color that the word immediately preceding it represents.",1.0,30,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by observing the patterns before and after its use. Here's what we can notice from the input-output pairs:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated once.
2. The appearance of ""bluf"" doesn't change the pattern of colors that come after it.

Let's apply this to the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" gives two reds - which indicates ""bluf"" causes the color of ""wif"" (red) to repeat.
- In the second example, ""zup dax bluf"" outputs ""yellow green green"" - after ""dax"" comes ""bluf,"" resulting in repeated green.
- The third example follows the same rule as ""wif dax zup bluf"" results in ""red green yellow yellow,"" with ""yellow"" repeating after ""bluf.""
- The fourth example, ""zup bluf wif,"" further confirms this as the occurrence of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in a repeated yellow before the sequence continues with the next color (red for ""wif"").
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" we see that after ""bluf,"" not only is the color of ""dax"" (green) repeated, but there's also an extra green following ""walm,"" which seems to follow the same rule of the word preceding it.

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output.

So we can say:
bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,30,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here is how the rule applies to the examples:

1. wif bluf: ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""bluf"" which duplicates the color of ""wif"", leading to red red.
   
2. zup dax bluf: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, followed by ""bluf"" which duplicates the color of ""dax"", leading to yellow green green.
  
3. wif dax zup bluf: ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""bluf"" which duplicates the color of ""zup"", leading to red green yellow yellow.
   
4. zup bluf wif: ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""bluf"" which duplicates the color of ""zup"", leading to yellow yellow, and then ""wif"" is red.
   
5. wif bluf dax walm: ""wif"" is red, followed by ""bluf"" which duplicates the color of ""wif"", leading to red red, ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" does not have a corresponding color but the pattern suggests that each subsequent color, if none is specified, is a repetition of the last explicitly mentioned color, leading to green green green.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,30,bluf
"Observing the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to result in the same color being repeated three additional times. Here are the associations:

- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, then ""walm"" causes the color red to appear three more times.
- In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, then ""walm"" makes green repeat three times before moving onto ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In ""dax walm wif dax,"" ""dax"" is green and is followed by three more greens because of ""walm,"" then the sequence continues as usual.
- In ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, so ""walm"" results in three more yellows.
- In ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" leads to three additional blues; then ""zup"" introduces yellow, and the subsequent ""walm"" leads to three more yellows.

Accordingly, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three additional times.",1.0,30,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule:

Analyzing the output colors for 'walm' relative to the surrounding words and their output gives us the following insights:

- In every instance where 'walm' appears, the output is a sequence of the same color repeated.
- The color that is repeated depends on the word that directly precedes 'walm':
  - If 'walm' is preceded by 'zup,' the output color is yellow.
  - If 'walm' is preceded by 'lug,' the output color is blue.
  - If 'walm' is preceded by 'dax,' the output color is green.
  - 'wif' precedes 'walm' in multiple instances, but the color following 'wif' changes depending on the word before 'wif.' Therefore, 'wif' does not seem to determine the color associated with 'walm' directly.

Given this information, we can deduce a rule about the meaning of 'walm': 'walm' causes the output to be multiple instances of a particular color, and that color is determined by the word immediately preceding 'walm.'

Rule: The nonce word 'walm' means to repeat the output color associated with the word directly preceding it.",1.0,30,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning appears to be the repetition of the color immediately preceding ""walm"" for a count equivalent to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence. Rule:

- If ""walm"" is the second word, the first word's color is repeated once.
- If ""walm"" is the third word, the second word's color is repeated twice.
- If ""walm"" is the fourth word, the third word's color is repeated three times, and so on.

In each case, ""walm"" takes the color of the word right before it and repeats that color as many times as its position in the sequence:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red"" followed by ""walm"", which is the third word, so ""red"" is repeated thrice -> Output: ""yellow red red red"".
2. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green"" followed by ""walm"", which is the fourth word, so ""green"" is repeated thrice -> Output: ""yellow red green green green blue"".
3. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green"" followed by ""walm"", which is the second word, so ""green"" is repeated once -> Output: ""green green red green"".
4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow"" followed by ""walm"", which is the fifth word, so ""yellow"" is repeated four times -> Output: ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"".
5. ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue"" followed by ""walm"", which is the second word, so ""blue"" is repeated once, then ""zup"" adds ""yellow"", followed by another ""walm"" which is now the fifth word, so ""yellow"" is repeated four times -> Output: ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"".",1.0,30,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""walm"". Let's analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

3. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

If we look at the positions where ""walm"" occurs and the color it correlates to, it seems like ""walm"" is associated with a repeating color pattern based on the word that precedes it:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" causes the repetition of red.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"", with ""dax"" corresponding to green and ""walm"" leading to its repetition.
- In the third example, ""walm wif"" has the effect of ""green red"", with ""walm"" preceding ""wif"" and causing green, the color associated with the previous word ""dax"", to repeat before ""wif"" changes the color to red.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" also leads to the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

Considering the patterns observed in the examples, ""walm"" seems to be causing the preceding color to repeat itself three times. Since ""walm"" is used differently in the third example, it might imply that the repetition rule applies both when ""walm"" follows and when it precedes another word, with priority given to the repeating rule even over the next word that would otherwise change the color.

Based on the above analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times, regardless of the position of ""walm"" (before or after another color indicative word).

So:

walm -> causes repetition of the previous color three times",0.8,30,walm
"To deduce the meaning of walm, let's look at the given examples and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   We see walm corresponds to three reds.

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   We see walm yields three greens followed by a blue.

3. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   Here, walm results in three greens.

4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, walm results in three yellows.

5. Input: lug walm zup walm

Based on the given examples, we can see a consistent pattern where walm appears to represent three of the color that precedes it. In examples 1, 3, 4, and 5, walm is preceded by one color, and the output is three of that color. In example 2, walm is at the end, followed by lug, which gives a different single color instead.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns within the examples provided that are consistent whenever the word ""dax"" is used.

4. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red""
5. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""

From these examples, we can infer the following patterns:

- In every instance, the occurrence of the word ""dax"" correlates to the word ""green"" in the output.
- There is no immediate pattern in the surrounding words that alters the output for ""dax,"" suggesting that ""dax"" itself directly translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the context.
- Other words like ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" have outputs that vary in color, while ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems clear:

In this context, all other words in the input translate to a color in the output, but their translation is not based on the word alone but also on its position or sequence in the input (for example, ""lug"" can correspond to ""blue"" or ""yellow"" depending on its position).

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

- ""wif"" is associated with the word ""red,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""red red red.""",1.0,31,walm
"Rule: lug -> blue

Each example shows that whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Hence, it can be deduced that ""lug"" means ""blue.""",1.0,32,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,32,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue, irrespective of its position in the sequence.",1.0,32,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.",1.0,32,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,32,lug
"From the examples provided, it seems that each unique word translates to a specific color. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" and the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each example where it appears. The second example demonstrates the repetition of ""green"" with the word ""walm,"" which seems to indicate repeating the color of the word that comes before it. Since ""dax"" appears before ""walm,"" it is followed by repeated ""green"" outputs.

Given this consistent one-to-one correspondence between ""dax"" and ""green,"" we can deduce the rule.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,32,dax
"Observing the examples where the nonce word ""dax"" is used and the corresponding outputs, it's possible to deduce a pattern:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" appears between ""lug"" and ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green green green"" (which is a repetition of the color ""green"" three times).
3. The third example is identical to the first, providing the same output and reinforcing the connection between ""lug dax wif"" and ""blue green red.""
4. The fourth example has ""zup dax walm,"" which translates to ""yellow green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" before ""walm"" still leads to repeated ""green.""
5. The fifth example includes ""zup dax wif,"" translating to ""yellow green red,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, we can infer the following rule for the nonce word ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" means ""green."" When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" it causes the word ""green"" to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

dax -> green (with specific behavior when followed by the word ""walm"")",1.0,32,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following correspondences:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Now, we need to figure out what ""dax"" corresponds to:

1. In the first and third examples:
   - ""lug dax wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue green red blue""
   - We can see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Given this, ""dax"" in this context is the word that corresponds to ""green"".

2. In the second example:
   - ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
   - Here, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color, reinforcing that ""dax"" correlates with ""green"".

3. In the fourth example:
   - ""lug zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green green green""
   - Given that ""lug"" = ""blue"", ""zup"" = ""yellow"", and the repetition of green that follows ""dax"", ""dax"" likely still corresponds to ""green"".

4. In the fifth example:
   - ""zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green red""
   - ""zup"" = ""yellow"" and ""wif"" = ""red"", indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as it does in the other examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,32,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,32,dax
"From the examples provided, we can try to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at the patterns of input and output. We will begin by analyzing each example:

1. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green

5. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red

Firstly, we notice that each time ""lug"" appears in the input it corresponds with ""blue"" in the output. Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

Secondly, it's clear that ""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" as it consistently appears each time ""dax"" is in the input. What's interesting is that ""dax"" seems to affect following words in some cases, as we see in example 2 and 4. In example 2, ""dax walm"" gives us ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" may repeat the color that follows it. However, this does not hold in example 4, as ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green"" and not ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" after ""dax"" gives us triple ""green.""

Hence, the first rule we can deduce is that ""dax"" means ""green."" The second observation is that ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""green"" three times, which seems to be a specific case rather than a general rule applying to every word that follows ""dax.""

So, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" ""dax"" causes the output to be ""green"" repeated three times.",1.0,32,dax
"Based on the given examples, the rule for determining the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be consistent regardless of its position in the input sequence. Looking at the outputs, every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". 

So, wif -> red.",1.0,32,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the patterns present in the colors that correspond to each word in the given inputs and outputs.

From the first input and output, we notice that wif is followed by walm zup, and each time this sequence occurs, it translates to red red red yellow. However, the fourth red is not directly associated with a word in the input; it is probably a repeat of the color red for the word ""wif.""

Comparing the first and second outputs, it seems that ""lug"" translates to blue since that's one thing that doesn't change.

By looking at different instances where wif appears and noting the corresponding output color, we can infer that wif seems to always correspond to the color red.

- In the first input, ""wif"" appeared twice and each time it was followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the second input, ""wif"" appeared once at the end and was followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the third input, ""wif"" appeared at the end after ""lug"" and was again followed by ""red.""
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" appeared at the start and was followed by ""red.""
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" appeared second and was followed by ""red.""

With this pattern, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,32,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can notice that the word ""wif"" is associated with a specific color output 'red' every time it appears. It does not seem to matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence; its presence always yields 'red'.

Thus, with the given data:

wif -> meaning. Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,32,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" in the output. It does not seem to depend on position or surrounding words, as ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its place in the input sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule for what ""wif"" means can be defined as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,32,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to correspond to a specific color. Now, let's attempt to deduce the rule for the meaning of ""wif.""

- When ""wif"" appears at the start, it translates to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears after ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" it still translates to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears between other colors, it also translates to ""red.""

Regardless of its position in the series of words, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,32,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,32,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,32,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,32,zup
"From the provided examples, we can see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,32,zup
"Observing the patterns associated with the placement of ""zup"" and its corresponding outputs, it becomes clear that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There's no context-dependent variability in the meaning of ""zup""; it maintains this meaning throughout all examples provided.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,32,zup
"From the given examples, we can try to deduce the pattern by matching the provided inputs with their respective outputs. Let's analyze each case:

1. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue

Based on the examples, bluf appears to replicate the color of the word immediately preceding it:
- In the first example, bluf follows dax, which corresponds to green, so bluf also becomes green.
- In the second example, bluf follows wif, which corresponds to red, so bluf becomes red.
- In the third example, bluf again follows zup, which corresponds to yellow, making bluf yellow.
- In the fourth example, it's directly after lug, which is blue, so bluf is blue.
- In the last example, bluf follows lug (blue) and later in the sequence, there's no bluf, but we can confirm the pattern since the rest of the output aligns with the previous rules deduced for lug, wif, and walm.

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is to take on the color of the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" follows a word that corresponds to ""blue"", then ""bluf"" means ""blue""; if it follows a word that corresponds to ""red"", then ""bluf"" means ""red""; and so on.",1.0,32,bluf

- The word ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to red.

With this information, we can observe the outputs for ""bluf"" across different examples and look for a pattern. Since ""bluf"" seems to match with different colors depending on the context, let's look closely.

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" it outputs green, which is the same as the color for ""dax"".
2. When ""bluf"" is next to ""lug"" it outputs blue, which is the same as the color for ""lug"".
3. When ""bluf"" is next to ""wif"", it outputs red, which is the same as the color for ""wif"".

By observing these patterns, we conclude that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. If there's no word before it, then the pattern is incomplete based on the given data, as there is no instance where ""bluf"" starts the sequence.",1.0,32,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided examples:

1. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue

Looking at the colors that follow ""bluf"" in the sequences, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. The rules seem consistent across all examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to green.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue.

Rule: bluf -> blue.,0.0,33,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns and correspondences in each of the given examples:

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: zup bluf wif walm

Looking at the input and output sequences, we can deduce that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. From these examples, we can extract the following correspondences:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

When the nonce word ""walm"" is used, we notice that the color after the word corresponds to the color of the word before ""walm."" For example:

- In the first input, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Following ""walm"" is ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue."" Hence the output around ""walm"" is ""red blue.""
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is followed by no other words, so the color after ""walm"" is red, repeating the color of ""wif.""
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is again followed by no other words, repeating the red color.
- In the fourth input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" so blue is the color before and after ""walm.""
- The fifth input is the same as the third and results in the same pattern of colors.

From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""walm"" to repeat once immediately after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the sequence, repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word in the output sequence.",1.0,33,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by examining the patterns of colors associated with the words before and after ""walm.""

First, let's define the colors we know from the other words:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> green (on the first example) but also appears to be yellow in another context
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
  
To figure out what ""walm"" means, we should look at what changes when ""walm"" is introduced in a series of words:
  
1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

In this sequence, the word ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and is followed by ""lug,"" and the colors before and after ""walm"" are red and blue, respectively. 

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the next word is not present; hence the default color red follows, which is the color for ""wif.""

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

""Walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and yellow and reds are before and after ""walm.""

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the next color is blue again.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm (Same as the third example)
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

The pattern is consistent with the other examples.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" does not have its own color but instead, it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it takes the color of the previous word in the list.

Hence, we can establish the rule as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""",1.0,33,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each example.

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

By analyzing the data, we see that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears once more in the output than it does for the corresponding word before ""walm"". For example, in the first input, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" there is an extra ""red."" Similarly, in the fourth input, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" there is an extra ""blue.""

Thus, the rule seems to be:

walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word an additional time.

Rule: Repeat the output color of the word before ""walm"" one more time.",1.0,33,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"". We need to look at the surrounding words and their corresponding output colors to understand how ""walm"" affects the sequence.

1. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   red red green green red red red blue red

2. dax wif walm
   green red red red

3. zup bluf wif walm
   yellow yellow red red red

4. lug walm
   blue blue blue

5. zup bluf wif walm (repeated example)
   yellow yellow red red red

Here are a few observations:

- In every example where ""walm"" appears, the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated in the output as one more instance of its corresponding color. For instance, the color that corresponds to ""lug"" is blue, and in the sequence ""lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""lug"" has been repeated once more in the output.
- There is no example given with ""walm"" at the beginning or end of the sequence, so we don't have information about how ""walm"" would affect the pattern in those positions.

So, the rule associated with ""walm"" based on the given examples seems to be that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.

2. In the second example, ""wif"" is red. After ""walm,"" there are three consecutive ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""wif"" is red, and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated.

4. In the fourth example, the sequence starts with ""lug,"" which is blue. After ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice.

Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.,1.0,34,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" outputs the color associated with the preceding word twice.

- wif bluf -> red red (Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red.)

- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red (Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" to red.)
- dax bluf -> green green (Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green.)

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf duplicates the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,34,bluf
"Based on the examples given, we observe the following patterns:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, the word ""walm"" follows specific words (""wif"", ""lug"", and ""dax"") and causes the next word to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
- In example 2, the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", then followed by ""green,"" indicating ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Let's consider each input and output to derive the meaning:

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue,"" showcasing that ""walm"" causes the color ""red,"" associated with ""wif,"" to repeat until a new word (""lug"") with a different associated color (""blue"") appears.
   
2. ""lug walm dax"" gives ""blue blue blue green,"" so after ""lug,"" which is associated with ""blue,"" ""walm"" again causes the color to repeat until ""dax"" changes it to green.

3. ""zup walm wif"" has the output ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word ""zup"" (""yellow"") to repeat until a new color (""red"") is introduced with ""wif.""

4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" illustrating that ""walm"" causes repetition of ""blue"" from ""lug"" until ""zup"" introduces a new color (""yellow""), which is then followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""
   
5. ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue,"" further confirming that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes right before it, which in this case is ""blue"" from ""lug.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat until a new word with a different associated color appears. 

Thus, the meaning can be stated as:

walm -> Causes the repetition of the previous word's associated color.",1.0,34,walm
"To understand the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs related to its presence in the input sequence:

1. (zup wif walm lug) -> (yellow red red red blue)
2. (lug walm dax) -> (blue blue blue green)
3. (zup walm wif) -> (yellow yellow yellow red)
4. (dax lug walm zup wif) -> (green blue blue blue yellow red)
5. (dax lug walm) -> (green blue blue blue)

In each case where ""walm"" is used, the output colors after walm are repetitions of the color before ""walm,"" until another color word is encountered or the sequence ends.

Let's detail the observations:

1. In Example 1, when ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" we get ""red red red"" until we encounter ""lug,"" which changes the output to ""blue.""
2. In Example 2, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""blue blue blue"" until ""dax,"" changing the output to ""green.""
3. In Example 3, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow"" until ""wif"" changes the output color to ""red.""
4. In Example 4, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue blue"" until ""zup,"" which changes the output to ""yellow,"" and then ""wif,"" which changes it to ""red.""
5. In Example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"" because there are no more color words after ""walm.""

This leads to the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the previous color in the sequence to repeat until a new color word is encountered or the sequence ends.",1.0,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns between the inputs and outputs. We notice that sequences that include ""walm"" result in a repetition of a color in the output. We should look at which color repeats and what precedes ""walm"" in each sequence to find the rule.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
In this case, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and ""red"" is repeated three times in the output.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again, ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
And once more, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Based on the pattern, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" should be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> The color word before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.",1.0,34,walm
"Based on the examples given, the word 'walm' seems to change the output color to mimic the color just before it for all subsequent words until the pattern is changed by a new word. Here's the breakdown of the pattern:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif walm lug,"" 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and 'wif' corresponds to red. After 'walm,' 'lug' also corresponds to red, implying 'walm' caused 'lug' to change to the color of 'wif.'

2. In the second example, ""lug walm dax,"" 'lug' corresponds to blue. After 'walm,' 'dax' also corresponds to blue, indicating 'walm' caused 'dax' to change to the color of 'lug.'

3. In the third example, ""zup walm wif,"" 'zup' corresponds to yellow. After 'walm,' 'wif' also corresponds to yellow, following the established pattern that 'walm' causes subsequent words to change to the color of the word right before 'walm.'

4. In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" we see 'dax' corresponds to green, 'lug' to blue, and then 'zup' to blue as well after 'walm,' continuing on with 'wif' matching 'zup' at red.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm,"" 'dax' corresponds to green and 'lug' to blue. After 'walm,' there are no more words, but if there were, we could expect them to also be blue.

walm -> rule. Rule: When 'walm' appears in a sequence, the color output of every word after 'walm' matches the color output of the word immediately preceding 'walm'.",0.8,34,walm
"Based on the examples provided where the word ""walm"" is used, we observe the following:

- When ""walm"" appears once in a sequence with other non-repeating words, the color sequence includes one additional red compared to the sequence of the other words. This is evident in the first example, where ""walm"" increases the count of red by one.
- When ""walm"" appears in a sequence with repeating words, the repeated words are all translated into the same color until a different word or ""walm"" itself disrupts this sequence. This is apparent in an example like ""lug walm dax"" where ""lug"" before ""walm"" is translated into blue, and after ""walm,"" the next ""lug"" is also blue.

From the examples provided, we can infer a rule for what ""walm"" means:

Rule: ""walm"" -> a signal to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it until a different word appears. If there is no preceding word (as in the first word of a sequence), or if the preceding word is unique in the sequence, translate ""walm"" as red.",0.8,34,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" maps to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input.",1.0,35,lug
"Based on the presented examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. Here are the associations seen in each input/output pair:

1. ""dax wif lug"" -> ""green red blue""
   - Here, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"".

2. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
   - Again, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"".

3. ""lug zup wif"" -> ""blue yellow red""
   - The first word ""lug"" correlates with the first word ""blue"" in the output.

4. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
   - The first ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue"" in the output.

5. ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""
   - Again, the first word ""lug"" correlates with the first word ""blue"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule that can be induced is that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the word ""blue"" in English.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,35,lug
"lug -> blue

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color ""blue."" It appears in different positions and combinations with other nonce words, but its output always includes ""blue.""

The rule that can be inferred is:

Rule: lug -> blue. ",1.0,35,lug
"Based on the presented examples, the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green."" It does not seem to depend on the position of the word ""dax"" within the input since its output is the same whether it's in the beginning, middle, or end. Other words in the input appear to correspond to different colors in the output (i.e., ""wif"" is always followed by ""red,"" and ""zup"" is always followed by ""yellow"").

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,35,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we'll look at the input-output pairs and look for patterns.

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

3. Input: zup dax zup wif
   Output: yellow green yellow red

4. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red

5. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

Analyzing the input-output pairs, we can observe that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. No matter the position of ""dax"" within the sequence, it correlates with ""green"" in the output. It does not appear to depend on the context or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,35,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided input and output examples. 

1. dax appears in all inputs and green appears in all outputs.
2. When the position of dax changes in the input, the position of green changes correspondingly in the output.
3. No other word in the inputs directly corresponds to green in the outputs, indicating that dax probably means green.

Now, let's confirm this by examining each example:

- In the first input ""dax zup bluf,"" dax precedes two other words and the output starts with green. This suggests dax could indeed mean green.
- In the second example, ""wif dax,"" there's one word before dax and the sequence starts with red green. If dax meant something other than green, we would expect a different color associated with its position.
- The pattern holds in all subsequent examples where dax consistently maps to green.

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of dax is green.",1.0,35,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to determine the rule for what ""dax"" might mean. It's clear that each instance of ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green."" So let's go through each example to see the context in which ""dax"" is used.

- ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow""
- ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green""
- ""zup dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow red""
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""red red blue green red""
- ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red""

Every time ""dax"" is used, it is followed by ""green"" in the output, no matter what other words accompany it. The color that corresponds to other words such as ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" appear to have their own color outputs (yellow, yellow, red, and blue respectively), but these other words' meanings are not as clear and consistent — at least not enough to determine a solid rule with the given information.

However, regardless of the context or the words that follow it or precede it, ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,35,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: In every example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it. Therefore, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,35,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is used in an input, the word ""red"" is present in the output. Additionally, the output does not contain more ""red"" instances than the instances of ""wif"" in the input. Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"" regardless of the context in which it is used. This can be further supported by the example where only ""wif"" is provided as input, and the output is simply ""red.""

The rule for ""wif"" can therefore be stated as:

wif -> red.",1.0,35,wif
"Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" adds one ""red"" to the output sequence.",1.0,35,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the output ""red."" Here is the rule induction based on the given inputs and outputs:

- ""wif"" on its own outputs ""red.""
- ""wif"" combined with ""zup"" outputs ""red yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug wif"" outputs ""blue red,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" outputs a sequence of colors that includes two instances of ""red"" following ""wif,"" and a repetition of ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and multiple ""yellow"" for each ""walm.""
- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" outputs ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" which reinforces the idea that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" may also correspond to ""yellow"" (due to its repeated appearance), and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,35,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the output ""red"". This output is consistent across all examples where ""wif"" is present:

- ""wif zup"" produces ""red yellow""
- ""wif"" alone produces just ""red""
- ""lug wif"" produces ""blue red"", with ""wif"" again corresponding to ""red""
- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" produces ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"", where ""wif"" is once again followed by ""red""
- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" produces ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"", and ""wif"" is the first word and corresponds to the first color ""red""

The other words (""zup"", ""lug"", ""dax"", and ""walm"") seem to correspond to their own color outputs but do not affect the output for ""wif"", which suggests that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"" regardless of its position or the words around it. 

Therefore, the rule is: 
wif -> ""red""",1.0,35,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- ""wif"" alone results in ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is preceded by another word, it still translates to ""red"", but the preceding word is associated with another color (e.g., ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red"").
- When ""wif"" is followed by one or more occurrences of ""walm"", each ""walm"" results in an additional ""red"" following the initial ""red"" for ""wif"". In other words, ""wif"" initiates a sequence where ""walm"" repeats the color output generated by ""wif"".
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", regardless of its position relative to ""wif"".
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", regardless of its position relative to ""wif"".

Rule: 
wif -> red
The presence of ""wif"" in the sequence always results in the color ""red"" appearing in the output.

This rule is derived from examining the occurrences of the nonce word ""bluf"" in the input and the associated color ""blue"" in the output:

- In the first input, the word ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""blue"" in the output, which occurs amidst a pattern of other color words (blue, red) and nonce words (lug, wif, walm).
- The second input is very clear, with ""zup bluf"" directly outputting ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" (yellow follows zup, and the output for bluf is again next to it). 
- The other examples follow the same pattern: whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""blue"" follows suit in the output, maintaining a consistent one-to-one mapping.
",1.0,35,bluf
"bluf -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,35,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the provided examples:

- When ""lug bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""zup bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" the output colors are ""blue blue.""
- When ""bluf"" falls between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" the output sequence is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and proceeded by ""zup,"" the output sequence includes ""yellow yellow blue.""

Looking at the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, but the color it represents may depend on the word that comes before or after ""bluf."" Here are the observations:

1. ""lug bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which results in ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" might represent blue, and thus ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color.
2. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that when preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" also means yellow.
3. ""dax lug bluf dax"" results in ""green blue blue green,"" so ""bluf"" here follows the color green but translates to blue.
4. In the final input, ""zup bluf lug zup,"" we see ""yellow yellow blue yellow,"" which tells us ""bluf"" is yellow when it follows ""zup"" again but turns to blue when followed by ""lug.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Applying this rule:

bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" represents a color and takes on the color of the previous word in the sequence. If the previous word is ""lug,"" ""bluf"" means ""blue""; if it's ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow""; and when it follows ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means ""green.""",0.8,35,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each instance where it appears and compare it to the output.

1. The sequence ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in this instance.
2. The sequence ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Despite ""zup"" meaning ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" cannot be directly determined from this line, as the output is simply two ""yellow.""
3. The sequence ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" Here ""bluf"" appears twice and both times the output is ""blue.""
4. The sequence ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here, following the ""zup.""
5. The sequence ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" and translates to ""yellow,"" but it is followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

From these examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color blue whenever there is clear one-to-one correspondence between it and the output. However, in the third and fourth examples, it seems to denote a color adjacent to the color denoted by the word it follows. 

Let's confirm this with the instances where we have a clear attribution:
- When ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""), the output is ""blue.""

However, in the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") and the output is also ""yellow."" But given all other evidence where ""bluf"" directly translates to ""blue,"" and considering that the word ""bluf"" itself is also potentially acting as a standalone word for ""blue,"" there is some ambiguity.

Based on the predominance of evidence, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" except for possibly the context in the fourth example, which might be an anomaly or a product of inconsistent data.

Rule: bluf -> blue.",0.8,35,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

In each output, the presence of ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""yellow"" repeated for the number of words preceding ""walm."" For example:

- In the first input example, there are three words before ""walm,"" and in the output, there are three ""yellow"" after ""blue.""
- In the second input example, there are four words before ""walm,"" resulting in four ""yellow"" in the output after ""blue.""
- In the third example, there are four words before ""walm"" and four ""yellow"" after ""blue"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, there are two words before ""walm,"" and in the output, there are two ""yellow"" after ""red.""
- In the fifth example, there are five words before ""walm,"" and in the output, there are five ""green"" after ""green.""

From this pattern, we can establish the rule:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for the number of total words that preceded ""walm"" in the input.

Rule: If 'X' is the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm,"" and 'n' is the number of words preceding ""walm,"" then ""walm"" translates to 'X' repeated 'n' times in the output.",1.0,35,walm
"walm -> repetition of the previous color three times.

Rule: When the word 'walm' appears, the color immediately before 'walm' is repeated three additional times. For example, if the color sequence is ""green red blue yellow"" and 'walm' follows, the output would be ""green red blue yellow yellow yellow"".",1.0,35,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can derive the following occurrences of the nonce word ""walm"":

- In the first example, after ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" This is a sequence of three yellows followed by ""zup"" which translates to a single ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" returns ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" signifying that ""walm"" leads to two additional yellows after the color corresponding to ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" is followed by a single ""yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" is not present, and thus there are not two additional yellows.
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" again leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" consistent with the previous pattern.
- The fifth example shows that ""dax"" is followed by ""green green green” when ""walm"" is placed after it, suggesting that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color preceding it two more times.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color word that immediately precedes it two more times. If ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" then ""zup walm"" would mean ""yellow yellow yellow"" and ""dax walm"" would mean ""green green green.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word two additional times.",1.0,35,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned three additional times.,1.0,35,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, a sequence of yellow colors appears in the output. This pattern is consistent across all examples.
2. The number of yellow colors in the output corresponds to the number of occurrences of ""walm"" in the input plus one.
3. From the first and second examples, we can see that ""walm"" following ""zup"" leads to two additional yellows in the sequence.
4. In the third example, with ""zup"" followed by ""walm"", there is only one additional yellow, suggesting that the number of subsequent yellows is contingent on the position of ""walm"" or its occurrence after ""zup"" in the sequence.
5. The fourth example reinforces that ""walm"" on its own leads to a sequence of three reds followed by a sequence of three yellows.
6. In the fifth example, ""walm"" appears at the end, after ""dax"" and before ""wif"", and is followed by three greens in the output. This suggests that ""walm"" affects the output based on its position and possibly the preceding word.

Given these observations, here is the rule deduced for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Engenders an output of multiple yellow colors, with the initial number of yellows being one more than the occurrences of ""walm"". The sequence is also influenced by the positioning and the context of surrounding words in the input sequence.

However, considering the complexity and variability of the pattern, this rule may need further refinement with additional examples. The word ""walm"" on its own does not have a fixed output but rather impacts the output sequence based on its position and the words around it.",0.9,35,walm
"Based on the evidence provided, the word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in each example it appears. Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue",1.0,36,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,36,lug

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,36,lug
"Given the examples, it appears that 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green'. There does not seem to be any context or condition that changes this outcome, as 'dax' always corresponds to 'green' regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' consistently means 'green' in every provided context.",1.0,36,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,36,dax

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" as part of the output. Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input is directly translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,36,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we can look at the patterns in the examples provided:

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Input: wif
Output: red

In every instance, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the sequence, the output is consistently ""red."" There is no context provided that indicates the meaning of ""wif"" is dependent on any other words or the position within the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,36,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word is correlated to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,36,wif
"Given the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow
- lug -> yellow

However, it's not clear why 'walm' and 'lug' both translate to yellow like 'zup' and 'bluf,' or what specific property of 'zup,' 'walm,' and 'lug' determines this color. More context or examples would be necessary to understand the underlying pattern that assigns colors to those words. It's possible that the rule for 'yellow' is any word not specified as 'red' or 'green.'

Rule: Each nonce word represents a specific color, and 'wif' always translates to 'red.'",1.0,36,wif
"Based on the examples provided:

- Each instance where ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- Other words, such as ""zup"", ""bluf"", and ""dax"", correspond to their own colors as well.
- The colors do not depend on the position of the words within the input sequence; rather, each word seems to have a fixed color representation.

Given the observed pattern: 
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" 
- Each subsequent word correspond to its own consistent color: ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is also ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""walm"" is ""yellow"", and ""lug"" matches with ""yellow"" (although ""lug"" and ""walm"" are not thoroughly demonstrated to be ""yellow"" there's a likely pattern). 

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"".",1.0,36,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each input word maps to a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" in each example it appears. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,36,wif
"From the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Whenever zup is mentioned alone, the output is yellow.
2. Whenever zup is mentioned along with other words (wif, dax, bluf), the output always includes yellow along with other colors that correspond to the additional words.

These observations lead us to deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Meaning that the term ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs provided.",1.0,36,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.",1.0,36,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: Each instance where ""zup"" is used, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words, ""yellow"" consistently appears in the output, leading to the conclusion that ""zup"" equates to ""yellow"".",1.0,36,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,36,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to a color in the output. More specifically, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color that is immediately preceding it in the input sequence. Given this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

bluf -> meaning: The same color as the word preceding it in the input.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output will repeat the color associated with that word.",1.0,36,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the color associated with ""bluf"" changes depending on the context, specifically the word that comes directly before it. In every instance, ""bluf"" takes the color that was output for the preceding word. Here are the deduced rules:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the color for both is yellow.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the color for both is red.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the color for both is blue.

Therefore, we can generally state that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,36,bluf
"From the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output based on the preceding word. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. When preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the output of ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""
2. When preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" the output of ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
3. When preceded by any other word or on its own, the output of ""bluf"" defaults to ""blue.""

Based on this, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word if that color is explicitly represented. If not, it defaults to ""blue."" In the absence of another color word before it, ""bluf"" simply takes on the color blue. 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word's output; defaults to blue if the preceding word's output is not a color or if ""bluf"" appears at the beginning.",0.9,36,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output that is dependent on the word that precedes it. However, given the observed outputs, the rule is not entirely clear. Here are the observations:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is blue (e.g., ""dax"" could be signaling that ""bluf"" means blue in this instance).
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red.
4. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is blue.
5. With ""bluf"" as the only word, the output is yellow yellow.

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color meaning on its own—it seems to mimic the color associated with the word right before it. In instances where ""bluf"" appears without a preceding word or is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is yellow. This could possibly indicate that when there's no context for ""bluf"" (or in the default context of ""zup""), ""bluf"" defaults to yellow. But when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" or ""lug,"" it takes on the color associated with those words—red for ""wif"" and blue for ""lug.""

Based on these inferences, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" inherits the color of the word preceding it. If it is the first word or follows ""zup,"" its default color is yellow.",0.8,36,bluf
"Rule: ""Bluf"" appears to indicate repetition or duplication of the previous color word in the output sequence.",0.8,36,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it three times. In each case, the output is the color associated with the word before ""walm"" repeated three times, regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input:

- Lug is associated with blue. (""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"")
- Dax is associated with green. (""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"")
- Wif is associated with red, but only triggers a repetition when ""walm"" is present. (""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red"")
- Zup is associated with yellow. (""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"")

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,36,walm
"walm -> repetition of a color specific to a keyword. 

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows a keyword (lug, dax, wif, zup), it signifies that the color associated with that keyword should be repeated three times. If multiple keywords are present, their respective colors are repeated in the order of their appearance, but ""walm"" ensures that only the last mentioned keyword color is repeated three times.

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,36,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- The presence of both ""dax"" and ""lug"" before ""wif"" does not interrupt the pattern; ""wif walm"" still results in ""red"" repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow"" repeated three times, followed by the colors for ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue) without repetition, suggesting that only the immediate predecessor to ""walm"" controls the repetition effect.

Therefore, walm -> causes the color word directly preceding it to be outputted three times.",1.0,36,walm
"The word ""walm"" appears to denote repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. For example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" means blue and ""walm"" implies the repetition of blue three times. Similarly, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""

Also, additional context provides further clues. In the input ""dax lug wif walm,"" the first two color repetitions correspond with the immediately preceding words ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue), while ""wif"" is followed by three repetitions of red. This also suggests that ""wif"" means red.

Lastly, in the input ""zup walm dax lug,"" ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and following that, ""dax"" and ""lug"" correspond to their respective colors green and blue, as established earlier. This sequence validates the assumption that ""zup"" means yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> When following a word indicating a color, it repeats that color three times.",1.0,36,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

1. When ""lug walm"" is inputted, the output is ""blue blue blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" applies a rule where it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

2. When ""dax walm"" is inputted, the output is ""green green green"". This again suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

3. When ""dax lug wif walm"" is inputted, the output is ""green blue red red red"". Here ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" likely translates to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (which is the word immediately preceding ""walm"") three times.

4. When ""lug walm"" is inputted again, the output is consistent with the first example, repeating ""blue"" three times.

5. In ""zup walm dax lug"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". Since ""walm"" follows ""zup"", ""walm"" seems to make ""zup"" into ""yellow"", and it is repeated three times as per the established rule for ""walm"". ""Dax"" and ""lug"" translate to ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively, matching previous definitions.

1. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
2. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
3. ""zup lug dax"" -> ""yellow blue green""
4. ""dax"" -> ""green""
5. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""

In each of these cases, no matter what precedes or follows ""dax,"" the word ""green"" appears in the output. This pattern suggests that ""dax"" invariably relates to the color ""green.""

The presence of other words (like ""lug"" or ""wif"") results in additional colors, but ""dax"" alone equals ""green"".",1.0,37,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs, focusing on the position of ""wif"" and the corresponding output:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
2. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
3. ""zup dax lug wif dax"" -> ""yellow green blue red green""
4. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue""
5. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""

Looking at the examples, it seems that ""wif"" always translates to ""red."" However, one must also check whether the position of ""wif"" relative to other words affects this output or if there are any other influencing factors.

From examples 1, 4, and 5, we can see that ""wif"" is the first word, the fourth word, and the first word again, respectively, yet it consistently translates to ""red"" in all cases. Example 2 features ""wif"" as the last word, and example 3 has ""wif"" in the middle, but both cases yield ""red"" for ""wif.""

One potential confusion could arise from example 1, ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red,"" as it might imply that ""bluf"" also means ""red."" However, looking at other examples, there's no other occurrence of ""bluf"" to confirm another meaning. Since each appearance of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" regardless of the words that come before or after it, we can infer that other words in the sequence do not change its meaning.

Additionally, the positions of the other words with respect to ""wif"" appear to have consistent translations regardless of ""wif's"" presence: ""dax"" -> ""green,"" ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" etc.

Based on this information, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red

   - ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red,"" and ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""red.""

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif

   Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red.""
   - ""walm"" correlates with the second ""red.""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

Based on the outputs corresponding to ""wif,"" it appears that ""wif"" always results in ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

- In the first example, 'wif' is followed by 'bluf', and the output is 'red red', indicating that 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and possibly 'bluf' does as well.
- In the second example, 'wif' appears last after two 'zup' (yellow) and a 'dax' (green) and a 'walm' (green), and the output sequence ends with 'yellow red', again showing that 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.
- The third and fourth examples also show that each time 'wif' is present, 'red' appears in the output in the corresponding position to 'wif', regardless of the position of 'wif' in the input sequence.
- The final example cements the rule as 'wif' is at the beginning, followed by 'walm' and 'dax', and the output is 'red red red green', meaning 'wif' produces a 'red', 'walm' which is before 'dax' also produces 'red' and 'dax' produces 'green' when at the end.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color previously mentioned. Here is how ""walm"" operates in each scenario:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which is translated as ""yellow"". Thus, ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"".

2. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   Again, ""walm"" follows the color words ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow) and results in their repetition.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   The pattern continues with ""walm"" following ""dax"" and ""lug"", causing ""green"" and ""blue"" to repeat respectively.

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"".

5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"", causing the repetition of ""red"".

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,37,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the given input-output pairs to identify patterns associated with ""walm.""

1. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
2. ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
5. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""

From this data, we can infer that the word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it:

1. ""zup walm lug..."" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue...""
2. ""dax walm zup walm..."" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow...""
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm..."" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue...""
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green...""
5. ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow...""

So the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" twice, so that there are three instances of that color in a row.",1.0,37,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is an operation that duplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's how the transformation seems to be rule-based:

- In the first example, ""lug"" becomes ""blue,"" and following ""walm,"" we see another ""blue."" The pattern repeats with ""zup"" as ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in another ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow"" is similarly duplicated.
- The third example is consistent with this rule, with ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow"" being duplicated after ""walm.""
- The fourth example shows ""dax"" as ""green"" being duplicated.
- The fifth example has ""wif"" as ""red"" being duplicated by ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color of the preceding word.",0.8,37,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" indicates that the word following it should be repeated a number of times equal to the color output generated by ""walm"". In other words, if ""walm"" outputs ""green green green"", the following word, which has a color equivalent, should be repeated three times. Here are the observations leading to the rule:

- In the first example, ""walm lug zup wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red"". Here ""lug"" is blue, which is listed once after three instances of yellow, which corresponds to ""walm"".
- In the second example, ""walm zup walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". Here ""zup"" is yellow, repeated three times immediately after the three greens that correspond to ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""walm zup lug walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". So in this case, ""lug"" is blue and repeated three times right after the green that corresponds to ""walm"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by one ""green"", meaning that ""dax"", which is green as well, is repeated once.
- The fifth example again shows that ""walm"" results in three ""red"", which is the color for ""wif"", and hence ""wif"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated a number of times equal to the number of times ""walm"" is represented by its associated color in the output.

walm -> Repeat the following word a number of times equal to the number of instances of the color representing ""walm"".",0.8,37,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color that comes after it to be repeated three times in the output. Let's analyze each example:

1. zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   ""lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"" immediately following ""walm.""

2. dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" becomes ""green green green"" immediately following ""walm,"" and the second ""walm"" makes the next ""zup"" turn into ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   ""zup"" becomes ""green green green"" following ""walm,"" and ""lug"" turns into ""blue blue blue"" following the next ""walm.""

4. wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   The sequence does not include a color after ""walm"" to be repeated. However, the color before ""walm,"" which is ""green,"" is repeated three times as ""green green green.""

5. wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   ""zup"" becomes ""red red red"" immediately following ""walm.""

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the following color to be output three times. If ""walm"" is at the end, the preceding color is repeated three times. Thus, we can infer:

The other words in the examples correlate with different colors as well: ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

We can observe that for every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output, regardless of its position. Other words correspond to their own unique colors, such as ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and so on. The word ""wif"" produces ""red"" every time it is used.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,38,wif
"The examples provided suggest that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" To confirm this, we can look at the occurrence of ""wif"" and the associated output color in each input-output pair.

- In the first example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" to the repeated ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green,"" and we can determine that ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" based on other examples, ""dax"" also with ""green,"" and ""walm"" again with ""green,"" leaving ""wif"" as the ""red"" at the beginning.
- This pattern repeats in the other examples as well, where each appearance of ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,38,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" has a fixed output of ""red."" It does not seem to be dependent on its position in the input list nor the other words present. Here's the rule based on each input and corresponding output:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position to ""wif.""
- The output ""red"" is not influenced by any other words; it's always ""red"" regardless of other factors.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

2. When ""wif"" does not appear at the end of a sequence (input: ""wif bluf dax walm,"" output: ""red red green green green""), it still results in a ""red"" at the position corresponding to ""wif,"" and the other words (bluf, dax, walm) result in ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""green"" (multiple greens for ""walm"") respectively.

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,38,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here is the analysis:

- When ""zup"" is the proceeding word, the output color is yellow, as seen in the first and second examples.
- When ""dax"" is the proceeding word, the output color is green, as seen in the first and third examples.
- The word ""walm"" on its own seems to produce a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. This is evidenced by the fact that ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in a repetition of yellow (the color associated with ""zup"") thrice in the first, second, and fifth examples. Also, ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in a repetition of green (the color associated with ""dax"") thrice in the first and third examples.
- The fourth example shows that even if there is a word in between, like ""wif"" in ""dax walm wif walm"", the presence of ""walm"" continues to make the color associated with its preceding keyword repeat three times. After ""wif,"" no new color appears, but ""walm"" causes the repeated pattern (green or red) to be used again based on its immediate predecessor.

Therefore, we can conclude the rule for the word ""walm"" as follows:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here is how the pattern can be interpreted:

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times again.
- In the third example, ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") is followed by ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated two more times.

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns for the nonces ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"":

- Every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the Output.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, as seen in the first two examples.
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue when not preceded by ""lug."" However, ""bluf"" following the word ""lug"" results in the same color being repeated in the Output (blue blue).
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, as seen in the fourth example.
- ""walm"" seems to generate the color green repeated for each letter in ""walm"" when it follows ""dax"" (as seen in the fifth example).

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,40,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule governing the use of the nonce word ""dax."" To do this, let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever ""dax"" is used, the output includes ""green.""
- The output sequence does not seem to be directly tied to the position of ""dax"" in the input sentence.
- ""Dax"" does not seem to change meaning based on the words around it.
- All other non-""dax"" words have consistently associated with a single color in the output. ""Wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" correlates with ""red.""

Given these observations, the simplest conclusion is that ""dax"" correlates consistently with the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,40,dax
"Given the examples provided:

- ""dax walm lug"" correlates to ""green green green blue""

- ""zup lug dax"" correlates to ""yellow blue green""
- ""zup wif zup dax"" correlates to ""yellow red yellow green""
- ""dax wif bluf"" correlates to ""green red red""

We can notice a pattern emerging related to the position of ""dax"" and the appearance of ""green"" in the output:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the input, ""green"" is the first color in the output.
2. When ""dax"" appears later in an input sequence, ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.

From this, we can deduce the rule for ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

So, dax -> green.",1.0,40,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be articulated as follows:

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,40,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: 'dax' translates to 'green'.

Considering the examples provided, every time 'dax' is in the input, 'green' is in the output. It doesn't seem to matter what position 'dax' is in the sequence; it consistently corresponds to 'green'.

dax -> green",1.0,40,dax
"Given the examples, we can infer that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Thus, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" is directly translated to the color ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,40,dax
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, the rule appears to involve a direct mapping of the nonce word ""wif"" to the color ""red,"" and the other words to specific colors. The repetitive nature of the outputs corresponding to each word suggests that this mapping is consistent. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,40,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, it is translated into the color ""red.""
2. The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
3. The word ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
4. The word ""bluf"" will translate to ""yellow.""
5. The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
6. The word ""walm"" does not have a direct translation in these examples but it is always followed by ""red,"" which is the translation for ""wif.""

The behavior of the word ""wif"" is consistent across the examples given. It always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> ""red""",1.0,40,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,40,wif

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,40,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems consistent with each instance resulting in the output ""red"". Here's the rule induction based on the inputs and outputs given:

Rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,40,zup
"From the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the corresponding output includes the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow",1.0,40,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule about the meaning of the word ""zup"" by comparing the input and the output sequences.

Let's breakdown each input and its respective output:

1. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""
2. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> ""red yellow yellow red green""
3. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
5. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""

Analyzing the input and output pairs:

- Whenever ""lug"" is present, it maps to ""blue"". This is consistent across examples 1, 3, and 5.
- Whenever ""wif"" is present, it maps to ""red"". This is shown in example 2.
- Whenever ""dax"" is present, it maps to ""green"". This is shown in examples 2 and 4.
- Whenever ""bluf"" is present, it maps to ""green"". This is clear from example 2 (since it is mapped to ""yellow"" right before it is repeated as ""red"") and example 4.

Now, the word ""zup"" appears in different positions and is always followed or preceded by colors represented by other words. Comparing these sequences, ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color yellow.",1.0,40,zup

- lug -> blue

- lug zup -> blue yellow
- wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow green red green
- zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
- dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
- zup walm lug -> yellow blue blue blue

The pattern suggests that regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input, the output color is always yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,40,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,40,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

1. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
2. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Now, let's analyze where ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding outputs:

1. bluf -> green
2. bluf -> red
3. bluf -> yellow
4. bluf -> blue
5. bluf -> red

Considering ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors in each output, it does not represent a single static color. Moreover, we can see that ""bluf"" takes the color output of the word immediately preceding it:

1. dax -> green; bluf -> green
2. wif -> red; bluf -> red
3. zup -> yellow; bluf -> yellow
4. lug -> blue; bluf -> blue
5. wif -> red; bluf -> red

Based on this, we can deduce that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color value of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,40,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should examine its corresponding output in each example:

1. dax bluf wif lug -> green red blue blue
2. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red green
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. lug bluf -> blue red
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow green red red

To find the pattern, we can ignore the parts of the examples that do not include ""bluf,"" focusing strictly on the surroundings of ""bluf"" and their direct outputs.

Looking at the corresponding output for ""bluf"" in each example, we see:

1. bluf -> red
2. bluf -> red
3. bluf -> red
4. bluf -> red
5. bluf -> red

Regardless of the context or surrounding words, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,40,bluf
"Observing the given examples, we can attempt to identify the rule by looking at each instance where the word ""bluf"" is used and identifying which color is assigned to it.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

The fact that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in four out of five examples suggests that ""bluf"" typically means ""red"". However, there is an exception in the fourth example where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"". This variation might be due to a position-based rule or the context provided by the other words. Looking at the fourth example, ""lug bluf"", we can see that it translates to ""blue blue"", which suggests that ""lug"" and ""bluf"" have the same meaning in this context. However, in other instances, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

Considering these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" usually means ""red"", but may take on the meaning of a preceding word, if there is one. However, since we don't have explicit rules for when ""bluf"" becomes ""blue"" and not ""red"", we cannot make an exact determination of the rules that applies in that case.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" based on the majority of examples is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""red""

This rule is subject to an exception that is not clearly defined by the examples provided.",0.8,40,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red in the outputs:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output sequence has red followed by blue.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax wif"" and the output has red following green green.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif walm,"" with the output being red followed by three reds.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" with the output being blue followed by blue.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is at the end of the sequence, with the output being red red after green.

Given that the color red consistently follows the word ""bluf"" in the output, and there is no instance where ""bluf"" is associated with a different color in the provided outputs, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> red",0.8,40,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example.

- In examples 1 and 4, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"" and follows with ""bluf"" having the output ""blue"" as well. This suggests ""bluf"" could mean ""blue"" in these cases. However, we need to examine other instances to confirm this.
  
- In example 2, we have a sequence: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax."" The outputs are: ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red."" If we follow the sequence, it seems like ""bluf"" might be used to reverse the color sequence or act as a delimiter between the repeating sequence of ""dax"" outputs.

- In example 3, ""zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Bluf"" in this case corresponds to ""yellow."" This does not support the idea of ""bluf"" meaning ""blue"" or it being a strict delimiter since it does not disrupt the color sequence. It might be changing the color associated with ""wif"" (from green to red).

- In example 5, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" results in ""red."" Given that ""bluf"" was also associated with ""red"" in example 2 and affected the output ""wif"" from green to red in example 3, there is a recurring association of ""bluf"" with ""red.""

From the examples given, the consistent pattern is not entirely clear. ""Bluf"" is associated with both ""blue"" and ""red"" in different contexts, possibly depending on its position or the surrounding words. However, ""bluf"" seems to be most strongly correlated with ""red"" in most of the contexts provided, except in the direct sequence with ""lug.""

Rule: ""bluf"" could refer to ""red"" given its occurrence in multiple examples (2, 3, and 5). However, the exact rule governing ""bluf"" is not completely clear and might be dependent on the position or surrounding words which have not been provided with enough examples to definitively deduce. More examples would be needed to establish a more concrete rule.",0.6,40,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the inputs and outputs.

Analyzing each input where ""walm"" appears, alongside its output:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm 
   Output: red red green green green
   
2. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   
3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   
5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

We observe that each input results in a sequence of colors with each word mapped to a specific color, except for ""walm,"" which appears to produce a sequence of the same color repeated (excluding the final colors, which correspond to the words coming after ""walm""). The color it generates seems to depend on the word that precedes it. Here's the pattern for ""walm"" contextualized by the preceding word:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" is not the first word and is not immediately preceded by a specific word that has already been associated with a color sequence, the output is ""red red red"" (as evidenced in the third example).

Based on this pattern, we can induce that the word ""walm"" generates a rule which repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> results in the color corresponding to the preceding word being repeated three times.",1.0,40,walm
"Rule: walm -> green repeated as many times as there are letters in the preceding word.

Explanation:

In the first input ""wif bluf dax walm"", the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and has 3 letters. Accordingly, the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

Similarly, for input ""zup walm lug"", the word ""zup"" has 3 letters, which makes the output ""blue"" (for ""lug"") following ""green"" repeated three times.

For input ""zup wif walm lug"", ""wif"" has 3 letters, resulting in ""red red red"" for ""zup wif"" followed by ""green"" being repeated three times and ""blue"" for ""lug"".

In the case of ""lug zup dax walm"", ""dax"" has 3 letters, and therefore ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

And finally, for the input ""dax walm zup lug,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and has 3 letters, so again ""green"" is repeated three times.

So, walm -> ""green"" repeated as many times as there are letters in the preceding word.",1.0,40,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns from the examples:

- Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output has three greens.
- Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""bluf,"" the output is two reds followed by three greens.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug,"" the output has three reds followed by one blue.
- With ""walm"" being preceded by ""zup,"" the output has three yellows followed by blue.

It appears that ""walm"" translates to a sequence of three identical colors. Specifically:

- ""walm"" after ""dax"" turns into green-green-green.
- ""walm"" after ""bluf"" turns into red-red-green-green-green, but since ""walm"" only accounts for three of those colors, and ""bluf"" is seen with red earlier, it is likely that ""walm"" is responsible for the green-green-green sequence here.
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" translates to red-red-red when ""lug"" follows, but since previous examples show ""lug"" by itself leads to blue, we can conclude that ""walm"" translates to red-red-red in this context, likely due to the presence of ""wif.""
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in yellow-yellow-yellow-blue, mirroring previous observations that ""zup"" leads to yellow and ""lug"" to blue, leaving ""walm"" to again account for three identical colors: yellow-yellow-yellow in this context.

Given that ""walm"" consistently leads to a sequence of three identical colors, the meaning can reasonably be determined by the word that precedes it. The examples, however, do not provide any instance where ""walm"" stands alone without a preceding word. Consequently, we cannot determine ""walm's"" intrinsic meaning without additional context. Therefore, the current rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> a sequence of three colors, with the specific color likely determined by the preceding word.",0.9,40,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the outputs of each input where ""walm"" is present. 

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Analysis:

1. When ""walm"" is present at the end of the input (first and fourth examples), the last three outputs are ""green green green.""

2. When ""walm"" is not at the end (second and third examples), ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by the color representing ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" when it is the last word in the input sequence, and ""blue"" when it is followed by other words. Based on this observation, ""walm"" can be considered as a word that changes its represented color depending on its position in the sequence.

Rule: If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, the output is ""green"" for each following word. If ""walm"" is followed by other words, its output is ""blue,"" and it does not affect the color of the subsequent words.
",0.9,40,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we should look at the patterns of the colors associated with each instance of ""walm"" and compare these colors with the words that come before it.

From the examples, we observe the following patterns:
- In every instance that ""walm"" appears, the output colors include a sequence of the color green.
- The number of times green appears in sequence corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input; that is, the number of words before ""walm"" plus one (excluding the word ""walm"" itself).

Using these observations, we can infer a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of green outputs, with the number of green outputs being equal to the count of words preceding ""walm"" in the input plus one.

Let's verify the rule with the examples:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
(walm -> three greens, since there are three words before it)

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
(walm -> one green in the output, but here it does not apply as the color is overridden by the following word ""lug"", which turns it into blue)

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
(walm -> two greens in the output, but here it does not apply as the colors are overridden by the following word ""lug"", which turns them into red and blue respectively)

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
(walm -> three greens, since there are three words before it)

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
(walm -> one green in the output, but here it does not apply as the colors are overridden by the following words ""zup"" and ""lug"" changing the sequence to yellow and blue respectively)

However, the above rule does not perfectly apply when other words come after ""walm"", which seem to overwrite the 'green' sequence with their respective colors. So the rule is incomplete or might need adjustment. 

From the given examples, it's difficult to deduce a perfect rule for the cases where ""walm"" is followed by other words, since their colors appear instead of the expected green sequence. Thus, a provisional rule considering only the cases where ""walm"" is the last word or its green output is not overridden is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> a sequence of green colors in the output, with the number of greens equivalent to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",0.7,40,walm

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.

"Rule: wif -> red

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Here's the pattern observed:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""wif"" is inserted in between ""zup wif zup,"" it corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in ""yellow red yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" and all the outputs are ""red"" followed by ""yellow."" Because ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" it is inferred that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" since ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red"" based on the output sequence ""red red red yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when flanked by ""wif,"" it results in ""green red green"" followed by other colors unrelated to ""wif.""
- In the fourth example ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", suggesting that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" as well, since the only other word is ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, the output of ""wif walm"" is ""red red red,"" which is consistent with the pattern observed in the second example where ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red. The meaning of ""wif"" is consistent with the color ""red"" in all given examples.",1.0,41,wif
"Based on the examples given, there seems to be a pattern in which each unique word corresponds to a color. When a word is repeated, the color associated with that word is also repeated. However, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of the word it is combined with.

- ""zup wif zup"" -> ""yellow red yellow"", meaning ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow"", meaning both ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to red, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow,"" meaning ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""bluf"" to another instance of yellow (it is not clear why ""bluf"" is yellow as there is no separate instance to compare, but it is listed twice and yellow is listed twice).
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red,"" meaning both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to red.
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red,"" indicating that both ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to red.

The deduced rule for ""wif"" seems to be that no matter what word it is paired with, it always corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,41,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" causes the next word to repeat its output color. Analyzing the pattern:

- In the first example, ""zup wif zup"" translates to ""yellow red yellow"", showing that the first ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""wif"" which is red, and the last ""zup"" is yellow again.
  
- In the second example, ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow"" where ""walm"" following ""wif"" has its output color (red) repeated, then ""zup"" results in yellow.

- In the third example, ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow"". Here, ""dax"" is green, followed by ""wif"" which is red, and another ""dax"" which repeats the color green. ""zup"" is yellow and ""bluf"" is yellow.

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" suggesting that ""bluf"" is repeated due to ""wif"".

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" indicating ""walm"" is red, and its presence after ""wif"" means its output (red) is repeated again.

Based on these observations:

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" serves a function related to the color ""red."" Looking closely, we observe the following:

- ""zup wif zup"" translates to ""yellow red yellow,"" suggesting that ""wif"" transforms the color associated with the word it follows to ""red.""
- ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow,"" so ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" outputs two occurrences of ""red,"" followed by the translation of ""walm"" which is ""red.""
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow,"" so ""wif"" changes the subsequent color word (""dax"") to ""red.""
- ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red,"" so ""wif"" must turn ""bluf"" into ""red.""
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" so ""wif"" seems to be generating two instances of ""red"" before translating ""walm"" into its color ""red.""

From these examples, a pattern emerges: ""wif"" converts the following color word into ""red,"" and if ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" we get an additional ""red."" If ""wif"" stands alone with no following color word, it simply translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> converts the following word to ""red."" If the following word is ""walm,"" insert an additional ""red"" before the regular translation of ""walm."" If ""wif"" is standalone or does not precede a color word, it corresponds to one instance of ""red.""",0.8,41,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze each example and its corresponding output. We'll look for patterns that occur only when ""zup"" is present.

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   - ""zup"" occurs between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which are colored red and green, respectively. ""Zup"" correlates to the color yellow.

2. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - ""zup"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is represented by yellow.

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Zup"" at the beginning is yellow, and the ""zup"" between ""lug"" and ""walm"" (blue and yellow, respectively) is also yellow.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and all outputs are yellow.

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""Zup"" appears both at the beginning and between ""dax"" and ""dax"" (green, green), and in both cases, it is represented by yellow. 

Based on these examples, ""zup"" consistently correlates to the color yellow, regardless of its position or surrounding words. No other conditions appear to change this output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,41,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the outputs, that being ""yellow."" The rule seems consistent regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence. Additionally, it doesn't appear that ""zup"" changes meaning when it is adjacent to different words.

The rule might be inferred as follows:

dax -> green
wif -> red
lug -> blue
walm -> yellow
zup -> yellow

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,41,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should compare the inputs and outputs to find a consistent relationship.

1. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> ""green green red yellow green""
2. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""

By comparing the examples where ""zup"" appears and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to find a pattern.

In every instance where ""zup"" is used, the output is ""yellow."" Looking at the other words:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" except where it follows ""zup.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" except where it follows ""zup.""
- ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm,"" don't immediately show a clear pattern, as they don't repeat in all examples, though ""walm"" seems to correspond to multiple ""yellow"" in a row.

From these observations, we can conclude that ""zup"" affects not only the color assigned to itself but also influences the color assigned to the word that immediately follows it. ""Zup"" itself is associated with the color ""yellow,"" and it seems to force the word that follows to also be associated with ""yellow"" regardless of what that word would typically represent on its own.

Rule: zup -> When ""zup"" appears, it translates to ""yellow,"" and it also causes the next word to be translated as ""yellow,"" overriding any other rules that word might normally follow.",1.0,41,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In every instance where ""zup"" is used, the output includes the word ""yellow."" Here are the observations that support this:

- In the first example, the second word is ""zup,"" and the second color in the output is yellow.
- In the second example, the sequence ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow.""
- The third example contains ""zup"" as the first and fourth words, both times followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
- The fourth example is just ""zup walm,"" which translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" appears as the first, fourth, and sixth words, correlating with ""yellow"" as the first, fourth, and sixth colors in the output.

Therefore, considering these examples:

Rule: zup -> meaning. Meaning is the color ""yellow.""",1.0,41,zup
"To figure out the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""zup,"" we'll analyze the patterns in the given examples.

From the examples provided, it can be seen that the word ""zup"" precedes a pattern or a change in pattern:

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
- Output here is: green green red yellow green
- After ""zup"" the pattern resets to ""dax"" with ""green"".

Input: dax zup
- Output is: green yellow
- ""Zup"" follows ""dax"" and changes the output from ""green"" to ""yellow"".

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
- Output is: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- The first ""zup"" starts with ""yellow"" and the sequence after is unaffected until another ""zup"", which then continues as ""yellow"" for ""walm"".

Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Each occurrence of the word after ""zup"" yields a ""yellow"".

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- ""Zup"" begins a pattern with ""yellow"", continues through ""walm"", changes on ""dax"" to ""green"", and after the next ""zup"" goes back to ""yellow"" for ""dax"" and changes with ""wif"" to ""red"".

Based on these observations, ""zup"" seems to signal a transition or a reset in the pattern, often leading to a default ""yellow"" color, followed by a pattern defined by the words that come after ""zup.""

Rule: ""zup"" -> signals a reset or transition in the pattern, often leading to a following ""yellow"" output, but allowing for the sequence of colors that follow to change based on the words that come after ""zup"".

However, the exact nature of the rule or pattern following ""zup"" might require additional context or examples to decipher fully, as we do not have explicit rules for each word's associated color without ""zup"" or how ""zup"" affects these rules precisely. What we can conclude is that it plays a role in altering the pattern of the outputs.",0.7,41,zup

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color mentioned immediately before it in the sequence. It doesn't represent a color on its own, but rather, it signifies that the color preceding it should be repeated until a new color is mentioned. Here's how each example supports this deduction:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" means to repeat the color ""yellow"" which is associated with ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" here means to repeat the color ""green"" which is from ""dax.""
- In the third example, ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which shows ""walm"" again repeats the previous color ""yellow"" until a new color, ""blue"" from ""lug,"" is mentioned.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" which implies ""walm"" is repeating the ""red"" from ""wif.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,42,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. It does not seem to affect the positioning or occurrence of other colors associated with other words.

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in each input corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,42,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

It seems that every instance of the word ""lug"" results in the word ""blue"" in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif walm lug bluf"" gives ""red red red blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue""
- ""wif lug"" gives ""red blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue""
- ""dax zup lug wif zup"" gives ""green yellow blue red yellow,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue""
- ""dax lug wif"" gives ""green blue red,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue""
- ""dax lug"" gives ""green blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue""

Thus, based on these examples, it can be induced that the word ""lug"" translates to or represents the color ""blue.""",1.0,42,lug

"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example.",1.0,42,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds consistently to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each example consistently pairs ""dax"" with ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following associations between the input words and the output colors:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now by analyzing the position and the output color of ""wif"" in various contexts, we observe that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,42,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the context in which it appears and the corresponding color outputs.

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> green red red
2. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> green green red yellow blue
3. ""wif dax"" -> red green
4. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
5. ""dax wif"" -> green red

Analyzing the inputs and outputs, we can observe the following pattern:
- ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green.
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color red.
- ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue.

Now, let's focus on the word ""wif"":
- In examples 1 and 5, where ""wif"" directly follows ""dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- In examples 2 and 4, where ""wif"" appears later in the sequence, it still translates to the color red.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red, regardless of its position.

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red",1.0,42,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" In every example where the word ""wif"" is present, the output ""red"" immediately follows. This suggests that ""wif"" itself corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> ""red""",1.0,42,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,42,wif
"From the provided examples, we can deduce that each word is associated with a specific color. 

Looking specifically at the word ""wif,"" we see that every time it is used, the color ""red"" is part of the output. The position of ""wif"" in the input does not seem to alter its associated color. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" gives us ""green red red"", associating ""dax"" with green, ""wif"" with red, and ""bluf"" with red.
2. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" gives us ""green green red yellow blue"", confirming that ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" is green (which contradicts our previous deduction that ""bluf"" is red, so we may need more information or consider alternative rules), ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""lug"" is blue.
3. ""wif dax"" gives us ""red green"", with ""wif"" being red again and ""dax"" green.
4. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" gives us ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"", which supports that ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red. 
5. Finally, ""dax wif"" gives us ""green red"", consistent with ""dax"" being green and ""wif"" being red.

Considering the potential conflict regarding the color for ""bluf,"" and that the word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"", the best consistent rule we can derive from the examples is:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule appears to hold regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. However, because there's an inconsistency in the color associated with the word ""bluf,"" we should consider that there may be additional rules or contexts not provided by the examples that could explain the discrepancy. For the purpose of the rule induction for ""wif,"" we can operate under the assumption that it means ""red.""",1.0,42,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" is used, it consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" It does not appear to matter where ""zup"" is positioned within the sequence of words; it consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,42,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rules for the nonce word ""zup"":

1. The word ""zup"" itself consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
2. Other words in the input correspond to different colors: ""walm"" always results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" ""bluf"" results in ""green,"" ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""lug"" results in ""blue.""
3. The output seems to be a series of colors directly correlated with the input words, maintaining the same order.

From these observations, the rule can be formed:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: When ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,42,zup
Rule: The word 'zup' represents the color yellow.,1.0,42,zup

"Rule: zup translates to ""yellow"". Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to an output of ""yellow"".",1.0,42,zup
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples, it appears that the ""bluf"" token translates to a repeated color word derived from the previous word or phrase. For instance, ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue,"" with ""bluf"" corresponding to ""blue"" repeated. Similarly, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" so here ""bluf"" repeats the color implied by the word ""wif."" Therefore, ""bluf"" repeats the color word immediately preceding it.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is the immediate previous color word repeated.",1.0,42,bluf
"Observing the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color that would be represented by the word just before it. Let's examine the pattern:

1. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue
The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"". Thus, ""bluf"" results in repeating ""blue"".

2. wif bluf -> red red
The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"". Thus, ""bluf"" results in repeating ""red"".

3. zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green
Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". So ""bluf"" results in repeating ""green"".

4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"". So ""bluf"" results in repeating ""yellow"".

5. zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red
Here again, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"". So ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""red"".

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color represented by the word immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,42,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to be linked to the colors represented by the words that precede it. The color repetition and sequence in the output in relation to the presence of ""bluf"" in the input seem to indicate that ""bluf"" involves repeating the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. Let's break down the examples to identify the pattern:

1. Input: ""dax lug bluf"" -> Output: ""green blue blue""
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and in the output, ""blue"" is repeated twice after ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"".

2. Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red""
""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and in the output, ""red"" is repeated.

3. Input: ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> Output: ""yellow green green yellow green""
In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated, surrounded by ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"".

4. Input: ""zup bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow""
""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.

5. Input: ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow green yellow green red red""
""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated at the end after a sequence that alternates between ""yellow"" and ""green,"" corresponding to ""zup"" and ""dax"" respectively.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,42,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,42,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf appears to be an operation that duplicates the color associated with the word preceding it. Here is the analysis:

- When ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""green blue blue"". ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and produces two instances of ""blue"".
- When ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""zup dax"" (yellow green) is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow green green"" - again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and produces two instances of ""green"".
- When ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- In the example ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"", the output sequence ends with ""red red"" when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color associated with the word just before it and outputs that color twice. 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color associated with the preceding word and outputs that color twice.",0.8,42,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it looks like the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the previous color output an additional two times. The previous color before ""walm"" is mentioned in each example is red (""wif"" apparently signifies red), and after ""walm"", red is repeated two more times consistently.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color twice more.",1.0,42,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the provided examples, let us examine the correspondence between the input and the output in each example.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Here, ""wif"" coincides with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this example, we see that ""wif"" is still ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

By comparing the input with its associated output, again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Here, ""dax"" is paired with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

One more time, ""wif"" aligns with red and ""zup"" with yellow.

With these comparisons, the consistent pattern we observe is that whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the word that immediately precedes it has an associated color that repeats three times in the output before the next color appears. The consistency across all examples shows that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence to appear three times in the output.",1.0,42,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look at the consistent patterns before and after the nonce word ""walm"" in the input and their corresponding outputs.

In each input where ""walm"" is present, the output always includes three consecutive instances of ""red."" More specifically, ""walm"" always follows the word ""wif,"" and in every instance, the output for ""wif walm"" is ""red red red."" The word that comes after ""walm"" doesn't seem to affect the ""red red red"" output sequence. This sequence is unique to ""wif walm"" and does not occur with any other combination of words. Thus, ""walm"" seems to determine the output of ""red red red"" when it immediately follows ""wif.""

We can write the rule as follows:

Rule: When the input contains ""wif walm,"" the output sequence will include ""red red red."" The word ""walm"" on its own does not have a specific output value without the preceding word ""wif,"" as its effect is only observed when it follows ""wif.""

Therefore, based on the provided examples:

walm -> meaning: When following ""wif,"" it generates the output ""red red red.""",1.0,42,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
2. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   
3. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

By examining the patterns, we can observe the following:
- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output color is ""red.""
- The presence of ""walm"" seems to influence only one word in the output sequence with the color ""red.""
- The word ""walm"" does not seem to depend on its position in the sequence, as it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of where it appears.

Based on the information provided, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> red

This means that every instance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,42,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the commonalities in the input and corresponding output across all provided examples:

1. The output always contains a sequence of ""red"" whenever the input contains ""walm.""
2. The sequence of ""red"" appears to be directly proportional to the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input.
3. The word ""walm"" is followed by different words in each example and does not seem to have a dependency on the word that follows.

Given these observations, we can come up with the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it corresponds to a sequence of ""red"" in the output. The number of times ""red"" is repeated in the sequence correlates with the number of occurrences of ""walm"" in that segment of the input before other words that change the color appear (such as ""zup"" or ""lug""). 

Based on the above, we can state the rule as follows:

walm -> a sequence of the color red, repeated for as many times as ""walm"" appears consecutively in the input sequence.",0.9,42,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue.",1.0,43,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,43,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" is consistent across all examples:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example provided.",1.0,43,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,43,lug
"Analyzing the input and corresponding output, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" by looking for patterns or consistencies. Here are the observations:

1. In each example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
2. It appears that ""dax"" does not change meaning based on its position in the sequence.
3. The presence of ""dax"" in input is always translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of which words come before or after it.

Based on these observations, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,43,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can examine the output when ""dax"" appears in the input.

1. When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"":
    Input: wif dax lug walm
    Output: red green blue blue blue
    (""dax"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""green"")

2. When ""dax"" stands alone or starts the sequence:
    Input: dax walm
    Output: green green green
    (""dax"" is at the beginning and the output starts with ""green"")

3. When ""dax"" is between words:
    Input: lug dax walm wif
    Output: blue green green green red
    (""dax"" is between ""lug"" and ""walm,"" resulting in ""green"")

4. When ""dax"" is at the end of a sequence:
    Input: dax walm zup lug dax
    Output: green green green yellow blue green
    (""dax"" at the end follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""green"")

5. When ""dax"" appears after ""bluf"":
    Input: wif bluf dax walm
    Output: red red green green green
    (""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" and the output is ""green"")

In all instances, regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,43,dax
"Rule: ""dax"" translates to the word ""green"". Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.",1.0,43,dax
"From analyzing the input-output pairs provided, each word in the input seems to be translated to a color in the output. We can create an initial hypothesis for the meaning of each of the words other than ""dax"":

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue or green (requires clarification based on ""dax"" meaning)
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow

Now, by looking closely at how ""dax"" influences the output, we can try to deduce its rule. In each case where ""dax"" appears, the subsequent word's color changes from what it would be without ""dax"" preceding it.

For example, ""walm"" on its own would translate to ""blue,"" yet when preceded by ""dax,"" it becomes ""green."" 

Let's see if the same pattern applies to other words. In the first input, ""lug"" on its own stands for ""blue,"" but when it is preceded by ""dax"" in other inputs, ""lug"" does not change its color - it stays as ""blue."" Therefore, ""dax"" may not affect ""lug"" the same way it affects ""walm.""

None of the provided inputs have a standalone ""walm"" without ""dax"" before it or other contexts that change its color. Therefore, we will need to assume that normally ""walm"" means ""blue,"" but when it is immediately preceded by ""dax,"" it becomes ""green.""

So, combining these observations, the rule seems to be:
- ""dax"" changes the color represented by the word immediately following it to ""green"" if that word is ""walm.""

Rule: dax -> changes the following word to mean ""green"" if that word is ""walm"". If the word is not ""walm,"" the original color meaning of the word is retained.",0.8,43,dax
"Based on the given examples, each input word corresponds to a color in the output. 

- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""walm"" corresponds to green
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to red (as seen in the last example where it has the same output as ""wif"")

Every time the word ""dax"" is used, the following word's corresponding color is repeated one or more times. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be contingent on the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.

Thus, we can infer the following rule:
- ""dax"" -> triggers the repetition of the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence.

Rule: ""dax"" indicates that the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence should be repeated in the output, with the number of repetitions equal to the position of ""dax"" in the input list.",0.8,43,dax

"zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,43,zup

In all instances, the presence of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can infer the following:

zup -> yellow",1.0,43,zup

"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" is translated to the color ""yellow"" consistently in all the examples except where the word ""lug"" immediately follows it. When ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" is translated to ""blue."" There does not seem to be any other conditions affecting the translation of ""bluf."" 

The rule is as follows:

Rule: bluf means ""yellow"" unless it is followed by ""lug,"" in which case it means ""blue."" 

Therefore:

bluf -> ""yellow"" (default)
bluf followed by lug -> ""blue""",1.0,43,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll look at the occurrences of the word ""bluf"" in the input and the corresponding output:

- Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug / Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Input: zup bluf wif lug dax / Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm / Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Input: zup lug zup bluf lug / Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif / Output: yellow blue red green green red

It seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is not based on a single color but rather on the context of the surrounding words. Observe that when ""bluf"" is preceded by a certain word, the corresponding output color is always the same. From the given data:

- When preceded by ""lug,"" the word ""bluf"" results in the output ""blue.""
- When preceded by ""zup,"" the word ""bluf"" results in the output ""yellow.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" the word ""bluf"" results in the output ""red.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the word ""bluf"" results in the output ""green.""

There might be an additional rule that defines ""bluf"" based on its previous word not mentioned within the examples provided. For the examples given, however, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately preceding it, mapping to the following colors:
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Therefore, based on the provided data:

bluf -> meaning: Changes its color based on the preceding word according to the rule above.",1.0,43,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup,"" and to the color ""blue"" at all other times. Here are the rule inductions based on the examples given:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and maps to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and maps to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and maps to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"" and maps to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and maps to ""green.""

However, the fifth example contradicts the initial rule as ""bluf"" here follows ""dax"" and not ""zup,"" but still maps to ""green"" instead of ""blue.""

It appears there may be an inconsistency in the examples provided, or there could be an additional, unidentified rule that influences the meaning of ""bluf."" Based on the first four examples alone, the rule for ""bluf"" could be stated as:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""blue,"" except when it follows ""zup,"" then it means ""yellow.""

"bluf -> meaning. The meaning appears to be ""yellow"". Rule: If in the input sequence the word ""bluf"" immediately follows any color word, the output for ""bluf"" changes to that color word. If ""bluf"" follows a word that is not a color word, then its output is ""yellow"".",0.0,43,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll analyze the examples and correlate each instance of ""bluf"" to the corresponding output in the provided translations:

1. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
2. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" -> ""yellow yellow red blue green""
3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
4. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
5. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red""

In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" There are no examples where ""bluf"" corresponds to a different output, so we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",0.0,43,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" correlates with ""green."" Since the output is composed of color names, we can guess that each word in the input is translated into a specific color. Across all examples, whenever ""walm"" is present, the corresponding output is a sequence of ""green.""

Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output sequence includes three ""red"" preceding the ""green"" corresponding to ""walm.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" regardless of what it precedes, the output sequence includes multiple ""green,"" with the number of greens matching the position of ""walm"" in the output sequence.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it is preceded by one ""blue"" and followed by sequence of ""green.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output sequence includes two ""yellow"" preceding the ""green"" corresponding to ""walm.""

The rule for other words seems to be constant for each word, for example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" and ""zup"" lead to ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, when followed by ""walm"". 

Considering all the evidence, we can induce the following:

walm -> green. 

Rule: When ""walm"" is in an input sequence, the corresponding output is one or multiple instances of ""green,"" with the number correlating with the position of ""walm"" in the sequence (i.e., its position in the output seems to be the last color mentioned in a repeating sequence whose length is determined by where ""walm"" is situated).",1.0,43,walm
"Observing the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""walm"" is used, it can be noticed that the word ""walm"" consistently produces three instances of the color ""green"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or surrounding words, ""walm"" consistently yields ""green green green"".

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" denotes three consecutive instances of the color green in the output.",1.0,43,walm
"Analyzing the outputs corresponding to the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" in each input, we can determine that the word ""walm"" is always followed by a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Given this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, output the color associated with that word three times.",1.0,43,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns related to ""walm"" in each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

   Walm occurs twice here, each time followed by a sequence of ""red green.""

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

   The sequence follows ""dax"" and the output is all green.

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

   ""Walm"" is followed by a sequence of ""green green"" after ""dax.""

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

   Similarly to the previous examples, after ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" and continues to be ""green"" after ""walm.""

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

   Following ""zup,"" the output is all yellow.

Considering these patterns, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the preceding word(s) for three iterations. It's a repetition marker for the color of the word that comes before it. In the first example, it repeats the color sequence of ""wif walm dax,"" and in the others, it repeats the color of the single word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output of the preceding word(s) three times.",0.9,43,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of colors in each Input/Output pair:

Input: `wif walm dax zup wif lug walm`
Output: `red red red green yellow red blue blue blue`
- Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""red green yellow,"" and the sequence ""walm"" at the end produced ""blue blue blue.""

Input: `dax walm`
Output: `green green green`
- In this instance, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green green.""

Input: `lug wif dax walm zup`
Output: `blue red green green green yellow`
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green green green,"" just like the example above.

Input: `dax zup dax walm`
Output: `green yellow green green green`
- Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green green green.""

Input: `zup walm`
Output: `yellow yellow yellow`
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, its output color is dependent on the word that precedes it. Looking at the pattern:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- The example with ""wif walm"" (which happens twice) is inconclusive because other colors precede and follow ""walm,"" suggesting that perhaps the repetition and location could be a factor. However, when ""wif"" directly precedes ""walm,"" we do not have a direct single color output for ""walm"" to analyze.

Considering the above, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color output of the word that directly precedes it, in a triplet form.

Let's now phrase the rule as instructed:

walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" appears after a word, it results in a triplet of the color corresponding to the preceding word.",0.9,43,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,44,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.",1.0,44,lug
"Based on the patterns observed in the examples provided, each time the word ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. There does not seem to be any variation in the output related to the context of ""lug,"" meaning that it does not depend on factors such as its position within the input sequence or the words that come before or after it. Thus, the rule can be determined as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,44,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every instance it appears. Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples would be:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""",1.0,44,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all examples provided.",1.0,44,lug

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

The consistent pattern is that each nonce word translates to a specific color. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,44,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a relationship between the nonce word ""dax"" and the outputs. It seems that each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" which implies ""dax"" is ""green"" since ""lug"" is consistently ""blue"" based on other examples.
- ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green.""
- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue,"" and since we can infer from other examples that ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""bluf"" is also ""blue"", we can confirm that ""dax"" stands for ""green"".
- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" which is consistent with our understanding that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow,"" which once again shows that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""zup"" can be inferred to mean ""yellow"" based on this example.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,44,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following associations for each word presented:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Now, looking at the examples involving the word ""dax"":

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is in the output regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Given these observations, we can establish the following rule for ""dax"":

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the meaning can be inferred as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence or the surrounding words. Therefore, it can be deduced that:

wif -> red

Rule:
Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output will include the color ""red"" at the corresponding position.",1.0,44,wif
"Rule: zup -> Repeat previous word and color. 

Analyzing the examples, whenever the nonce word ""zup"" is used, the previous word is repeated, and the associated color for that word is also repeated. For example, in ""wif walm zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" is associated with yellow and is immediately preceded by the word ""zup,"" resulting in ""walm"" (yellow) being repeated three times following the ""zup."" Similarly, in ""dax zup dax walm,"" the word ""dax"" is associated with green and is immediately preceded by the word ""zup,"" so ""dax"" (green) is repeated twice after ""zup."" The trend continues consistently across the examples, validating the rule.",1.0,44,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look at how the output changes with each occurrence of the word ""zup"" in the input. Let's examine each input and its respective output:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""zup"" is between ""walm"" and ""walm"" and the output shows an additional three yellows following the first red red red.

2. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and precedes another ""dax,"" resulting in a yellow between greens.

3. Input: dax zup dax zup
   Output: green yellow green yellow
   ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" and is followed by ""dax,"" and then ""zup"" comes again after ""dax,"" giving us a pattern of alternating green and yellow.

4. Input: lug zup dax wif
   Output: blue yellow green red
   ""zup"" is after ""lug"" and precedes ""dax,"" resulting in a yellow following the blue.

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Here, ""zup"" follows a sequence of ""lug walm"" and precedes ""lug,"" which leads to a yellow inserted into a sequence of blues.

Based on the examples, ""zup"" seems to act as a delimiter or a separator that always results in an output of ""yellow"" regardless of the words that come before or after it.

Rule: ""zup"" -> meaning. ""zup"" means yellow is inserted at the corresponding position in the output sequence.",1.0,44,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" dictates a change in the color word that follows it. To determine the meaning or the rule that ""zup"" follows, let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: ""wif walm zup walm""
   Output: ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
   
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow"". After ""zup"" the sequence of colors is repeated three times, indicating an amplification or repetition effect.

2. Input: ""dax zup dax walm""
   Output: ""green yellow green green green""
   
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow"". The ""zup"" in this instance appears to not be amplifying ""dax"" but rather introducing ""yellow"", followed by a continuation of ""green"" which ""dax"" represents. 

3. Input: ""dax zup dax zup""
   Output: ""green yellow green yellow""
   
   Similar to the previous example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after each ""zup"", there is a single ""yellow"". After ""zup"" there isn't a repetition of ""green"" but rather a pattern of alternation between ""green"" and ""yellow"".

4. Input: ""lug zup dax wif""
   Output: ""blue yellow green red""
   
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". The ""zup"" introduces a ""yellow"" again, suggesting that ""zup"" is followed by a single ""yellow"" irrespective of the word it precedes or follows.

5. Input: ""lug walm zup lug walm""
   Output: ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
   
   Once more ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow"". ""Zup"" again is followed by a single instance of ""yellow"".

Combining the information from all the inputs and outputs, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" -> meaning: When ""zup"" is encountered, it is followed by a single ""yellow"", irrespective of the preceding or following color word.

Output translation:
1. ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" (yellow), ""zup"" (introduces yellow), ""walm"" (yellow starting repetition).
2. ""dax"" (green), ""zup"" (introduces yellow), ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" (yellow).
3. ""dax"" (green), ""zup"" (introduces yellow), ""dax"" (green), ""zup"" (introduces yellow).
4. ""lug"" (blue), ""zup"" (introduces yellow), ""dax"" (green), ""wif"" (red).
5. ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" (blue), ""zup"" (introduces yellow), ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" (blue).

Thus, ""zup"" -> introduces a single instance of ""yellow"".",0.9,44,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to alter the color output associated with the word that directly follows it in the sequence. Each word has a default color: ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" is yellow. When ""zup"" precedes another word, the following changes are observed:

- ""wif walm zup walm"" yields ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" so when ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" it creates additional instances of the default color corresponding to ""walm"" (yellow).
- In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output is ""green yellow green green green."" This indicates that ""zup"" following ""dax"" resulted in a single additional instance of ""dax's"" color (green).
- ""dax zup dax zup"" produces ""green yellow green yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" following ""dax"" again results in a single yellow output, possibly indicating a pattern where ""zup"" generates one yellow output when placed between two occurrences of the same word.
- The sequence ""lug zup dax wif"" leads to ""blue yellow green red,"" where ""zup"" only produced a single yellow output. This reinforces the pattern observed where ""zup"" generates a single additional instance of yellow.
- Finally, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" showing that when ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" we don't observe an increase in the number of blue instances (but there's a single yellow instead).

Based on these observations, it seems that when ""zup"" is used, it outputs one instance of yellow, regardless of the word that follows. However, the rule is not entirely consistent; it breaks the pattern in the last example, as no extra yellow is produced after ""zup."" Yet, in all cases, an extra yellow is inserted somewhere after the ""zup.""

Therefore, the most consistent rule derived from the given examples is:

Rule: zup -> Generates a single instance of the color yellow somewhere following its position in the sequence.",0.8,44,zup
"From the examples given, it appears that 'zup' adds a color sequence in relationship to a specific word that precedes it. Let's analyze the examples to determine the specific rules:

1. In the first example, the word 'walm' precedes 'zup' and is followed by three 'yellow'. This suggests that 'zup' might be a command to repeat 'walm's' output (red) with an additional color (yellow) for a number of times.

2. In the second example, 'dax' precedes 'zup' and is followed by one 'yellow' and then the original color (green) repeated twice. This indicates that 'zup' might repeat the previous color sequence but with the addition of 'yellow'.

3. The third example is similar to the second one, but with two instances of 'zup'. Each 'zup' follows 'dax' and adds a 'yellow' in the output plus the 'green' that represents 'dax'.

4. In the fourth example, 'lug' precedes 'zup' and is followed by 'yellow' and then 'green' (the color for 'dax'). This means that 'zup' triggers a 'yellow' to appear after 'lug's' original color (blue).

5. The fifth example has 'lug' and 'walm' flanking 'zup', with a sequence of 'blue' repeated on both sides and a 'yellow' appearing after each 'lug'. This could mean that 'zup' applies a 'yellow' after the color that precedes it, but does not interfere with a sequence if the same word repeats after 'zup'.

Given this analysis, it appears that 'zup' introduces one instance of 'yellow' following the first occurrence of the preceding word's associated color. If the same word appears after 'zup' the sequence isn't affected or interfered with, except for adding one 'yellow' in the sequence.

Rule: 'zup' -> Introduce one instance of 'yellow' following the first occurrence of the preceding word's associated color within the sequence. If the preceding word is repeated after 'zup', continue with the original color sequence of that word, adding one 'yellow' after its respective color once.",0.8,44,zup
"bluf -> duplicates the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When bluf follows a word, the output is two instances of the color that corresponds to the preceding word. For example, if ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" If ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""",1.0,44,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.

The color corresponding to specific words seems to be consistent:

- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""

- ""lug"" results in ""blue""

When ""bluf"" follows these words, the output is the color corresponding to that word, repeated. Therefore:

bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes before ""bluf"".",1.0,44,bluf
"To deduce the rule behind ""bluf,"" I'll look at the patterns preceding the nonce word and compare them with the color outputs.

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color is ""green green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by additional words before ""bluf,"" the sequence leads to extra colors before the ""red red"". For example: 
  - ""dax walm wif bluf"" produced ""green green green red red""
  - ""dax lug wif bluf"" produced ""green blue red red""
- ""Zup"" before ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow""
- And a sequence with ""wif"" and then ""lug"" before ""zup"" and ""bluf"" produces ""red blue yellow yellow.""

It seems that ""bluf"" at the very least corresponds to a double repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it. Let's first determine the individual colors associated with the words: 

- Dax -> green
- Walm -> no individual output but may modify the sequence (not enough data to determine exact role)
- Wif -> red
- Zup -> yellow
- Lug -> blue (deduced from ""dax lug wif bluf"" and ""wif lug zup bluf"")

The structure seems to be that ""bluf"" doubles the color of the word just before it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word twice.

So, if we were to provide ""lug bluf"" as input, the expected output would likely be ""blue blue"" based on the rule identified.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The word before ""bluf"" determines the color, and ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated twice in the output.",0.9,44,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's focus on the outputs and how they relate to the inputs.

The input ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"". The only new information is ""bluf"" which corresponds to a double ""green"".

The input ""dax walm wif bluf"" leads to ""green green green red red"". ""Dax"" has been associated with ""green green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has added two reds at the end.

The input ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" is a new term compared to the first example, and since ""bluf"" seems to double the output associated with the preceding word, it looks like ""zup"" by itself would correspond to ""yellow"".

The input ""dax lug wif bluf"" leads to ""green blue red red"". Again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", ""lug"" might be associated with ""blue"", ""wif"" with ""red"", and ""bluf"" doubles the last color ""red"".

The input ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow"". ""Wif"" presumably corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" doubles the last color ""yellow"".

Based on these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it doubles the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. Hence:

bluf -> meaning: Doubles the color output of the preceding word.

Rule: If ""x"" is a word that translates to a certain color, then ""x bluf"" translates to that color repeated twice.",0.9,44,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" results in doubling the output color associated with the previous word. Here is the rule determined from the given input-output pairs:

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" ""dax"" produces ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""green,"" yielding ""green green.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also leads to another ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- When other color-associated words (""walm wif,"" ""lug wif,"" ""wif lug"") precede ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" doubles the color that the last word signifies; in the provided examples, ""wif"" stands for ""red,"" and ""lug"" stands for ""blue,"" with ""bluf"" duplicating the last mentioned color respectively.

Based on these observations, the rule could be formulated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Reduplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.",0.8,44,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. Input: lug walm zup -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
3. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
4. Input: lug dax walm -> Output: blue green green green
5. Input: dax walm lug -> Output: green green green blue

Now let's analyze:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""lug"" appears before ""walm"" and the output is blue, followed by more blues.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is the last word, and the output ends with greens, suggesting that ""walm"" may continue the color of the word before it.
- Example 4 has ""lug"" followed by ""dax"" before ""walm,"" and the output is blue, followed by greens, similar to the colors of ""lug"" and ""dax"" before they are repeated, so ""walm"" likely continues the pattern.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""lug,"" and the output has greens (matching ""dax"") followed by a blue (matching ""lug""), suggesting ""walm"" takes the color pattern of the word before it and continues it until the next word.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it until a new word introduces a different color.

Therefore:
walm -> repeats the preceding color.",0.9,44,walm
"Observing the patterns in the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the color output in a particular way. The output colors appear to be extending the color of the word that directly precedes ""walm"". Here’s how:

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". ""lug"" corresponds to a ""blue"" output, and ""walm"" seems to extend this by outputting two additional ""blue"".
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"". ""dax"" corresponds to a ""green"" output, and ""walm"" again extends this by two more ""green"".
- The pattern follows even when the order changes, as in ""dax walm lug"", the ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green green"" followed by the blue for ""lug"".

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it to occur twice more.

Therefore,

walm -> meaning. Rule: Duplicate the color output of the preceding word two more times.",0.8,44,walm
"Based on the examples provided, I will analyze the patterns and deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

1. When ""lug walm zup"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue yellow."" 
2. When ""wif bluf dax walm"" is input, the output is ""red red green green green.""
3. When ""lug walm"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue.""
4. When ""lug dax walm"" is input, the output is ""blue green green green.""
5. When ""dax walm lug"" is input, the output is ""green green green blue.""

By examining these patterns, here is what we can discern:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output (""blue""), followed by the output color corresponding to ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output (""green""), followed by the output corresponding to ""walm.""
- Context matters for ""walm"" because it seems to affect the word immediately before it.

So far, the rule we can infer is that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color output corresponding to the word before it three times, followed by a color that is constant for ""walm."" From the examples, ""walm"" alone does not have a singular, direct output that we can verify because it is always following another word. 

However, we see in the first and third examples that ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color green follows the three blues. And in the fourth and fifth examples, where ""lug"" and ""dax"" precede ""walm,"" a blue follows the three greens.

This leads me to make the following tentative rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the word immediately before it to repeat its associated color three times in the output sequence, with the final color being dependent on the preceding word (blue following greens, green following blues). If we say ""walm"" outputs green when following blue and outputs blue when following green, this is consistent with the examples given.

walm -> rule: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times followed by the opposite color (green for blue, blue for green).",0.8,44,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's review the patterns in the examples:

1. lug walm zup —> blue blue blue yellow
2. wif bluf dax walm —> red red green green green
3. lug walm —> blue blue blue
4. lug dax walm —> blue green green green
5. dax walm lug —> green green green blue

From the examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times before changing to another color.
- Whenever ""dax"" appears before ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times before changing to another color.
- When ""walm"" appears at the end of the sequence, the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated an additional time.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. However, ""walm"" also seems to set the number of repetitions to three.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

For example, in ""lug dax walm,"" the word ""dax"" is associated with green, and so ""green"" is repeated three times after it. Similarly, ""lug walm"" has ""lug"" before ""walm,"" and since ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""blue"" is repeated three times.",0.8,44,walm
"Rule: walm -> outputs a sequence of green followed by the color corresponding to the previous word. If there is no previous word, it defaults to blue.",0.0,44,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the context or presence of other words. The presence of other words ('dax', 'wif', 'walm') seems to map to different colors ('green', 'red', 'blue' respectively) that are separate from the word ""lug."" 

Rule: lug -> ""blue""",1.0,45,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue"", regardless of the other words present in the input. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". 

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,45,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output. Regardless of the other words present in the input or their order, ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,45,lug
"Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently produces the output ""blue,"" regardless of what other words it is paired with. Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" can be determined as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,45,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by surrounding words.",1.0,45,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word is associated with a specific color, and the color is repeated as many times as the word appears in the input. When considering the word ""dax,"" we see it always corresponds to the color ""green."" The number of times ""green"" appears is exactly the number of times ""dax"" appears in the input. This suggests that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green.""

Thus, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,45,dax
"Based on the examples given, we can induce that ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green."" Each time dax appears in the input, the color green appears in the output. It does not seem dependent on position or surrounding words since ""dax"" yields ""green"" whether it is at the beginning or in the middle of the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule induced from the examples provided is:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is encountered in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output.",1.0,45,dax
"Based on the provided examples, there seems to be a pattern correlating to the use of the nonce word ""dax"" and the output ""green."" When ""dax"" is presented, it appears to consistently correspond to the color green in the output, regardless of the context.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

dax -> ""green""

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is presented in the input, the color ""green"" is included in the output.",1.0,45,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule connecting the input word ""dax"" to the output. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Whenever ""dax"" is input, one of the output colors is consistently ""green."" This is observed in all provided examples.

2. The position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to change the fact that ""green"" is part of the output. This is based on various examples where ""dax"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence, but ""green"" still appears in the output.

3. Each other word in the input seems to correspond to a specific color in the output, independent of its position in the sequence. For example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the fourth input and ""green"" in the first input, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the third and fourth examples.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be that it corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Thus, the rule could be stated as: dax -> green.",0.9,45,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we must look for patterns in the provided examples. We need to compare the inputs that contain ""dax"" with their corresponding outputs, and try to see what role ""dax"" plays in relation to the other words and their outputs. Let's analyze the data:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
2. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
3. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""dax"" is mentioned, ""green"" appears in the output. Moreover, ""dax"" seems to contribute a single ""green"" to the output sequence regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Looking at example 4 more closely can provide additional insight:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- Since ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" in example 1, and the pattern is consistent in example 4, ""dax"" cannot also mean ""bluf.""

Furthermore, ""walm"" correlating with ""yellow"" in the input should yield more ""greens"" in the output if ""dax"" and ""walm"" were to mean the same thing, which they don't, as implied by the triple ""green"" output for ""dax walm"" in example 5.

From this analysis, it seems that ""dax"" does not translate to an exact color like the other words but introduces a ""green"" regardless of other colors being introduced. However, one conflicting piece is in example 2: ""lug dax"" yields ""blue green,"" but ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" might specifically translate to ""green"" and not just introduce it.

Considering these observations, the most consistent rule that fits the examples is:

Rule: dax -> green.",0.9,45,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

Analyzing the input and output pairs given, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.",1.0,45,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, it seems that ""wif"" might not only translate directly to ""red,"" given the various contexts in which it appears. Let's try to identify the pattern.

- In the first example, ""lug"" directly follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" stands alone at the end of the sequence, and the output is ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" follows ""wif"" twice and the output is ""red blue red."" There's also another ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" with the output being ""red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" follows ""wif"" with additional context (""zup"" afterwards), and the output is ""red blue yellow.""

It seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of the subsequent word. In all cases, when ""wif"" is mentioned, the output always includes ""red"" at the position corresponding to ""wif."" However, the presence of other words like ""lug"" and ""zup"" provides additional context, leading to their respective color translations (""blue"" and ""yellow""). It's possible that ""wif"" serves as a context-independent marker for ""red,"" which then allows for following words to be translated according to a set mapping.

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,45,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" To do this, we will compare the input and output pairs and look for patterns.

Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""wif"" precedes the word ""lug"" (Input: ""wif lug""), the output is ""red blue.""
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" (Input: ""wif bluf""), the output is ""red red.""
3. When ""wif"" appears at the end of a sequence (Input: ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif""), the output ends with ""red.""
4. When ""wif"" is between two words (Input: ""lug bluf wif lug""), the corresponding output is ""blue blue red blue.""
5. When ""wif"" appears in the beginning, followed by ""lug"" and then ""zup"" (Input: ""wif lug zup""), the output starts with ""red"" followed by ""blue"" and ends with ""yellow.""

The constant element here is that ""wif"" corresponds with the output ""red."" The word that follows ""wif"" seems to determine the next color in the sequence, with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red."" ""Zup"" does not precede or follow ""wif"" directly but is paired with ""yellow"" elsewhere.

Thus, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in output. The word immediately following ""wif"" determines the next color in the output sequence, with known mappings of ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" to ""red."" When ""wif"" stands alone or end a sequence, it simply corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore:
wif -> red",1.0,45,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,45,wif
"Rule: wif -> red. 

Based on the examples given, every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,45,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs carefully, considering the position of ""zup"" in the sequence and the corresponding output.

From the examples:
1. ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""
2. ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow.""
3. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
4. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red.""
5. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow.""

By inspecting the position and corresponding output where ""zup"" appears, it seems consistent that whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"" for that particular position, regardless of the order or other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,45,zup
"Given the examples provided where ""zup"" is present and the associated outputs, let's analyze the correlation between the input and the output:

1. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output always ends with ""yellow"".
2. The presence of ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" provides a consistent color output which does not seem to be impacted by the presence of ""zup""; ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
3. The output colors are consistent for other words despite different positions in the input list, signifying that the position of the word does not affect the color it represents.
4. The word ""bluf"" results in ""red"" when in conjunction with ""wif,"" and it results in ""yellow"" when combined with ""zup"" alone. This shows that ""bluf"" doesn’t have a consistent color output and might be affected by the context or nearby words. However, ""zup"" still leads to ""yellow"" even with the changing colors associated with ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: Regardless of the context or position in the input, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,45,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The rule here is that every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" Irrespective of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence or the words around it, the output consistently includes the word ""yellow"" at the position where ""zup"" is in the input.",1.0,45,zup
"Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output sequence. This is established by the consistent appearance of the word ""yellow"" each time the word ""zup"" occurs in the input. Each example results in a color or a sequence of colors being output, suggesting that other words in the input (such as ""walm"", ""wif"", ""dax"", ""bluf"", etc.) also correspond to specific colors.

Let's analyze the examples with their corresponding outputs to determine the rule for ""zup"":

1. Input: zup walm lug → Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
2. Input: dax walm wif zup → Output: green green green red yellow
3. Input: zup bluf → Output: yellow yellow
4. Input: zup wif bluf → Output: yellow red red
5. Input: wif walm dax zup → Output: red red red green yellow

From these examples, ""zup"" is always followed by the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. This suggests a direct mapping from the word ""zup"" to the color yellow. Thus:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,45,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

All the examples show that whenever the word ""zup"" is present, it consistently corresponds to the output of the color ""yellow.""",1.0,45,zup

- lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue red blue blue (bluf repeats the color of the second ""lug"")

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,45,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" acts as a duplicate of the color associated with the word that follows or precedes it. To verify this, let's examine each example:

- The output for ""bluf"" is also ""green,"" which matches ""dax""

Input: lug bluf wif
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red""
- The output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"" which corresponds with the color associated with ""lug"" immediately preceding it

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red""

"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" results in the output being a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

For example:
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" (green is the color for ""dax"", repeated).
- ""lug bluf wif"" results in ""blue blue red"" (blue is the color for ""lug"", repeated, followed by red for ""wif"").
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" (colors follow their respective words until ""lug bluf"" which repeats blue for ""lug"").
- ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" results in ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow"" (again, each ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it).
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" (red for ""wif"" repeated due to ""bluf"").

Therefore, the rule can be encapsulated as follows:

Hence, 

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,45,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The color must be repeated once for each occurrence of ""walm"" immediately following that word.

Let's analyze the examples to better understand the rule:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and since ""walm"" follows it, ""yellow"" is repeated once. Another ""walm"" entails one more repetition of ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the following ""walm"" means ""red"" is repeated twice more.

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is repeated two more times, for a total of three.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - Another ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and since ""walm"" follows it, ""green"" is repeated twice more.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is repeated two more times.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is succeeded by ""walm"", thus ""yellow"" is repeated two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word. Each ""walm"" results in one additional repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,45,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should first identify patterns in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs. We will analyze the consistency of the words and the colors they produce:

- The word ""dax"" appears to result consistently in the color ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" appears to result consistently in the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" appears to result in the color ""blue.""
- The word ""wif,"" when it appears, seems to consistently result in the color ""red.""

Now let's focus on the occurrences of the nonce word ""walm"" and the colors that follow it:

1. Input: ""dax zup walm wif walm"" gives us the output ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" In this sequence, the word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color ""yellow"" and then changes to ""red"" after the word ""wif."" The second ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""red.""

2. Input: ""zup walm dax"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Here ""walm"" is again followed by a repetition of ""yellow"" before changing to ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

3. Input: ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" gives ""blue green yellow green green green red."" In this sequence, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and is followed by a repetition of ""green"" before changing to ""red,"" which is the color for ""wif.""

4. Input: ""zup walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Here ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""yellow"" before changing to ""blue,"" which is the color for ""lug,"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""

5. Input: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" From this, we see that ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""yellow"" with no other color following since there are no more words.

Looking at these patterns, we can infer that ""walm"" indicates a sequence where the color corresponding to the previously mentioned word repeats until a new word with a corresponding color appears. When a new word (such as ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""lug"") follows ""walm,"" the color sequence changes accordingly. If no new word follows, the last color repeats.

Rule: walm -> a command to repeat the color of the previous word until a new color-word pair is encountered. If no new word follows, continue repeating the last color.",0.9,45,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns associated with its appearance in various contexts.

From the provided examples, the following observations can be made related to the word ""walm"":

1. After ""walm"" is used, the color ""yellow"" appears one more time before the next color changes.
2. ""walm"" causes a repetition of the ""yellow"" color, suggesting it could mean ""repeat the previous color"" or more specifically, ""repeat yellow."" 

Let's validate this with the given input-output pairs.

- Input: dax zup walm wif walm
  Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
  Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow. After the first ""walm,"" we see one additional yellow before changing to red. After ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, we have ""walm,"" which leads to two more reds.

- Input: zup walm dax
  Output: yellow yellow yellow green
  Analysis: ""zup"" leads to yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which results in two more yellow outputs before changing to green for ""dax.""

- Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
  Output: blue green yellow green green green red
  Analysis: ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, followed by ""zup"" as yellow. Another ""dax"" is green, then ""walm"" repeats the green once before the color changes to red for ""wif.""

- Input: zup walm lug wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
  Analysis: ""zup"" leads to yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow twice, ""lug"" changes to blue, and ""wif"" changes to red.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  Analysis: ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which leads to a repetition of yellow twice.

Given that ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) in every instance and that it always results in a repetition of yellow, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color yellow.",0.9,45,walm
"Analyzing the patterns between the inputs and outputs, the word ""walm"" seems to be related to producing a certain color in the output. Observing the examples and the associated outputs more closely:

- In every example, the presence of ""walm"" in the input is linked to the word ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""walm"" does not seem to affect the color that comes before it, which depends on the other words (e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"").
- After ""walm"" appears, every word, including repeated instances of ""walm"", results in ""red"" in the output until a different instruction (i.e., a different word) changes it.

Therefore, it appears that ""walm"" sets a state change where every subsequent word after its first appearance is translated to ""red"" until the sequence is ended or a different instruction is indicated.

Rule: walm -> sets the output color to red for every following word until changed by another instruction.",0.9,45,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us look at its occurrence in the examples and the corresponding output patterns.

1. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Here, 'walm' follows 'zup' and precedes 'wif,' which gives two yellows and then changes the pattern after 'wif' to red.

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   'Walm' follows 'zup' and precedes 'dax,' and the pattern is consistent with yellows after 'zup' and a green after 'dax.'

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   'Walm' is after the second 'dax' and before 'wif,' continuing the green pattern after 'dax' and changing the pattern to red after 'wif.'

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   Again, 'walm' is between 'zup' (which corresponds to yellow) and 'lug' (which corresponds to blue), but it maintains the yellow pattern before changing after 'lug.'

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   'Walm' follows 'zup,' maintaining the yellow pattern.

Based on these examples, the rule that can be inferred for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: 'walm' continues the color pattern of the preceding word until a word that changes the color pattern occurs.

In these examples, 'zup' is consistently associated with yellow, and 'walm' continues the yellow pattern until a different color word appears. If 'walm' is followed by 'wif,' the pattern changes to red. If it's followed by any other color-associated word, the pattern changes to that particular color. If 'walm' is at the end of the sequence, it continues the color of the preceding word.

So,

walm -> meaning: Continues the color pattern of the preceding word until the pattern changes due to another word.",0.8,45,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" seems to represent the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue",1.0,46,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,46,lug
"Based on the provided examples, lug seems to correspond directly to the color blue.

So the rule is:

lug -> blue",1.0,46,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each given example.",1.0,46,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,46,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following mappings of input words to output colors:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- bluf -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Each example starts or contains the word ""dax"" which consistently maps to the color ""green."" Given that the word ""dax"" appears to produce the same result regardless of its position in the sequence, we can conclude that ""dax"" is not context-dependent in these examples; rather, it uniquely maps to the color green each time it occurs.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,46,dax
"From the examples provided, it can be seen that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. Examine each case individually:

- ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green."" Both occurrences of ""dax"" correspond to ""green.""
- ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red."" Here again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue."" Here again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

This consistent pattern suggests that every time ""dax"" is mentioned, the word ""green"" appears. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,46,dax
"Through analyzing the examples, we can induce that each word has a corresponding color as output. Let's break down the examples:

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue green
2. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green
3. dax lug wif -> green blue red
4. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
5. dax zup -> green yellow

From these examples, it is apparent that each time the word 'dax' appears, the color 'green' is produced in the output. Other words consistently produce their own colors as well: 'lug' produces 'blue', 'wif' produces 'red', and 'zup' produces 'yellow'. The word 'bluf' in the second example seems to correlate with 'blue', likely due to its phonetic similarity to 'lug'. Given this consistent pattern, we can induce the meaning of the nonce word 'dax' based on its color association in the given examples.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,46,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" is produced in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,46,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax.""

- When ""lug"" is an input, the output is consistently ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is an input, the output is also ""blue,"" followed by a ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is an input, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" is an input, the output is ""red.""
- When ""zup"" is an input, the output is ""yellow.""

Now let's examine the occurrences of ""dax"" in the inputs and the associated outputs:

- In every input where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green.""
- The position of ""dax"" in the sentence does not seem to affect its corresponding color in the output.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,46,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. There is no indication from the examples that ""wif"" changes its meaning based on context; it always translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,46,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can determine the meaning of ""wif"" by examining its corresponding outputs:

1. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
2. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
3. zup wif zup dax -> yellow red yellow green
4. wif lug -> red blue
5. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue

We can see that each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is produced in the output. It does not seem to depend on any neighboring words or any word position, as it remains consistent regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,46,wif
"By looking at the examples provided, we can deduce the pattern in which the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a color in the output. In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

Therefore, we can conclude the rule as:
wif -> red

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,46,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce the following:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output will contain ""red"" in the corresponding position.",1.0,46,wif
"Examining the given examples systematically:

1. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
2. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
3. zup wif zup dax -> yellow red yellow green
4. wif lug -> red blue
5. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue

We can notice the following facts:
- Whenever 'wif' appears, it translates to 'red'.
- 'wif' does not appear to alter the translation of the words that follow or precede it.
- There are no examples given which show a variation in the translation of 'wif', it consistently translates to the same color regardless of positioning.

From these observations, we can deduce that 'wif' directly translates to the color 'red' irrespective of its position in the sequence. Therefore:

wif -> red.",1.0,46,wif

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the corresponding output.",1.0,46,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,46,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look closely at the examples provided:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
2. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
3. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
4. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
5. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

From the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- The word ""bluf"" seems to cause the word immediately preceding it to repeat its corresponding output color.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of ""dax's"" mapped color.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red blue,"" which suggests ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and again ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of ""wif's"" mapped color.
- Similarly, ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of ""lug's"" mapped color, which is ""blue.""

Considering this pattern, we can formulate the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf causes the color associated with the word that precedes it to be repeated in the output.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the previous word in the output sequence.",1.0,46,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word before it. Here, each word seems to correspond to a specific color: ""dax"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue. When ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the color associated with that word is repeated.

Hence, bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: If a word X has a color associated with it, ""X bluf"" results in that color being repeated.",1.0,46,bluf
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the pattern I see:

1. ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""
2. ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue,"" so ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue.""
3. ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" so ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""
4. ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" so ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow.""
5. ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" so ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,46,bluf
"Observing the examples provided, we can make the following associations:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- When ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""bluf"", the output changes to ""green yellow yellow"".
- When ""lug"" and ""dax"" are involved with ""bluf"" and other words, the output colors seem to correspond with the individual words, maintaining consistency with previous examples (e.g., ""lug"" still translates to ""blue"").

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated twice. However, the pattern breaks with the input ""dax zup bluf,"" where ""zup"" is introduced and the output color changes with ""zup"" affecting the output after ""dax"". The output color for ""zup"" is not directly indicated in the given examples, but considering the overall pattern, ""zup"" seems to change the output associated with ""dax"" to yellow.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it two times. If another word modifies the color output of the preceding word, as in ""zup"" altering the output of ""dax"", that new color is repeated instead. The color association remains consistent when other words are part of the sequence.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word twice, or the modified output color if influenced by another nondescript word.",0.9,46,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the context in which it appears and the corresponding output.

- Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
- Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
- Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
- Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
- Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Looking at these inputs and outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the next color to be repeated. For example, in ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is translated to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes the next output to also be ""green."" In ""wif bluf lug,"" ""wif"" converts to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" leads to a repeated ""red"" followed by ""lug,"" which converts to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.",0.8,46,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned three times.,1.0,46,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word 'walm' appears to trigger a repetition of the last color mentioned prior to it, extending for a total of four instances of that color. Each time 'walm' is encountered, the color that is immediately before it is repeated three more times in the output. 

For instance:

- In the first example, 'zup' precedes 'walm' and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'. Hence, 'walm' generates three more 'yellow' in the output.
- In the second example, 'lug' precedes 'walm' and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'. Therefore, 'walm' results in three more instances of 'blue' in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color three additional times.",1.0,46,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is related to repeating the color associated with the prior word a certain number of times. Analyzing the input-output pairs:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
3. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
5. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""

It is observed that after each occurrence of the word ""walm,"" the color prior to it is repeated three more times, making it appear four times in total consecutively.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding walm three times.

- In the third example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" includes ""dax walm,"" and the output is ""green green green"" after ""dax,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Note that ""zup"" appears at the beginning of every output sequence and always results in the output ""yellow"". When ""zup"" appears again after another series of words (as seen in the fourth example), it results in ""yellow"" being added to the sequence once more at that point.

- When 'wif' follows 'zup', the output changes to ""yellow red"".
- Regardless of how many times 'walm' follows 'wif', the output after ""yellow red"" consists of repetitions of ""red"".
- When 'zup' appears twice in the input, with other words in between, it starts and ends the output sequence with ""yellow"", and the words in between 'zup' determine the other colors in the sequence – 'lug' leads to ""blue"" and 'dax' leads to ""green"".
- When 'lug' follows 'zup', the output is ""yellow blue"".

From these observations, it seems clear that:

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"" but precedes ""lug"" which translates to blue.

The consistent pattern is that ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the same color as the word that comes directly before ""bluf"".",0.8,47,bluf
"Observing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Each example consists of a sequence of nonce words that map to a sequence of colors. By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can establish the meaning of ""bluf.""

In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by the color ""yellow."" In the second example, it appears twice, and both times, ""bluf"" maps to the color ""red."" In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" again. The fourth example has ""bluf"" mapping to the color ""yellow."" Finally, in the fifth example, where ""bluf"" appears once, it corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" does not map to a specific static color. However, it appears that ""bluf"" always takes on the color value that was directly previous to it in the sequence:

1. ""zup bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow""
2. ""wif bluf lug wif"" maps to ""red red blue red""
3. ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red""

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf.""",0.8,47,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern regarding the occurrences of ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors:

- Every instance of ""walm"" in the input results in multiple occurrences of a color in the output.
- The occurrences of ""walm"" appear to be associated with the color that directly precedes their set of output colors.
- The number of color repetitions correlates with the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.

Let us analyze the provided examples in detail:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Here, ""wif"" triggers a ""red"" output, and after ""walm"" we see ""red"" repeated twice more, for a total of three ""red"" instances.

2. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""lug"" triggers a ""blue"" output, and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated two more times. After ""zup"" we see a ""yellow"" output, and after the second ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" repeated two more times.

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Here, ""wif"" triggers a ""red"" output, ""dax"" triggers ""green,"" and ""lug"" triggers ""blue."" After ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated two more times.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Here, ""lug"" triggers a ""blue"" output. After ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated two more times, after ""zup"" we see ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug"" which triggers another ""blue."" After the final ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated two more times.

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Here, ""wif"" triggers a ""red"" output, and after ""walm"" ""red"" appears two more times.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated two additional times. If ""walm"" is repeated, this effect continues with each instance of ""walm"" creating two additional repetitions.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: causes the preceding color to be repeated two more times.",1.0,47,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern it produces in the outputs:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
3. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
4. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
5. wif walm -> red red red

In each output, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it:

1. ""wif"" produces red, ""walm"" following it also produces red, repeating it as many times as ""walm"" occurs.
2. ""lug"" produces blue, and ""walm"" following it produces additional blue outputs.
3. ""lug"" produces blue, and ""walm"" following it produces additional blue outputs.
4. ""lug"" produces blue, ""walm"" produces additional blue outputs, and despite another word in between, a second ""walm"" again produces additional blue outputs.
5. ""wif"" produces red, and ""walm"" following it produces additional red outputs.

Based on these observations, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color output of the word that directly precedes it. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" blue is repeated; if ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" red is repeated. Additionally, the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned is the number of repetitions of the preceding color.",1.0,47,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to its appearances:

- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, there is a sequence of reds or blues in the output. 
- The color red is associated with ""wif"" and ""walm"" in the first and last examples.
- The sequence of colors does not seem to depend on the position of ""walm"" within the input.
- The sequence of colors is repeated based on the occurrence of ""walm."" If ""walm"" appears twice, the sequence is longer.

Rule:
- ""walm"" seems to replicate the color corresponding to the previous word in the input. If the previous word is ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), ""walm"" results in red being repeated three times. If the previous word is ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue), ""walm"" results in blue being repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug"" (which have green and blue outputs, respectively), it only outputs two additional blues, possibly because ""dax"" itself is not followed by a color replication, and ""walm"" only amplifies the most recent color that involves replication (which would be the color corresponding to ""lug"").
- ""zup"" following ""walm"" breaks the sequence and introduces a new color, yellow.

walm -> Amplifies and repeats the color output of the most recent word that triggers a color repetition (three times if following ""wif,"" which outputs red; three times if following ""lug,"" which outputs blue). If it follows a non-replicating color word like ""dax,"" it repeats the previous replicating color (from ""lug"") twice.",0.9,47,walm
"Based on the examples, we can observe a pattern related to the occurrence of the nonce word ""walm"" and its corresponding output:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
3. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
4. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
5. wif walm -> red red red

In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" leading to a triple ""red"" in the output. In examples 2 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" or ""zup"" resulting in triple ""blue"" or double ""yellow,"" respectively. When ""walm"" appears at the end, as in example 3, it results in double ""blue."" Moreover, a single ""walm"" after ""wif"", as in example 5, yields triple ""red.""

The rule seems to point to ""walm"" being a multiplier for the color that corresponds to the word it follows. Specifically, the word before ""walm"" determines the color and ""walm"" results in repeating that color a certain number of times:

- After ""wif"", ""walm"" produces triple ""red.""
- After ""lug"", ""walm"" produces triple ""blue.""
- After ""zup"", ""walm"" produces double ""yellow.""
- If ""walm"" is the last word, it seems to double the last color mentioned.

Now, let's write it in the requested format:

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" depends on the preceding word and its position in the sequence. It repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word a certain number of times: triple after ""wif,"" triple after ""lug"" unless it is at the end of the sequence, where it doubles the last color mentioned, and double after ""zup.""",0.8,47,walm
"walm -> reduplicates the color of the preceding word in the sequence. Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears after another word, it causes the color associated with that previous word to be repeated that same number of times as the position of ""walm"". For example, ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and this is the second position, so ""blue"" is repeated twice after its initial occurrence.",0.0,47,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,48,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,48,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

"Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each subsequent word seems to correspond to a unique color as well. 

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". 
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". 
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". 
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" (which is the same as ""dax"").

Hence, we can deduce that ""dax"" -> green.",1.0,48,dax
"dax -> green

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" within the context provided.

In each example, when ""dax"" appears as input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. This consistent pairing suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Let's write this as a rule:

Rule: dax -> green

"dax -> green

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in all provided examples. Each subsequent unique word in the input appears to translate to a unique color. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" If a word is repeated, its color is repeated in the corresponding position in the output. ""Bluf"" is a new word in the context and happens to translate to ""green,"" which is the same color assigned to ""dax,"" but since there is only one instance of ""bluf,"" we cannot definitively conclude a pattern for it without more examples.",1.0,48,dax
"To understand the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

Input: wif lug zup
Output: red blue yellow

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

Looking through the examples given, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output. It is also observed that the ordering of translated colors matches the ordering of words in the inputs. Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" refers to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,48,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""red."" This inference can be drawn from the consistent appearance of ""red"" in the output whenever ""wif"" appears in the input.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,48,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,48,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- wif lug zup -> red blue yellow
- dax wif bluf -> green red red
- dax wif walm -> green red red red
- wif dax -> red green
- dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue

Analyzing these patterns, ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red."" It does not appear to change based on position or surrounding words. The remaining words, when translated, are consistent regardless of the presence of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,48,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each instance of a nonce word maps to a unique color. To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif lug zup - Output: red blue yellow

3. Input: dax wif walm - Output: green red red red
4. Input: wif dax - Output: red green
5. Input: dax bluf wif lug - Output: green green red blue

From example 1, we can see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which leaves ""wif"" to correspond to ""red.""

Examples 2 and 3 also show that whether ""wif"" is followed by one or two words (""bluf,"" ""walm""), it still maps to ""red."" 

Example 4 confirms that irrespective of whether ""wif"" comes before or after ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" it still maps to ""red.""

Example 5, ""wif"" follows ""dax bluf"" and the corresponding output colors are ""green green red,"" so ""wif"" once again corresponds to ""red"" when following the word ""bluf"" which here corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,48,wif

zup -> yellow.",1.0,48,zup
"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" appears to consistently translate to the color ""yellow"". No context is provided that suggests ""zup"" is dependent on position or other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,48,zup
"zup -> meaning. Rule: It appears that the word ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" is provided in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,48,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following relationships between the input and output:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif zup lug"" -> ""red yellow blue""
- ""wif lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow""

Looking at the outputs, it seems that whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output. This relationship is consistent across all examples provided, and ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"", regardless of its position within the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,48,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,48,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf

   We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" at the end corresponds to a doubling of ""red.""

2. wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Here ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red,"" while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Following this, ""bluf"" seems to double the color preceding it, turning ""blue"" into ""blue blue.""

3. wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   Following the rule, ""bluf"" doubles the ""red"" that precedes it, resulting in ""red red.""

4. lug bluf dax bluf

   Again ""bluf"" doubles the preceding color, turning ""blue"" into ""blue blue"" and ""green"" into ""green green.""

5. zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   ""Bluf"" doubles the preceding color ""yellow"" resulting in ""yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it. Thus, the meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the preceding color.",1.0,48,bluf
"Considering the repetitions of both the nonce word ""bluf"" and the corresponding outputs in the examples, we can see a pattern emerging that shows the word ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it.

Here's the pattern breakdown of the examples:
1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". ""Bluf"" is at the end, and the word before it, ""wif,"" translates to ""red"", so ""bluf"" here repeats the color ""red"" once, as indicated by ""red red"".
   
2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue"". The word before ""bluf"" here, ""lug"", translates to ""red"", but as ""walm"" also translates to ""red"", that doesn't disturb the pattern, so ""bluf"" still repeats the color ""red"" once, resulting in ""blue blue"".

3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" (which is ""red""), and the output is ""red red"", confirming the repetition.
   
4. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue green green"". ""Bluf"" comes after ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), with the output being ""blue blue"", and again after ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""), with the output being ""green green"".

5. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" comes after ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") and repeats the color ""yellow"".

From the given inputs and outputs, we can therefore induce that ""bluf"" stands for repetition of the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word immediately before it.",1.0,48,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. If the previous word is 'lug', 'bluf' translates to blue (lug -> blue, then bluf repeats blue). If the previous word is 'wif', 'bluf' translates to red (wif -> red, then bluf repeats red), and so on for other colors.",1.0,48,bluf
"Rule: The meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" depends on the position it appears in the sequence. When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" its output is blue. After ""wif"" or ""zup,"" the output is red. When it follows ""dax,"" the output is green. If it does not follow any of these words (as in the last example), the output is yellow. Therefore, it seems like ""bluf"" takes on a different color based on the preceding word's assigned color, but defaults to yellow when no specific condition is met.

bluf -> When following a word, ""bluf"" takes the color corresponding to the word it follows, otherwise, it defaults to ""yellow"".",1.0,48,bluf
"Considering the context provided by the input-output pairs, it looks like each word corresponds to a specific color. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look at the output after ""bluf"" appears in the input.

- After ""bluf"" in the first input, the colors are red red, implying that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red, but we also have occurrences of yellow following ""zup.""
- After ""bluf"" in the second input, it's followed by blue blue, which suggests that ""bluf"" might mean blue, but ""lug"" is also followed by blue in other cases.
- In the third input, after ""bluf,"" there's a single red, but ""wif"" also correlates with red elsewhere.
- However, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" does not lead to any consistent color output.

It seems that ""bluf"" is leading to different colors in different contexts, which does not allow us to pinpoint a single color that ""bluf"" could represent. Moreover, looking closely at the patterns, ""bluf"" appears to double the color that comes right after it:

- In the first example, bluf is followed by the sequence - red red.
- In the second example, bluf is followed by - blue blue.
- In the third example, the situation is less clear, but if we consider that ""bluf"" doubles the upcoming color, there's only one red to correspond with the ""wif"" that follows.
- In the fourth example, bluf is followed by - green green.
- In the fifth example, there's no following color, but the color yellow appears twice, which could imply ""bluf"" doubles the prior color if no color follows.

From these observations, it seems the rule might be that ""bluf"" doubles the next color or potentially the previous color if no color follows. However, the third input does not seem to perfectly fit this pattern, as there's only one ""red"" following ""bluf.""

Given this inconsistency and the fact that the third example does not perfectly align with the doubling rule, it would be reasonable to propose another interpretation:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that directly follows it; in case there is no word that follows, it repeats the color of the word preceding it.

Using this rule, we can explain all given examples, including the third input, by suggesting that in that case, ""bluf"" applies the rule to the preceding word ""wif,"" which is red.

Thus the rule can be phrased as:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the next word, or if there is no next word, repeats the color of the previous word.",0.8,48,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color associated with the previous word. To deduce this, observe the following:

- In the first example, the word following ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and the output color is green, repeated from ""dax walm.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" and the color is once again green, repeating the output color associated with ""dax.""
- In the third example, after ""walm,"" the color is red, which repeats the output color of the preceding word ""wif.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" continues the pattern of repeating the color of the previous word.

Based on this analysis, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,48,walm
"walm -> Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color output by the word immediately preceding it, up until either a new color is introduced or the series ends.",1.0,48,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to the repetition of the color previously mentioned. Here is the reasoning:

- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green,"" and the output after ""walm"" is also ""green,"" repeating the color that precedes it.
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), but the output associated with ""walm"" is ""green,"" which is again a repetition of the previous color, not the subsequent one. 
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""dax"" (green), with ""walm"" generating an output of ""red,"" again repeating the previous color.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the subsequent output for ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" consistent with the previous outputs where ""walm"" repeated the color beforehand.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" is repeated for ""yellow"" again after ""zup"" (yellow).

Using this pattern, the rule induction can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word's output.",1.0,48,walm
"To determine the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the correlation between the inputs and the outputs in the given examples:

1. In the first example, the occurrence of ""walm"" aligns with repeated ""green"" in the output.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug,"" both of which output ""green"" and ""blue"", respectively—the pattern holds, with ""walm"" producing ""green"" once more.
3. In the third example, the sequence of ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green."" Here, ""walm"" maintains the output color of the previous word (""wif"" -> ""red"") before changing with the subsequent word (""dax"" -> ""green"").
4. The fourth example shows that between two ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow""), ""walm"" produces ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup.""
5. In the last example, ""walm"" appears between ""zup"" (yielding ""yellow"") and ""lug"" (yielding ""blue"") and produces ""yellow,"" staying consistent with the color of ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can induce that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the output color of the immediately preceding word, except when ""dax"" follows, in which case it anticipates the ""green"" resulting from ""dax.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the output color of the preceding word, except before ""dax,"" where it produces ""green.""",0.8,48,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will analyze the input and output patterns provided in the examples. We are looking for consistent relationships between the input strings and the output colors.

For the first example:
Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
The color sequence includes ""blue green green green red.""

For the second example:
Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
The color sequence includes ""green green green blue.""

By examining these two examples, we can see that ""lug"" correlates to blue in the output when it appears first or last in the input. In the first example, ""wif"" correlates to red at the end of the input sequence. However, ""dax"" correlates to green when it appears before ""walm.""

Let's look at the third example:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Here, ""wif"" now correlates to red at the beginning of the sequence, and ""walm"" is followed by more red until ""dax,"" which correlates to green.

Now, the fourth example:
Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
In this example, ""zup"" correlates to yellow, and ""walm"" follows a ""zup"" and continues the color yellow.

The fifth example:
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Again ""zup"" correlates to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red at the end, and ""dax"" to green following ""wif"" or standing alone.

From the given patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it except when ""dax"" follows it, in which case ""walm"" has its own unique color—green.

Rule:

Now, looking at the appearances of ""dax"" and the corresponding output colors, we observe the following correlations:

Example 3:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Example 4:

Example 5:

4. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
5. ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green"" when occurring before ""zup"", ""bluf"", ""wif"", or another ""dax"". However, it translates to ""green"" in all occurrences.

So, based on these observations:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,49,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the relationship between the nonce word ""dax"" and its corresponding color output. Here is how ""dax"" is used in each:

2. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
3. zup lug wif dax lug -> yellow blue red green blue
4. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
5. dax zup dax zup wif -> green yellow green yellow red

By examining the outputs, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"". In each example, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,49,dax

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.",1.0,49,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the same position. There are no examples where ""wif"" translates to any other color or output.

- dax appears to correspond to the color green.
- bluf appears to correspond to the color yellow.
- zup, when it appears, it corresponds to the color yellow as well, and seems to precede the color associated with the next word.

Thus, we can infer the following rule:

zup -> meaning: The word zup translates to the color yellow.

- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" again corresponds to ""blue blue,"" further supporting the idea that ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" and since ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" remains consistent with ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""lug"" again is ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""blue"" two more times.
- In the third example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat twice. Then ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and the subsequent ""walm"" also causes ""red"" to repeat twice.

- When ""dax"" is the first word, it also translates to green (""dax walm wif"" -> green green green red).
- ""dax"" following ""wif"" again yields green (""wif dax zup"" -> red green yellow).
- ""dax"" remains green regardless of its position, as shown in ""dax lug walm"" resulting in green as the first output color (green blue blue blue).
- Even when ""dax"" appears as the second word without a third word, the output is green (""lug dax"" -> blue green).

Considering these observations, the consistent output associated with ""dax"" allows us to deduce its meaning.

2. In ""wif zup lug,"" where ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is followed by ""zup"" and ""lug"" which translate to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, the pattern holds.

3. The input ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" corresponds to ""green green red blue yellow,"" with ""wif"" once again translating to ""red.""

4. As for ""wif bluf,"" the translation ""red red"" reinforces that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" as ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" in previous examples.

5. Finally, ""dax zup dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow green yellow red,"" where ""wif"" is once again represented by ""red.""

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for a consistent pattern in the examples given. Let's break down each example and see if we can find a common rule that applies to all cases.

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

3. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" following a ""lug.""

4. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
   ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" giving us ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" again results in ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

Based on the above examples, we can discern a pattern: the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it. This rule applies consistently across all given examples.

"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that follows bluf. If there is no word following bluf, repeat the color of the last word before bluf.",0.8,50,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" results in a duplication of the color word that follows it in the input sequence. Here is the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" is followed by no word, it repeats the color word before it.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word ""lug"" (blue) to repeat.
- In the third example, ""lug bluf zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue yellow blue."" Again, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and results in a repetition of the color blue.
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup bluf"" becomes ""red green yellow yellow."" Notice that ""bluf"" occurs at the end after ""zup"" (yellow) and the output ends with ""yellow yellow,"" supporting the hypothesis that ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color.
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf zup"" maps to ""green green yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green green.""

Rule: bluf -> causes the duplication of the preceding color word's corresponding color in the output. If ""bluf"" is the last word, the last color mentioned before it should be repeated.",0.8,50,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes immediately after bluf.,0.0,50,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to represent a rule that repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. Here's the relationship broken down for each input:

   Analysis: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: lug walm

5. Input: wif walm lug bluf

Rule: walm -> when preceding a color word, repeat the corresponding color word three times.",1.0,50,walm
"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates that the color word preceding it should be repeated three times in the output. 

Examples to establish the rule:

- ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""zup"" means yellow, ""wif"" means red, ""dax"" means green, and since ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output for ""dax"" is repeated three times as ""green green green"".
- ""lug walm"" -> ""lug"" means blue, and ""walm"" follows it, thus ""blue"" is repeated thrice to give ""blue blue blue"".
- ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""lug"" means blue, ""zup"" means yellow, both followed by ""walm"", so each of their outputs is repeated three times, resulting in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""zup walm"" -> ""zup"" means yellow, and ""walm"" follows, so ""yellow"" gets repeated three times giving ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""wif"" means red, ""lug"" means blue, and ""walm"" follows ""wif"", so ""red"" is outputted three times followed by ""blue blue"" which represents ""lug bluf"".

Therefore, **walm** -> meaning: Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word three times.",1.0,50,walm
"From the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- ""zup wif dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green."" Since we know that ""zup"", ""wif"", and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow"", ""red"", and ""green"" respectively (assuming that each word corresponds to a single color and they are mentioned in order), the repetition of ""green"" three times indicates that ""walm"" might mean a repetition of the preceding color.

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue"", and again ""walm"" causes the color to be repeated three times.

- ""lug walm zup walm"" turns into ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which is consistent with the repetition rule for ""walm,"" as ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times and then ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated three times.

- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which aligns with the notion that ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated three times due to ""walm.""

- ""wif walm lug bluf"" results in ""red red red blue blue."" Here, ""wif"" is red and its color repeats three times due to ""walm,"" while ""lug"" is blue and ""bluf"" is an unknown that doesn't seem directly related to ""walm"".

- ""zup bluf"" means ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" means yellow, and ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color.
- ""wif bluf"" in ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red red"" because ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color (red) before it moves on to the next colors signified by ""lug"" and ""zup"".

- If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the meaning of the color word directly preceding it.

Here is the deduction process:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue."" ""Lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"", which makes ""bluf"" also ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and comes directly before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the meaning ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" hence, ""bluf"" takes on the meaning ""red"" in this instance.
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf dax lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue."" Here again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf lug"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" therefore, in this case, ""bluf"" means ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> takes the meaning of the color word directly preceding it in the sequence.",1.0,51,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word that immediately follows it.,0.8,51,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""blue"" repeated the number of times indicated by the word directly preceding ""bluf"" based on a specific color-coded rule.

Rule: The word that comes before ""bluf"" determines how many times the word ""blue"" is repeated in the output. Each preceding word corresponds to a number according to a color-coded system:

- ""lug"" means repeat ""blue"" once. (""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"")
- ""zup"" means repeat ""blue"" once. (""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"")
- ""wif"" means repeat ""blue"" once followed by the respective color translation once. (""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow"")

Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be tied to translation of the previous word to a color, followed by the word ""blue"" as many times as the translation indicates. Since ""wif"" turns into ""red red,"" it implies that ""wif"" translates to two repetitions. Similarly, ""lug"" and ""zup"" seem to translate to one repetition each. However, the third example doesn't perfectly fit this pattern unless the ""wif"" somehow indicates to repeat the subsequent translations one more time, which seems to be an exception to the rule or a sign of a more complex rule which we don't have enough examples to fully deduce.",0.6,51,bluf
"Walm -> meaning. Meaning: repetition of the previous color thrice.

Rule: The term ""walm"" means to repeat the color before it three times. For instance, if the color before ""walm"" is blue, then ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""",1.0,51,walm
"Based on the given examples and their outputs, we can observe the following patterns:

1. In every example where ""walm"" appears, the output is a sequence of the color ""yellow.""
2. The repetition of ""yellow"" in the output matches the position of ""walm"" in the input, such that for every occurrence of ""walm,"" three ""yellow"" colors are produced in a row.

Now, considering the pattern above, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> a sequence of three ""yellow"" colors.",1.0,51,walm
"Examining the provided examples and the respective outputs, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that is indicated by the word that directly precedes it. The number of repetitions is exactly three, regardless of the color it represents. Here is the breakdown of the rule application:

- In the first example, ""lug"" means blue, and ""walm"" follows it, leading to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, again we have ""lug"" before ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- The third example includes ""wif"" before ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red,"" and ""lug"" before ""walm,"" again resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- The fourth example presents ""wif"" before ""walm,"" leading to ""red red red.""
- And in the fifth example, ""zup"" means yellow, before ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Hence, the determined rule is that ""walm"" generates three consecutive instances of the color indicated by the preceding word. Therefore:

walm -> meaning: to repeat the color indicated by the previous word three times. Rule: when ""walm"" follows a color word, the output should be that color word's corresponding color repeated three times.",1.0,51,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should analyze the patterns and the resultant outputs in the given examples. Let's break down each example:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - In this example, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue."" The sequence ends with ""walm,"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - Here, ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also results in ""blue blue blue."" 

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - From previous examples, we know ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The sequence starts with ""wif,"" followed by ""walm"" which again results in ""red red red,"" suggesting a repetition of the previous color. The same occurs after ""lug,"" followed by ""walm,"" with a repetition of ""blue.""

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - Knowing ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" presumably to ""yellow"" (as it appears twice before ""wif""), we see ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" once more suggesting ""walm"" incites a repetition.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - Similar to the previous examples, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" we observe a repetition of ""yellow."" ""Lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" 

Rule:
From the examples, we can induce that the word ""walm"" when used after a color word (represented by another nonce word such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""wif""), it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous nonce word three times. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it outputs three ""yellow,"" following ""lug"" results in three ""blue,"" and following ""wif"" produces three ""red.""

Hence, the rule can be stated as:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous nonce word three times.

So:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color three times.",1.0,51,walm
"Walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For instance:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" means to repeat ""yellow"" three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" converts to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

So, the general rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word before it three times.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" correlates with the output ""blue."" Regardless of the other words surrounding ""lug,"" the presence of ""lug"" always ensures the inclusion of the word ""blue"" in the output sequence.

1. dax wif zup dax - green red yellow green
2. lug wif dax - blue red green
3. dax lug wif walm - green blue red red red
4. wif - red
5. lug wif bluf - blue red red

- In the second input (wif walm), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and after it, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color ""red.""
- In the third input (lug walm wif lug), ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""blue,"" ""wif"" introduces ""red,"" and the next ""lug"" returns to ""blue.""
- In the fourth input (lug walm zup lug zup wif), the pattern of corresponding colors continues: ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to a repetition of ""blue,"" ""zup"" introduces ""yellow,"" the next ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" the next ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" finally corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth input (wif walm dax zup), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" results in a continuation of ""red,"" ""dax"" changes it to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it two additional times. Here are the observed patterns:

- In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color blue, which is then repeated two more times after the word ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Here, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and after ""walm,"" red is repeated two more times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue."" The word ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" and blue is repeated two more times. Afterward, ""wif"" changes the color to red, followed by another ""lug"" returning the output to blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" The pattern is the same, with ""walm"" causing the color of the word before it, in this case blue, to repeat two more times.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" Once again, ""wif"" is the word before ""walm,"" so red is repeated two more times after ""walm.""

2. wif walm -> red red red
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". After ""wif"", the pattern includes the color corresponding to ""wif"" two more times.

3. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
Observation: The first ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" and the output continues with two more ""red.""

3. Input: lug walm wif lug

Observation: ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but after ""walm,"" instead of another ""blue"" for the next ""wif,"" we get ""red,"" and then the pattern resumes with ""lug"" leading to ""blue"" again.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   
Observation: ""Lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" usually leads to ""red."" After ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" just once instead of reacting to the subsequent ""zup,"" which usually leads to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Observation: ""Wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" we get an extra ""red"" before the normal pattern resumes with ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

Rule:
Based on the examples provided, after the term ""walm"" is introduced, the corresponding output color repeats the color for the nonce word immediately preceding ""walm,"" three times before resuming the regular pattern.

"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that follows it three times.

Analysis of examples:
1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue green blue blue blue"". Since ""dax"" means green and ""lug"" means blue, ""walm"" following ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

2. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"". Since ""wif"" means red, and the output is three reds, ""walm"" is causing ""red"" to be repeated three times.

3. ""lug walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue"". The ""walm"" after ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times, followed by ""wif"" which is red, and then ""lug"" which is blue.

4. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". The ""walm"" after ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times, then ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by the sequence of colors matching the remaining words.

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow"". The ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times, followed by green for ""dax"" and yellow for ""zup"".

"From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" when used after another word causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Each example begins with one or more words that correspond to a specific color, followed by ""walm,"" which leads to a repetition of the last color mentioned, three times.

Here’s the breakdown:

- In ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The last color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating repetition of the color ""yellow"" three times.
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" again means ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing repetition of ""yellow.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating repetition of ""blue.""
- In ""dax lug wif walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" showing repetition of ""red.""
- In ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The sequence ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" repeating the color ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif."" ""Lug"" after ""walm"" becomes ""blue,"" and ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,53,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to lead to a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it. For instance, when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the word ""red"" to be repeated three times. Similarly, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times as well.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it takes the color word directly before it and repeats its corresponding output color three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word's output three times.",1.0,53,walm
"From the given examples, walm appears to be associated with a repeating color output that matches the color of the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions and the color output itself seem to depend on the specific word that comes right before walm. Here's how it breaks down:

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm"", lug translates to blue, and zup to yellow. The output after walm is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is the color corresponding to zup repeated three times.
- In the ""zup walm"" example, we see ""yellow yellow yellow"" again, suggesting that walm is causing the word before it, zup (yellow), to repeat three times.
- ""Lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", so again, walm is triggering a threefold repetition of the color associated with lug, which is blue.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" once more a three-time repetition of the color linked to wif, red.
- Finally, in ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" walm repeats the color of wif (red) three times before moving on to the next words, lug and zup, which produce their respective colors, blue and yellow.

However, without additional examples or contexts, we can only draw a limited conclusion about ""wif.""

"To determine what the nonce word ""bluf"" means, let's analyze the input/output pairs provided.

1. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

Looking closely, we can see that the word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in the output's color:

1. In ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", and the color ""red"" is repeated.
2. In ""dax bluf"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", and the color ""green"" is repeated.
3. In ""dax zup bluf"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", and the color ""yellow"" is repeated.
4. In ""zup wif bluf"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", and the color ""red"" is repeated.
5. In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", and the color ""yellow"" is repeated; subsequently, ""bluf"" is succeeded by ""wif"", leading to a second ""red"" (no additional bluf is present but it appears the effects of bluf continue until a different non-color term is encountered).

Based on this pattern, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word that precedes it to repeat until a different non-color term is encountered.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to repeat until a different non-color word interrupts.",1.0,54,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to reflect the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the observed correspondence:

- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow red red green."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""wif"", which corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" is red in this instance.
  
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green."" Here ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", which corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" is green.

- ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow.

- ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""wif"", which corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" is red.

- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow.

Considering all the examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,54,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" represents a color that repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red. Therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is immediately after ""dax,"" which is green. Therefore, ""bluf"" is green as well.
- The third example is similar to the second, with ""bluf"" following ""zup"" (which is yellow), making ""bluf"" also yellow.
- In the fourth example again ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), hence ""bluf"" is red.
- The fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), so ""bluf"" is yellow as well.

Rule: bluf -> the color that corresponds with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"". If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is green. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is yellow. If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is red.",1.0,54,bluf
"Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow), so ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" ""Wif"" is red; hence ""walm"" doesn't relate to ""bluf"" but reinforces that ""wif"" is indeed red.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it mimics the color of the immediately preceding word, regardless of what that color is.",1.0,54,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word bluf appears to copy the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Exploring the input-output pairs:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output color is red, matching ""wif""'s associated color.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output color is yellow, which is the color for ""zup"".

"walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

- In the mixed example ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" we can see that ""zup"" has not been associated with a specific color in the previous examples, but following the pattern, we can infer that ""zup"" likely corresponds to ""yellow,"" because ""yellow green green green yellow red"" contains one yellow at the start and end, surrounding the known color associations for ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red).

1. ""zup wif walm"" gives us ""yellow red red red."" Since ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" the appearance of ""yellow"" correlates with ""zup,"" meaning that ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" when followed by ""wif"" and ""walm.""

2. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Again, ""wif"" always results in ""red."" We can assume that ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red,"" meaning that in this context, ""zup"" must only result in ""yellow.""

3. ""wif lug zup"" turns into ""red blue yellow,"" where ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" has previously been associated with ""blue."" The position of ""zup"" after ""lug"" still results in ""yellow.""

4. With ""wif zup,"" we get ""red yellow,"" which reaffirms that ""wif"" relates to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

5. In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the sequence yields ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow.""

The remaining ""yellow"" outputs occur for each instance of ""zup"" and ""walm"" in sequence.

Based on the repeated occurrence of ""yellow"" associated with the word ""zup,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that follow, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

1. Input: zup wif walm

   - ""wif"" maps to red once, and ""bluf"" maps to red once.
   
3. Input: wif lug zup

   - ""wif"" maps to red, ""lug"" maps to blue, and ""zup"" is at the end, resulting in yellow.
   
4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   
   - ""wif"" maps to red, and ""zup"" follows, resulting in yellow.
   
5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   - ""dax"" maps to green, ""wif"" maps to red, ""walm"" maps to red three times, ""lug"" maps to blue, ""zup"" precedes the repeat of ""walm"" which maps to yellow three times, the same count as ""walm"" maps to red.

It seems that ""zup"" on its own corresponds to the color yellow. When following repeatable words, it causes the next appearance of the repeated word to take on the associated color of that repeated word multiplied by the number of occurrences.

Rule: ""zup"" maps to the color yellow. If ""zup"" precedes a repeated word, it causes the next appearance of that word to be multiplied in its corresponding color by the number of times the word is repeated. 

Hence, the rule can be stated as follows:

zup -> Maps to the color yellow. Multiplies the subsequent repeated word's output color by its count of occurrences.",0.9,55,zup
"Rule: The word bluf translates to the color represented by the immediately preceding word. 

Explanation:

- In the first and third example where ""zup bluf"" is followed by either ""dax"" or no other word, the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that bluf takes on the color value of the word just before it—here, ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" which again shows that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- The second example is slightly more complex with the sequence ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" resulting in ""yellow yellow red blue green."" Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" while ""bluf,"" following ""zup,"" also translates to ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow green yellow green red red,"" where each word translates to a color except for ""bluf,"" which, following ""wif"" (red), results in ""red,"" consistent with the identified rule.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule mentioned above.

- The third example shows ""bluf"" following ""zup"" without other color indicators, and therefore ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" which is blue is followed by ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" is also blue.
- The fifth example illustrates ""bluf"" taking the color of ""wif"" which is red since ""wif"" is immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,55,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let`s look at each example and its corresponding output to find consistent patterns:

4. Input: wif dax zup walm

5. Input: zup wif walm

Analyzing the input and output pairs:

- In examples 1 and 3, the word ""walm"" is directly followed by output ""red red red"". This suggests that the word ""walm"" directly translates to three reds in a row.
- In example 2, ""wif walm"" appears twice and each time it is matched with ""red red red"", reinforcing the rule discovered from examples 1 and 3.
- In example 4 and example 5, when ""walm"" appears after ""wif"", in both cases it corresponds with ""red red red"". This again confirms our rule without contradiction.

Based on the consistent pattern across these examples, the rule can be inferred:

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to three consecutive ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: red red red",1.0,55,walm
"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" translates to the sequence ""red red red.""",1.0,55,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how the presence of the word ""walm"" and other words affect the output:

1. When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""
3. When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow.""
4. The color ""blue"" only appears when ""bluf"" or ""lug"" is in the input.

Now let's apply this to inputs containing ""walm"":

1. ""wif walm dax"" -> red red red green
   ""wif"" generates a ""red,"" ""dax"" at the end generates a ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to replicate the ""red"" color generated by ""wif.""

2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to additional ""reds."" It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color before it, as the first ""walm"" follows a ""yellow"" and results in more ""yellow,"" and the second ""walm"" follows a ""red"" and results in more ""reds.""

3. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> red red red blue blue
   Again, ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" after ""wif."" ""bluf"" and ""lug"" then each yield ""blue.""

4. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and generates additional ""yellows.""

5. ""zup wif walm"" -> yellow red red red
   ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats the ""red"" color.

From these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the color that was just outputted before ""walm."" If ""wif"" (red) is before ""walm,"" the output is additional ""reds."" If ""zup"" (yellow) is before ""walm,"" the output is additional ""yellows."" And if ""dax"" (green) is before ""walm,"" it was not observed, but we can infer based on the pattern that it would create additional ""greens.""

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the preceding color output.",1.0,55,walm
"The examples provided indicate that there is a consistent relationship between the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" and the color ""red"" produced in the output. Specifically, each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input results in three consecutive ""red"" in the output. We can confirm this by examining the length and pattern of the output relative to the input in each example:

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green,"" with ""wif"" producing one ""red,"" ""walm"" producing three ""red,"" and ""dax"" producing one ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" leads to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red yellow red red red."" Here, ""dax"" results in one ""green,"" ""zup"" results in one ""yellow,"" ""walm"" produces three ""red,"" ""wif"" produces one ""yellow,"" and the second ""walm"" again produces three ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" results in ""red red red blue blue,"" with ""wif"" producing one ""red,"" ""walm"" producing three ""red,"" ""lug"" producing one ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" producing one more ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" results in one ""red,"" ""dax"" results in one ""green,"" ""zup"" results in one ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" produces three ""yellow.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup"" leads to one ""yellow,"" ""wif"" results in one ""red,"" and ""walm"" produces three ""red.""

By examining patterns across all examples, we can determine the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to three consecutive ""red"" in the output.

Walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" triggers an output of three consecutive ""red.""",1.0,55,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll examine how the output changes with the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input. Looking at the pattern:

1. When ""wif walm"" appears, it is followed by a sequence of three reds.
2. When ""wif walm"" appears multiple times, each occurrence continues to be followed by a series of reds.
3. When ""wif"" appears without ""walm,"" it translates to a single red.
4. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" it is not immediately followed by red, but when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" it is.
5. Regardless of the position of ""walm"" (beginning, middle, end), it translates to reds when preceded directly by ""wif.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" is contextually related to producing red in the output. However, when paired with ""wif,"" (wif walm) the rule stipulates an output of three consecutive reds, suggesting that ""walm"" may enhance or repeat the effect of the preceding word when it occurs directly after ""wif."" When ""walm"" appears without being directly preceded by ""wif,"" the pattern is not directly clear from the available examples, as it could depend on the word just before it or the sequence of words.

Rule: When ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" the output is three reds. In other contexts, ""walm"" may not have a consistent direct translation but rather modifies or repeats the effect of the preceding word; more data is needed to define its function outside of the ""wif walm"" combination.",0.8,55,walm

Based on the repeated association of ""zup"" with ""yellow"" across different input examples, it can be concluded that ""zup"" refers to the color yellow. When ""zup"" is used in a sequence with other nonce words, those words correspond to different colors, but ""zup"" consistently corresponds to yellow.",1.0,56,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

Based on these examples, the word ""bluf"" always seems to result in the repetition of the color word that precedes it. To break it down further:

- In Example 1, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red.""
- In Example 3, which is identical to Example 1, we see the same pattern where ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red.""
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output again is a repetition of ""red.""
- In Example 4, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" and the output repeates ""yellow.""
- In Example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output repeats ""green.""

From this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" causes the immediate previous color word to be repeated in the output.",1.0,56,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the examples provided.

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

From 1 and 3, which are identical, we can see that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" must also translate to ""red"" since the input ""wif bluf"" yields the output ""red red.""

Looking at 2, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""wif"" again translates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Since ""bluf"" is the last token in the input and the corresponding output ends with ""red red,"" ""bluf"" must contribute an extra ""red"" as seen before.

In 4, the pattern holds with ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" again causing the output to end with a double occurrence of the color before it, which in this case is ""yellow.""

Finally, in 5, ""zup dax bluf"" gives us ""yellow green green,"" again showing that ""bluf"" causes the color preceding it to repeat.

From these examples, we can infer the following rule for ""bluf"":

bluf -> The rule for ""bluf"" is that it causes the color translated from the word just before it to be repeated.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word that translates to a color, the output is two instances of that color.",1.0,56,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs corresponds to ""red"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it.",1.0,56,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- The presence of ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- The presence of ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- The presence of ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

By comparing the sequences, the output appears to be a direct translation of each input word with one exception:

- When ""bluf"" appears by itself following ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup,"" the output repeats the color of the immediately preceding word (""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" without ""zup,"" the output repeats ""green"" (""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow"").

Every occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by a doubling of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it, except when ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif,"" in which case the output is ""red red,"" regardless of what comes before ""wif.""

Therefore, we can establish the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> Replicates the color of the word immediately before it, with the special case of producing ""red red"" when following ""wif."" 

In the given context:

- For ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- For ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> The ""bluf"" takes the color from the word ""zup,"" hence ""yellow,"" and doubles it.
- For ""zup dax bluf"" -> The ""bluf"" takes the color from the word ""dax,"" hence ""green,"" and doubles it.",0.9,56,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll look at each example provided and break down the patterns observed. Let's analyze the input and output pairs and see what we can infer:

1. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf | Output: yellow red green red red
3. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf | Output: green red green yellow yellow
5. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green

From these examples, we can identify the following patterns:

- Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is in the output at that position.
- Additionally, ""bluf"" tends to generate an extra ""red"" or duplicates its corresponding output, except for the first example where ""bluf"" appears alone without repetition.
- Other words like ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" have consistent translations: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Given the patterns found across the examples where ""bluf"" appears, it is likely that ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" and in some context, it may double that output.

Rule: bluf -> red (with potential duplication based on context, not fully determined by the given examples)",0.8,56,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we examine the context in which it occurs and the corresponding output:

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
2. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
3. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

In the first example, when ""walm"" is introduced, the color ""green"" is repeated.
In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and once again ""blue"" is repeated.
In the third example, ""walm"" is at the end, and the color ""yellow"" is repeated.
In the fourth and fifth examples, we see repetitions of ""yellow"" when ""walm"" is used after ""zup.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be:

walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word. 

Rule: If the preceding word has an associated color, ""walm"" causes the next output (or outputs if ""walm"" is the last word) to repeat that color.",1.0,56,walm
"walm -> green when preceded by ""dax"", -> yellow at the start of the sentence or when preceded by ""zup"". Rule:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"", the output color is ""green"".
- When ""walm"" is either at the beginning of the input sequence or preceded by ""zup"", the output color is ""yellow"".",1.0,56,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" changes the output color to match the color of the previous word in the sequence. Every time ""walm"" appears, it results in a repetition of the color associated with the word it follows. To sum up:

- ""lug dax walm wif"" -> blue green green green red
  ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green, associated with ""dax,"" is repeated.

- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
  ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color blue, associated with ""lug,"" is repeated.

- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
  ""walm"" follows the second ""zup,"" and the color yellow, associated with ""zup,"" is repeated.

- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
  ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and therefore the color yellow is repeated for ""walm"".

- ""zup walm wif"" -> yellow yellow yellow red
  ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and again the color yellow is repeated.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,56,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look for the patterns in the provided examples.

Example 1:
- Input: lug dax walm wif
- Output: blue green green green red

Example 2:
- Input: zup dax lug walm zup
- Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Example 3:
- Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
- Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Example 4:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

Example 5:
- Input: zup walm wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Looking at the examples where 'walm' is used, there is a discernible pattern:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after a color word (lug - blue, dax - green, zup - yellow, wif - red), the output repeats the color of the previous word until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.
- In Example 4, the only word preceding ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Thus the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In Example 5, after ""walm,"" a new color word ""wif"" appears which corresponds to ""red,"" thereby ending the repetition of ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color of the previous word until a new color instruction appears or the input ends.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,56,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input relative to the patterns in the output. Here's what we can observe:

1. In examples where ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the color green is in the output (first and second examples).
   
2. In examples where ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the color yellow is in the output (third and fourth examples).

3. When ""walm"" is immediately followed by ""wif,"" red appears in the output after the sequence of colors corresponding to ""walm"" (fifth example).

Now, let's consider the varying words that appear before ""walm"":

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green (from the output of examples where ""dax"" appears without ""walm"").
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue (from the same analysis).
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow (again, from the output of examples where ""zup"" is present without ""walm"").

From these observations, we can surmise that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output, but instead, causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word preceding it:

- When preceded by ""lug"" (blue), it results in a repeated output of green, except for the blue from ""lug"" itself.
- When preceded by ""zup"" (yellow), it results in a repeated output of yellow.

With these observations in mind, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

**Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat, until a different color word is encountered or the sequence ends. If ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, the preceding color repeats for the output of ""walm.""**

So:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: When used after a color word, ""walm"" causes the color related to the last color word to repeat until another color word appears or the sequence ends. If followed by ""wif"" (red), it maintains the repetition until ""wif"" changes the color to red.",0.9,56,walm

Based on the given examples, it appears that there is a mapping between nonce words and colors. Here is the analysis:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it consistently maps to ""yellow."" 
- ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" as well, which could mean ""zup"" and ""bluf"" have the same meaning or are contextually tied to the same color output.

There is no example given in which ""zup"" and ""bluf"" appear separately and map to different colors, so the rule can't be directly inferred that they are contextually dependent on each other for the color mapping.

Rule: bluf -> yellow",1.0,57,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Here's the breakdown of each example to show this:

1. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
   - ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" here
   - ""dax"" is associated with ""green""

2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   - Both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color ""yellow""

3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
   - ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
   - ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" is associated with ""green""

4. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
   - ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
   - ""walm"" could possibly be associated with another instance of the color ""blue""
   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the second instance of the color ""red""

5. lug bluf -> blue blue
   - ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""blue""

However, considering the fourth example, if ""walm"" is associated with ""blue,"" we have an inconsistency because ""bluf"" appears to take on the value ""red"" instead of ""yellow."" Since there is this irregularity, we could examine the rule whereby ""bluf"" takes the same color as the preceding word if there is one.

But, this pattern doesn't hold up in other examples where ""bluf"" follows different words yet consistently maps to ""yellow.""

After reviewing the examples again, focusing on the consistent mappings in the majority of examples, we conclude:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in these examples consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" except in the fourth example, which may contain an error or there is not enough information to understand why ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in this case.

bluf -> yellow",0.8,57,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow."" However, the context in which ""bluf"" is used within a sentence may impact the output and can lead to a repetition of the color that precedes ""bluf."" 

To further clarify this rule, let's examine the given examples:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" the output for ""wif bluf"" is ""red yellow,"" implying that ""bluf"" yields ""yellow,"" and the previous color is repeated once.
- When ""bluf"" stands alone after ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" again signaling that ""bluf"" yields ""yellow,"" and the previous color is repeated once.
- In the context ""lug zup bluf dax,"" where ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" the pattern of repeating the preceding color holds true, with ""bluf"" yielding ""yellow"" (""lug zup bluf"" gives ""blue yellow yellow"").
- The pattern is consistent when ""lug walm wif bluf"" leads to ""blue blue blue red red."" ""Walm,"" while not given a direct color output, seems to correspond to the same color as the preceding word in this case (""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue""), and ""bluf"" follows the same rule, yielding ""yellow"" and causing the preceding color (""wif"" which translates to ""red"") to be repeated.
- Finally, ""lug bluf"" giving ""blue blue"" confirms the rule where ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" while the preceding color is repeated once.

Rule:
bluf -> the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and when used in a sequence, the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated once before ""bluf"" is translated to ""yellow."" 

For example:
Input: lug bluf -> Output: ""blue"" (from ""lug"") ""blue"" (repeated because of ""bluf"") ""yellow"" (from ""bluf"")",0.8,57,bluf
"Considering the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is directly translating to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Let's verify this with the examples given:

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green

In this example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""yellow,"" while ""dax"" is ""green.""

2. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow

Here, both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green

In this scenario, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both translate to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red

In this input, ""lug"" and ""walm"" translate to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is also translating to ""red,"" following the word ""wif.""

5. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue

Both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""blue.""

From the last two examples, it seems there might be an exception to the initial rule when ""bluf"" directly follows certain colors (like blue and red represented by ""lug"" and ""wif""), it matches the color of the previous word instead of translating to yellow. So, while initially ""bluf"" seems to stand for ""yellow,"" it can also take on the color value of the word before if that word is a color.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning:
- If ""bluf"" follows a color word that represents blue or red, it takes on that color's value.
- In all other cases, ""bluf"" means yellow.",0.8,57,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. By examining the examples provided, one can infer that ""bluf"" translates to the word ""yellow."" 

Rule: Whenever the input contains ""bluf,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow.""",0.0,57,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word(s) three times.

In each example, the word ""walm"" causes the color denoted by the word that comes before it to be repeated thrice in the output.

Examples:
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""; ""lug"" stands for ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""; here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), and therefore ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""; ""zup"" stands for ""yellow,"" which is repeated three times after ""walm,"" and ""wif"" comes after and stands for ""red.""
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""; ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times, followed by ""wif"" (""red""), then ""dax"" again for ""green."" 

Therefore: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word(s) three times.",1.0,57,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules:

- The word preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.
- The color associated with the preceding word is what is repeated.
- The word ""walm"" by itself does not have an independent output but causes the preceding word's associated output to repeat thrice.

Given the examples:
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" which implies ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat thrice.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" continuing the previous implication.
- ""zup walm wif"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" suggesting ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and again, ""walm"" makes this repeat thrice before ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" further supporting the repetition caused by ""walm.""
- ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green,"" aligning with the same pattern where ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""walm"" causes the triple repeat, ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and a final ""dax"" gives another ""green.""

"walm -> repeated color of the preceding word.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's first establish the relationships between inputs and outputs by examining what color corresponds to each word based on all the given examples:

1. Each occurrence of ""dax"" results in ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" correlates with the color green.
2. ""wif"" has consistently resulted in red, indicating a correlation between ""wif"" and red.
3. ""walm"" has appeared twice, once resulting in green and once in red. Without further information, the rule for ""walm"" isn't clear since it corresponds to two different colors.
4. ""lug"" has been present once and resulted in blue, suggesting a possible correlation. However, without other examples with ""lug,"" we cannot be certain that it always corresponds to blue.
5. ""bluf"" resulted in yellow, but similar to ""lug,"" we can't be certain that it always corresponds to yellow without other examples.

With these relationships, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to a color command for each instance, represented by the color ""yellow."" 

Whenever ""zup"" is the only word in the input, the only color in the output is yellow. Following this pattern, the only consistent rule for other word-color pairs appears to be with ""dax"" and ""wif,"" which are green and red, respectively. Therefore, ""zup"" seems to be a standalone command that maps directly to yellow regardless of the surrounding context.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",0.9,58,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns based on the input and output pairs given:

1. ""zup lug bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue""
2. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
3. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""

- ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" multiple times and each output is ""blue blue.""
- ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
3. Input: lug zup

4. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm

- In the first example, ""zup"" transitions from the color red to yellow.
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes the color yellow before blue.
- In the third example, it comes right after ""lug"" and changes the output to yellow.
- In the fourth example, it appears between ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" transitioning to yellow twice.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" transitions from blue to yellow, before returning to blue again.

From this pattern, it appears that ""zup"" signifies a change in output color to yellow for just one instance. After the occurrence of ""zup,"" the color sequence continues with the color associated with the next word, if there is one. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> Triggers the output of yellow once immediately following its occurrence.",1.0,59,zup
"Rule: zup acts as a signal to switch the output color and repeat the same color for a count that corresponds to the number of times the preceding word appears before it.

Explanation:

1. In the first input ""dax walm wif walm zup"", the word ""walm"" appears twice before ""zup"". In the output, we see ""green green green"" for ""dax walm wif"" and then ""red red red"" after ""zup"". The switch from ""green"" to ""red"" suggests that ""zup"" changes the color, and the count of ""red"" corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" appears before the ""zup"".

2. In the second input ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", ""wif"" appears once before ""zup"", thus we have ""red yellow"" in the output, indicating that ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow"" and repeats once since ""wif"" appeared once.

3. In the third input ""lug zup"", ""lug"" appears once before ""zup"", and the output is ""blue yellow"", following the same logic.

4. In the fourth input ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", ""bluf"" appears twice before ""zup"" and hence the output is ""red red yellow yellow red"".

5. In the fifth input ""lug walm zup lug walm"", ""walm"" appears once before ""zup"" and hence the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"".

Based on these observations, we derive the rule that ""zup"" changes the current output color to the next color in the sequence and repeats that color for as many times as the preceding word appears before it.

Thus:
zup -> Signals a color change and repeats the new color as many times as the previous word appears before it.",1.0,59,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we should examine the patterns before and after ""zup"" in each example given and the corresponding outputs.

- In example 1, ""zup"" is followed by a pattern change: from ""red"" to ""yellow.""
- In example 2, after ""zup,"" the color pattern changes from ""red"" to ""yellow"" and then to ""blue.""
- In example 3, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""zup"" is followed by a set change: ""red"" to ""yellow"" and then the pattern resumes with ""red"" again.
- In example 5, after ""zup,"" there is a change from one ""yellow"" followed by repeating the sequence starting with ""blue.""

In all examples, ""zup"" is followed by a ""yellow."" After ""yellow,"" there is either a new color sequence or a continuation of the previous pattern. Thus, ""zup"" seems to indicate a shift in the pattern or color sequence, specifically marking a break with ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> introduces a change in the sequence, marked by a ""yellow"" output.",0.9,59,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's start by analyzing the pattern of the outputs in relation to the inputs where ""zup"" appears.

In all examples, it seems that ""zup"" triggers a repeating output of ""yellow"" followed by the previous word's corresponding color. 

For instance:
- In the first example, ""walm"" is brown, but after ""zup"", the output is ""red red red"" -> ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is blue, and ""lug"" is blue. After ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"" -> ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" is blue; after ""zup"" the output is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is blue, and ""zup"" switches to ""yellow yellow"" followed by the previous colors.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is blue, ""lug"" is blue, and after ""zup"", it is ""yellow"" followed by blue.

By reviewing these patterns, it appears that ""zup"" changes the output to a repeating ""yellow"" before resuming the color output for the previously stated word. Typically, it seems to result in two occurrences of ""yellow"" unless it is at the end of a sequence where only one ""yellow"" might appear.

Therefore the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""zup"" causes the output to become ""yellow"" for the next two outputs, or just one ""yellow"" if it appears at the end of a sequence. After that, the sequence resumes with the color corresponding to the word before ""zup.""

zup -> trigger two ""yellow"" outputs immediately after it appears, then resume previous word's color.",0.9,59,zup
"Rule: bluf -> corresponding color to the word preceding it. 

In the examples provided, ""bluf"" comes after a word that also has a corresponding color in the output. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color produced is red, which is the same color corresponding to ""wif."" When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color produced is blue, which is the color corresponding to ""lug."" Therefore, ""bluf"" means that the color to be output should be the same as the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,59,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, bluf appears to be associated with the color immediately preceding it. We can figure out what ""bluf"" means by looking at the pattern before and after the word ""bluf"" in every example:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output after ""bluf"" is ""red."" So here, bluf may mean ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output after ""bluf"" is ""green."" This supports the rule identified in the first example.
- The third example reinforces this rule as ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and results in ""green.""
- The fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output after ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" yet again supporting the rule.
- The fifth example also matches the rule, with ""lug"" (blue) being repeated as the output after ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,59,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> green

Based on the examples provided, it seems that every instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.",1.0,59,bluf
"In every example provided, when an instance of the word ""bluf"" appear in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" or ""green"" in the output, depending on the context of the surrounding words.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to the output ""red green red,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""zup"" to yellow, suggesting that ""bluf"" here corresponds to red.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" succeeds ""dax"" and the pair ""dax bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green green.""
- In the third example, it's the same situation as the second— ""bluf"" succeeds ""dax,"" corresponding to the output ""green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the ""lug bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue blue."" Here, we see for the first time ""bluf"" associated with blue, but we also notice it must be related to the presence of ""lug.""
- The fifth example also features ""lug bluf,"" which corresponds to ""blue blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When preceded by ""lug,"" the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" When it follows ""dax,"" it corresponds to ""green.""

Thus, ""bluf"" can mean either blue or green depending on whether it is preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax.""

Bluf -> The word ""bluf"" means ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"" and ""green"" when it follows ""dax"".",0.9,59,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color that comes after ""wif"" and before ""dax."" In each case, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, it is translated into the color that would follow if ""wif"" was replaced with ""bluf.""

Here are the examples for reference:

- In the first input, ""wif bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" just as ""wif"" on its own precedes ""red"" elsewhere in the sequence.
- In the second input, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the color following ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In the third input, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" consistent with the rule derived from the second input.
- In the fourth input, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" showing that ""bluf"" takes on the color following ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In the fifth input, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" again consistent with the color following ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Based on this pattern:

Rule: bluf -> the color that directly follows the previous color word in the sequence. For example, if ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" will result in ""red red,"" and if ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" then ""lug bluf"" will result in ""blue blue.""",0.8,59,bluf
"Walm -> Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times. 

For example:
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" stands for blue, so ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""dax walm lug"", ""dax"" stands for green, so ""walm"" leads to ""green green green"".",1.0,59,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that is associated with the previous word. When ""walm"" is mentioned once, the output color is repeated three times. When ""walm"" is mentioned twice in succession, as in the first example, the corresponding color is repeated six times (three times for each ""walm"").

Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", hence ""walm"" after ""lug"" gives ""blue blue blue"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and with ""walm"" after ""wif"", it gives ""red red red"".
  
- ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red"": Here again, the ""walm"" at the end generates ""red red red"" since the preceding word is ""wif"" which translates to ""red"".
  
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), leading to ""blue"" being repeated three times.
  
- ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue"": Following ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times. Then ""lug"" is followed by its respective color ""blue"".
  
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"": ""Walm"" after ""lug"" results in three ""blues"". The rest of the sequence follows a direct translation of words to their corresponding colors.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,59,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the pattern suggests that the word ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here is the evidence that supports this conclusion:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif,"" where ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""wif"" is associated with red. Each time ""walm"" appears, it produces additional occurrences of the color associated with the preceding word.

2. In the second input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and again results in additional occurrences of blue.

3. The third input has a standalone ""lug walm,"" causing a triplication of the color blue.

4. The fourth input shows ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" which then produces two additional greens before the sequence ends with ""lug,"" leading to a single blue.

5. In the fifth input, ""lug walm"" results in a triplication of blue, followed by a yellow associated with ""zup"" and then another blue associated with the subsequent ""lug,"" and finally, ""zup wif"" ends the sequence with a yellow followed by a red. The ""walm"" in this context only affects the preceding ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. If there's no word before ""walm"" or if the context is unclear, it might follow a default or different rule not observable from the given examples.

Hence:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Duplicate the associated color of the previous word three times.",0.9,59,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in repeating the color that was previously mentioned. Here's the pattern we can observe:

- In the first example, ""zup lug walm"" led to the output ""yellow blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" means repeat the last mentioned color, in this case, blue, two more times.
- In the second example, the sequence ""walm"" after ""lug wif zup wif"" results in ""red red red,"" implying that ""walm"" repeats the color red, that follows ""wif,"" three times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,” which is repeating the color blue two more times.
- The fourth example, ""dax walm lug,"" gives us ""green green green blue."" Here again, ""walm"" after ""dax"" repeats the color green two times before moving on to the next color associated with ""lug"" (blue).
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" It appears that ""walm"" repeated the last mentioned color, blue, once after ""lug."" However, it contradicts the earlier interpretation that ""walm"" should repeat the color two additional times.

Considering all the examples but accounting for the inconsistency in the last example, it seems that ""walm"" primarily suggests repetition of the last color but the number of repetitions may be inconsistent in the dataset. The typical pattern appears to be repeating the color two times after the original mention, with the exception in the last example.

Rule: walm -> repeat the last mentioned color. The number of repetitions may be two, but this is not consistent.",0.8,59,walm
"From the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it generates three blue outputs.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it generates three red outputs.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the third example does not provide data, but we can assume from the pattern that it might generate three yellow outputs, though this needs confirmation with more examples.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it generates three green outputs.
- ""Walm"" appears to repeat the color output associated with the preceding word thrice.

Given this pattern, the best general rule we can induce for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",0.8,59,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" is present, the output contains the word ""blue.""",1.0,60,lug
"lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,60,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,60,lug

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.",1.0,60,lug
"lug -> blue. The word 'lug' consistently translates to the color blue in all the given examples. 

Rule: lug means blue.",1.0,60,lug
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let us examine the inputs and corresponding outputs provided for patterns.

Looking at the examples:

- ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green."" Here, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and ""dax"" immediately follows with ""green.""
- ""zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green red."" ""zup"" is likely ""yellow,"" followed by ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and then ""wif"" as ""red.""
- ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green."" This example confirms that ""dax"" by itself means ""green.""
- ""dax lug zup dax"" shows ""green blue yellow green."" We can deduce that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" with ""dax"" flanking them as ""green.""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" with ""dax"" being ""green"" as before. The new word ""walm"" seems to also mean ""red.""

From the examples, it is clear that the consistent element is that ""dax"" always results in the word ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,60,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,60,dax
"dax -> green

Rule:
Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.",1.0,60,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the word ""dax"" and its associated output:

1. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   -> Here, ""dax"" follows ""wif"", which seems to correlate with ""red"". ""wif"" results in ""red"" and is followed by ""green"" from ""dax"".

2. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red
   -> ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   -> ""dax"" by itself results in ""green"".

4. Input: dax lug zup dax
   Output: green blue yellow green
   -> ""dax"" results in ""green"", ""lug"" in ""blue"", ""zup"" in ""yellow"", and the second ""dax"" again in ""green"".

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   -> ""wif"" results in ""red"", ""walm"" has the same output as ""wif"" which is ""red"", ""dax"" results in ""green"" and ""zup"" results in ""yellow"".

Based on the consistency of the output whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, irrespective of its position (start, middle, end), we can formulate the rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in every instance.",1.0,60,dax
"Rule: ""dax"" -> green.

Based on the given examples, every instance of the nonce word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".
  
- The second example ""zup dax wif"" has three elements that correspond to ""yellow green red"" respectively, confirming that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" here as well.

- The third example has only ""dax,"" and the output is solely ""green,"" which strongly supports the direct translation.

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug zup dax"" becomes ""green blue yellow green,"" where both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green.""

- Finally, the last example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow."" Here again, ""dax"" aligns with ""green.""

Therefore, ""dax"" -> green.",1.0,60,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. No matter the position of ""wif"" in the series of words, ""red"" consistently appears in the corresponding output string. Hence, we can deduce that ""wif"" means ""red"".",1.0,60,wif
"Looking at the presented examples, the word ""wif"" correlates consistently with the output ""red"".

Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: dax walm wif zup -> Output: green green green red yellow
Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green

The instances where other words are involved, each additional word corresponds to another color. The order of the words in the input matches the order of colors in the output. It seems that each word has a specific color associated with it. 

Given these examples, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be consistent:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,60,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" No matter the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence, the output always includes ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be independent of context, with ""wif"" directly mapping to ""red.""

wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,60,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,60,wif
"Based on the given inputs and corresponding outputs, we can identify a pattern that associates each word with a specific color. Notably, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" However, the other words seem to have their own consistent color associations as well. 

Here are the associations:

- ""wif"" always outputs ""red.""
- ""zup"" always outputs ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" and ""walm"" both seem to output ""green.""

Therefore, the rule we can extract is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,60,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given context.",1.0,60,zup
"Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding word in the output is ""yellow."" It does not depend on the position of the word ""zup"" in the sentence or the words around it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,60,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following individual word translations:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> blue (this word appears to be identical in meaning to lug)
- dax -> green

Since ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" across all examples regardless of position or surrounding words, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,60,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,60,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context. Thus, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,60,zup
"Rule: bluf -> blue

The rule can be deduced by observing the consistent replacement of the nonce word ""bluf"" with ""blue"" in the outputs. Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,60,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we should look for patterns in the input-output pairs. 

Observing the first example:
Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

- The word ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".
- The word ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"".
- The word ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".

Now, considering the word ""bluf"":
- In the presence of ""bluf"", the output is ""blue"" in the second position and ""yellow"" in the fifth position. 

Upon reviewing the second example:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

- The word ""dax"" correlates with ""green"".
- The word ""walm"" correlates with ""red"".

The position of ""bluf"" doesn't seem to influence its output directly; it is ""green"" after ""dax"" and ""red"" before ""walm"".

Continuing with the third example:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Again, ""bluf"" appears last and correlates with ""blue"".

In the fourth example:
Input: lug bluf zup lug
Output: blue blue yellow blue

""Bluf"" correlates with ""blue"" after ""lug"".

Lastly, in the fifth example:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and correlates with ""green"".

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that is immediately before it. If there is no word before it (as the first word in a sequence), it defaults to blue, as seen in the sole instance of this occurring.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the previous word in the sequence or defaults to blue if it is the first word.",1.0,60,bluf
"Given the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a particular color in the output. To deduce what the meaning of ""bluf"" is, let's examine the instances where it appears and the color it translates to:

1. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
In this example, each time ""bluf"" appears, it is translated to ""blue.""

2. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
Again, whenever ""bluf"" appears, the word ""green"" follows.

3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
Again, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue.""

4. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
Once more, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue.""

5. wif dax bluf -> red green green
In this string, ""bluf"" results in ""green.""

In all instances except the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" However, in the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" There seems to be an inconsistency here. If we assume there is a typo in the second input-output pair and that all instances should translate consistently, ""bluf"" would mean ""blue.""

However, if the second example isn't considered an error, we might need additional context or rules to explain the discrepancy. Without such context, we can only say:

Rule: bluf -> blue, with the exception of the second example where it corresponds to ""green."" This could be an anomaly or error in the dataset unless further context is provided.",0.8,60,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze its corresponding outputs across different inputs.

1. First Instance:
    Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
    Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

In this sequence, bluf corresponds to the color blue.

2. Second Instance:
    Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
    Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Here, bluf also corresponds to the color green.

3. Third Instance:
    Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
    Output: blue blue red blue blue

In this instance, bluf corresponds to blue again.

4. Fourth Instance:
    Input: lug bluf zup lug
    Output: blue blue yellow blue

Bluf corresponds to blue once more.

5. Fifth Instance:
    Input: wif dax bluf
    Output: red green green

Bluf corresponds to green here.

Based on these examples, ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color. Instead, it may alternate between blue and green, but without a clear pattern as to when each color is chosen.

However, a possible pattern could be that ""bluf"" is the color of the word that precedes it. For example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to blue, so ""bluf"" is blue in that context. Meanwhile, ""dax"" translates to green and when it precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is green.

Applying this logic:
- Whenever ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is blue.
- When ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is green.

Examining all instances following this possible rule confirms this pattern. Therefore, a likely deduction about the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: If the word before bluf is translated as ""blue,"" then bluf is also ""blue."" If the word before bluf is translated as ""green,"" then bluf is also ""green.""",0.8,60,bluf
"Reviewing the examples provided, the task is to identify the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by analyzing how it translates into the outputs. The outputs consist of color words, which seem to correspond to the nonce words in the input. By examining each instance, we can try to ascertain the rule that governs what ""bluf"" means.

- In the first example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" twice.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" twice.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" maps to ""red"" once.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" once.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" once.

Now let's look at what happens before and after the word ""bluf"" in each example:

1. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif""
   ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red""
   
   ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup"" in the first instance, the output is ""blue.""
   ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" in the second instance, the output is ""blue.""

2. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif""
   ""red red green green red red blue red""
   
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax"" in the first instance, the output is ""green.""
   ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" in the second instance, the output is ""green.""

3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf""
   ""blue blue red blue red blue""

   ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""red.""

4. ""lug bluf zup lug""
   ""blue blue yellow blue""

   ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" the output is ""blue.""

5. ""wif dax bluf""
   ""red green green""

   ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

Analyzing the position of ""bluf"" in each sequence:

- When ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" it seems to mean ""blue"" except once where the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" it translates twice to ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" it also means ""green.""

However, there is no clear-cut rule from these observations, as ""bluf"" corresponds to both ""blue"" and ""red"" after ""lug,"" inconsistent with each other. Additionally, ""bluf"" consistently means ""green"" after ""dax"" and ""wif,"" but this does not help to distinguish what ""bluf"" means throughout, as it does not always follow those words.

Given the inconsistencies and the lack of additional information or examples, it is challenging to derive a universal rule for ""bluf."" However, the closest pattern we can infer is that ""bluf"" may change its meaning depending on the word preceding it:

- ""bluf"" means ""green"" when it follows ""wif"" or ""dax.""
- ""bluf"" means ""blue"" when it follows ""lug,"" but there is an exception to this rule in the third example.

Without more data, we cannot determine a definitive rule. Therefore, based on the given examples, we have an incomplete rule:

Rule:
- ""bluf"" -> ""green"" when it follows ""wif"" or ""dax.""
- ""bluf"" -> ""blue"" when it follows ""lug,"" with at least one known exception where it might mean ""red.""",0.6,60,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word thrice.,1.0,60,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" results in the output word being repeated the number of times equal to the number preceding it. Each unique input word (lug, zup, wif, dax) corresponds to a color (blue, yellow, red, green), and the appearance of ""walm"" after any of these input words results in that color being repeated in the output.

Here's the breakdown of the rule application:
- In the first example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" we see that ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) and before that, ""lug"" appears twice without interruption. The output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which reflects three instances of yellow, even though ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and directly follows ""walm."" This implies that the repetition factor is affected by the word preceding ""walm"" and not the word following it.

- In the second example, ""zup walm"" simply results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" No other color word appears between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" which supports the repetition rule.

- The third and fourth examples reinforce this rule with ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red"" and another repeat of ""zup walm"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

- The final example ""zup lug walm wif dax"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" showing a repetition of the color corresponding to ""lug"" which is blue.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color word preceding it a number of times equal to the total number of instances that this preceding word appears in the input sequence before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm"" as many times as that word appears before ""walm"" in the input sequence.",1.0,60,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. The word ""walm"" does not have an intrinsic color value tied to it but rather copies the output value of the word before it. Each time ""walm"" occurred, the color associated with the preceding word was repeated three times.

Here are the instances that help confirm this pattern:
1. In the first example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and after ""walm"" we have ""blue blue blue"".
2. In the second and fourth examples, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and it is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. In the third example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and it is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red"".
4. In the fifth example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and it precedes ""walm,"" which results in ""blue blue blue""; then ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" which results in a single ""green"".

Hence, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is the following:

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,60,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that precedes it. Let's examine the examples to understand how ""walm"" is used:

1. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", repeating the color of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

2. zup walm
   Output -> yellow yellow yellow
   Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and again represents a repetition of ""yellow"".

3. wif walm
   Output -> red red red
   In this example, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", and the output is the repetition of ""red"".

4. zup walm
   Output -> yellow yellow yellow
   As in previous cases, following ""zup"", ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated.

5. zup lug walm wif dax
   Output -> yellow blue blue blue red green
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"" here, which has output ""blue"", and as a result, ""blue"" is repeated in the output until the next color ""red"" associated with ""wif"".

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color given for the word directly before it to be repeated until a new color word is provided.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color given for the preceding word until a new color is named.",1.0,60,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat previous color three times.

- In the first input example, ""lug"" directly precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color blue, and the output repeats blue three times.
- In the second and fourth input examples, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to yellow, which is repeated three times in the output.
- In the third input example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to red, which is then repeated three times in the output.
- In the last input example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to blue, which is repeated twice following ""walm"" before the sequence proceeds to ""wif"" which corresponds to red, followed by ""dax"" that corresponds to green. 

Thus, ""walm"" induces the repetition of the previous color mentioned three times.",1.0,60,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. This is consistent across all examples provided, as each instance of ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,61,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example.",1.0,61,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Here are the observations that support this conclusion:

- In every example where the word ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" also appears in the output.
- The word ""lug"" appears by itself in one input (""lug"") and the corresponding output is simply ""blue,"" which strongly indicates that ""lug"" represents the color ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is combined with other words (e.g., ""dax lug walm,"" ""zup lug dax,"" ""wif bluf lug""), the output always includes ""blue"" alongside the colors that likely correspond to those other words.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,61,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""

This can be supported by the following observations:
- When ""dax"" is used, which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is used multiple times, which corresponds to ""blue,"" ""lug"" still outputs ""blue"" in between these color assignments.
- Regardless of whether ""lug"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input, or even when it is the only word in the input, the output always includes ""blue.""
- The word ""lug"" appears with different surrounding words, yet it consistently results in ""blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" is not context-dependent within these examples.

Based on the examples provided, the rule for ""lug"" can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,61,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs provided with each input.",1.0,61,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" There are no additional context or patterns that suggest that ""dax"" changes meaning based on its position or surrounding words. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned, the output includes the color ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,61,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the given inputs and outputs to figure out the corresponding patterns. We need to find consistent rules that apply across all examples.

Observations:
1. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned, ""green"" appears in the output.
2. No other word consistently leads to the word ""green"" appearing in the output.

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,61,dax
"Rule: dax -> green. 

Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,61,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" consistently in the output, regardless of the context or the words that precede or follow it. Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds directly to the word ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,61,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns between the input and output strings while focusing on the position and occurrence of the word ""dax"" relative to others.

For each ""dax"" in the inputs, let's see what color it corresponds to in the outputs:

- In the first input, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green twice.
- In the second input, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green again, at the end of the sequence.
- In the third input, ""dax"" corresponds to green at the beginning of the string.
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" corresponds to green when it comes right after ""lug"".
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" corresponds to green when it comes right after ""wif"".

In all instances, the word ""dax"" corresponds with the color green, regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" represents the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,61,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,61,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that each word maps to a specific color. Breaking down the given examples:

1. ""dax wif walm"" maps to ""green red red red"". Therefore ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""walm"" corresponds to red. ""wif"" also corresponds to red since it appears more than once and always maps to red.

2. ""wif zup"" maps to ""red yellow"". Since ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" must correspond to yellow.

3. ""wif"" alone maps to ""red"", consistent with the previous examples where ""wif"" corresponds to red.

4. ""wif zup lug wif"" maps to ""red yellow blue red"". We already know ""wif"" translates to red and ""zup"" to yellow. Therefore, ""lug"" must correspond to blue.

5. ""zup wif"" maps to ""yellow red"". This is consistent with the meanings assigned to ""zup"" and ""wif"" as yellow and red, respectively.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,61,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems consistent across all instances:

""wif"" correlates to the output ""red"".

So, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,61,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" correlates directly to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned, the color ""red"" appears in the output. No other input dependent on context is provided that changes the output when ""wif"" is present.

"bluf -> blue followed by red. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to two colors in the output: ""blue"" followed by ""red"".",1.0,61,bluf
"After examining the provided examples, it is observable that the appearance of the nonce word ""bluf"" in the input is followed by certain colors in the output. Specifically, ""bluf"" is directly followed by the colors blue and red in every instance. There are no counter-examples to this pattern in the given data. Furthermore, no other input word corresponds with this particular sequence of blue and red in the output.

Therefore, based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> a sequence of the colors blue followed by red.",1.0,61,bluf
"From the provided examples, we can infer a correspondence between the nonce word ""bluf"" and a combination of colors in the output. Specifically, ""bluf"" seems to trigger two colors: blue and red.

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, followed by red.

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red
Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, followed by red.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red
Once more, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue followed by red. Since ""blue"" is represented by ""yellow red"", it seems like ""bluf"" causes a duplication of ""blue"" and is followed by an additional ""red"".

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
As above, ""bluf"" gives us blue (which is red here given the ""wif"" duplication factor) and then an additional ""red"".

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue
Finally, ""bluf"" again produces blue followed by another blue.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" is consistently associated with producing the output for ""blue"" twice before adding ""red"". 

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" followed by ""blue"" and then ""red"", noting that ""blue"" may be represented differently based on whether it's duplicated or not (e.g., ""yellow red"" for normal blue, ""red red"" for the doubled blue after ""wif"", which duplicates the preceding color).",1.0,61,bluf
"bluf -> blue followed by red. The color blue is immediately followed by the color red every time the word ""bluf"" is used in the input.",1.0,61,bluf
"Based on the patterns provided:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively when they occur before ""bluf"" but ""walm"" changes to ""red"" after ""bluf"" is present
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and seems to remain consistent regardless of its position relative to ""bluf""

It appears that ""bluf"" acts as a pivot point. Before ""bluf"", colors are mapped normally, yet after ""bluf"", the colors change. Specifically, ""walm"" changes from yellow to red. ""lug"" remains blue, but it is repeated as many times as ""bluf"" is stated. ""Bluf"" itself corresponds to a repeated color based on the last color word before it (excluding itself), which in this case is blue. This is why we see ""blue blue"" in the third, fourth, and fifth examples after ""bluf"" is introduced.

Rule: bluf -> the rule for ""bluf"" means to repeat the last colored word before it.",0.8,61,bluf
"From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. Let's examine the examples to confirm this:

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" yields ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow"", which is then repeated three times in the output.

2. ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and since it precedes ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

3. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"". Similar to the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", which is then repeated three times.

4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" yields ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", resulting in ""yellow"" being output three times.

5. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" yields ""yellow green green green yellow red"". Here ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green"", which is then repeated three times.

The presence of ""walm"" results in the preceding color being outputted three times. Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,61,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine the correlation between the input and the output in each example:

1. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Observation: ""walm"" seems to follow ""zup"" and results in three ""yellow"" outputs. Additionally, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" with these outputs matching outside the sequence influenced by ""walm"".

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Observation: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which in this instance corresponds to ""green"" and seems to cause a repetition of ""green"" three times.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Observation: Similar to the first observation, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces three ""yellow"" results.

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Observation: Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and gives three ""yellow"" outputs despite other colors appearing before it.

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   Observation: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in three ""green"" outputs, indicating that it's not just ""zup"" that affects the meaning of ""walm.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it, producing a triplet of that particular color in the output.

Walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.",1.0,61,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

- In the second example (""dax walm""), ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

"bluf -> red red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" always translates to ""red red"".",1.0,62,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

In the given input and output pairs, we have:

1. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> 
   yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

2. dax lug wif bluf -> 
   green blue red red

3. wif bluf dax walm ->
   red red green green green

4. dax zup lug zup bluf ->
   green yellow blue yellow yellow

5. zup bluf ->
   yellow yellow

Looking at the examples, each word in the input appears to correspond to a color in the output. Here's what we can surmise from the examples:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the color ""red"" follows it once or twice.

Specifically, we have:
- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by two ""red"" outputs.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is also followed by two ""red"" outputs.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by one ""red"" output.
- In example 4, there is no ""red"" following ""bluf,"" but ""bluf"" itself is translated as ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" and there is no ""red"" following it.

Upon closer examination, we notice that ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" twice only if another color (word) follows ""bluf"" in the input sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence or if it is followed by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" translates to just ""yellow"" and is not followed by ""red.""

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""bluf"" could be:
- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" unless it is followed by a different word that is not ""zup,"" in which case ""bluf"" translates to ""red red.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow if it is the last word or followed by ""zup""; otherwise, bluf -> red red.",0.8,62,bluf

   Output: yellow yellow
   
   ""Bluf"" is again followed by ""yellow yellow"", however, in this example, there is no previous instance of ""bluf"" to compare it with. But given the previous pattern, it's plausible that the output should have included ""red red"" as well.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"" in the output color sequence, regardless of what comes before it in the input.

Rule: bluf -> red red",0.8,62,bluf
Rule: bluf -> yellow,0.0,62,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in your examples. We will look for a pattern or rule that applies consistently to all instances of ""walm.""

Here are the examples you provided:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Now, let's analyze the output each time ""walm"" appears:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax"" and the corresponding output colors are ""yellow green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" once again and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" without any subsequent word and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""blue green blue.""

Based on the given examples, it seems that the appearance of ""walm"" consistently results in multiple instances of a color output, and each time it results in three instances of the color that corresponds to the word that comes before ""walm."" The following color correlations can be inferred from the non-""walm"" sequences:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""bluf"" -> blue
- ""lug"" -> blue

It follows that ""walm"" causes the output of three instances of the color that precedes it:

- After ""wif"" -> three reds
- After ""lug"" -> three blues
- When between ""zup"" and ""dax"" -> we see one yellow (from ""zup"") followed by three greens (presumably from ""walm"" relating to the color ""dax"" represents, green)

Given this analysis, we can conclude:

Rule: walm -> outputs three instances of the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

So based on the given examples:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is: when preceded by a color-indicating word, ""walm"" results in three consecutive instances of the color associated with that word.",1.0,62,walm
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can infer that the pattern involves the appearance of the word ""walm"" and how it is translated into a sequence of colors in the output. After examining each input and its output, it is clear that ""walm"" consistently results in the output ""red red red."" There are no instances where ""walm"" leads to a different sequence or set of colors.

Therefore, by induction, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: walm -> red red red

This means that whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it will be translated into the sequence ""red red red"" in the output.",1.0,62,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the Input/Output pairs for patterns related to the appearance of the word ""walm"":

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the presence of ""walm"" following ""wif"" leads to two additional ""red""s.

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". After ""zup"" and before ""dax"", ""walm"" appears, but given that ""wif"" follows after ""dax"" and corresponds to ""red"", it doesn't help in this instance.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red"", ""walm"" is followed by two more ""red""s, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"", which results in two more ""red""s.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" and ""lug"" are ""blue"", ""dax"" following ""walm"" is ""green"" like always, and ""lug"" is still ""blue"" at the end.

From these examples, we can observe that when ""walm"" follows ""wif"", ""walm"" results in two additional instances of the preceding color. It is not clear what happens if ""walm"" follows a color word other than ""wif"", as we do not have an example for that scenario. However, with the given information, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows the word ""wif"", it repeats the output color corresponding to ""wif"" two additional times.

Therefore:

walm -> Replicates the preceding color two more times when following the word ""wif"".",0.9,62,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" we should look at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs to identify a pattern.

From the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and generates a sequence of three reds.

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   
Here ""walm"" occurs between ""zup"" and ""dax"". We do not see the immediate repetition of a color, as in the previous example.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
Once again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in a triple red sequence.

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
Here the pattern is clear, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is red repeated thrice.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
We observe that ""walm"" comes after several colors and is followed by ""dax"" which is green. There are no three colors consecutively repeating right after ""walm"".

From these examples, we can see that when ""walm"" directly follows ""wif"", the output is three consecutive ""reds."" There seems not to be a specific pattern for ""walm"" when it does not directly follow ""wif"".

So based on the examples provided, one possible rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it translates to three consecutive ""reds"". Otherwise, its meaning is not demonstrated consistently in these examples. 

Therefore, ""walm"" -> three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word if the preceding word is ""wif"". If ""wif"" does not precede ""walm,"" the pattern is unclear with the given data.",0.8,62,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided:

- The word following ""walm"" never appears in the output.
- After the term ""walm,"" the sequence of colors always starts with triple ""red,"" regardless of the word that follows.
- It appears that the word ""walm"" itself does not directly correspond to a color but instead to a sequence of colors (specifically triple ""red"") followed by the color that corresponds to the next word in the sequence if there is one.

Rule: ""walm"" indicates that the next word's corresponding color should be omitted from the output and replaced by a sequence of three reds. If ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which normally corresponds to green, ""dax"" is not represented in the output, and instead, triple red is used. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or if there is no word following it, only the triple red appears, with no additional color following it.",0.8,62,walm

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,63,lug
"Given the examples provided, it seems that every instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of which other words it appears with. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

"Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.",1.0,63,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"". Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. It appears exactly once for every occurrence of ""dax,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,63,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax."" Here's what we can infer from the examples:

- In every output where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" always appears in the corresponding output.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not change the occurrence of ""green"" in the output.
- The number of times ""green"" appears corresponds to whether ""dax"" is accompanied by another word or not. For instance, when ""dax"" is preceded by ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

Given the consistency of ""green"" in the output whenever ""dax"" is present, we can conclude:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the outputs. Moreover, when ""dax"" is combined with ""walm,"" it generates a triple occurrence of ""green"" in the output. However, due to the limited number of examples, we cannot definitively determine if the triple occurrence is due to the combination of ""walm"" with ""dax"" or some other hidden rule that is not evident from the provided examples.",0.9,63,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Regardless of the context or surrounding words, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""wif"" means the color red.",1.0,63,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze each example and their outputs.

- When the input is a single ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" 
- When ""wif"" is combined with another word (e.g., ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm""), it appears to correspond to the color ""red"" in the output.

This is consistent across every example provided; hence, based on the data, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,63,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look at the patterns in which it is used and the corresponding outputs.

In every example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"":
- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: zup wif dax -> Output: yellow red green
- Input: lug wif lug -> Output: blue red blue
- Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red

It looks like ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input or the words around it. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""",1.0,63,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.",1.0,63,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we will examine the output of each example and the corresponding input.

- In the first two examples, the input ""wif"" alone yields the output ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red.""
- For the third example, ""zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow red green."" We can assume ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" given their placement around ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red blue."" The repetition of ""lug"" before and after ""wif"" and the corresponding ""blue"" before and after ""red"" in the output suggests ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- The fifth example, ""zup wif walm,"" leads to ""yellow red red red."" From earlier examples, we know ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and the output ""red red red"" following ""wif"" indicates ""walm"" consists of three parts, all translating to ""red.""

Based on the analysis, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" and is not context-dependent or changing based on its position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red",1.0,63,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes just before it.,1.0,63,bluf
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.,1.0,63,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately follows it. For instance:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" As a result, we see ""red red"" after ""wif bluf.""
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" hence the ""green green"" output.
- The fourth example only contains ""zup bluf"" with the output ""yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" repeats the same color.
- In the last example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" and then ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the following word.

"bluf -> repeats the previous color. Rule: When ""bluf"" is encountered, the color name that was used immediately before it is repeated in the output.",1.0,63,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,63,bluf
"Observing the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule for the word ""walm"". Here’s what we can see:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

By examining the patterns in the input and the corresponding output, it seems that ""walm"" has the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" represents repetition of the most recent color word in the output, with the number of repetitions being one plus the number of times the color word has already appeared in the output up to that point.

Let's test this rule against our examples:

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times (since ""yellow"" appeared once, so one plus one).

2. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times (since ""blue"" appeared once, so one plus one).

3. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times (since ""red"" appeared once, so one plus one).

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Here ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is ignored, and the second ""wif"" again is ""red"". Now, ""red"" has already appeared twice, so ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three more times (since ""red"" appeared twice, so two plus one).

5. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times (since ""blue"" appeared once, so one plus one).

Therefore, walm -> meaning: Walm represents the repetition of the most recent color with the number of repetitions equalling one plus the number of times that color has appeared before ""walm"" in the output.",1.0,63,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in each input-output pair:

1. **zup walm** => **yellow yellow yellow**
   - ""zup"" correlates with a single ""yellow"" in the output.

2. **wif lug walm** => **red blue blue blue**
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
   - There are three instances of ""blue"" in the output.

3. **lug wif walm** => **blue red red red**
   - When the order of ""lug"" and ""wif"" is switched, the corresponding colors switch places but the repetition pattern remains the same as before.

4. **dax wif zup bluf wif walm** => **green red yellow yellow red red red**
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""wif"" still correlates with ""red"", and now there are three instances of ""red"" in the output.
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and there are two instances of yellow in the output.
   - ""bluf"" does not seem to correlate with anything in the output (it might be a red herring or irrelevant to the pattern).

5. **dax lug walm** => **green blue blue blue**
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and there are three instances of ""blue"" in the output.

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that comes just before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,63,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word as many times as there are letters in that word:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, which is repeated three times because 'zup' has three letters)
2. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue (lug corresponds to blue, which is repeated four times because 'lug' has four letters)
3. lug wif walm -> blue red red red (wif corresponds to red, which is repeated three times because 'wif' has three letters)
4. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red (wif corresponds to red, which is repeated three times because 'wif' has three letters)
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue (lug corresponds to blue, which is repeated four times because 'lug' has four letters)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word based on the number of letters in that word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color determined by the last word in the sequence a number of times equal to the number of letters in that last word.",1.0,63,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. The number of repetitions equals the number of words before the word ""walm,"" counting only unique words (ignoring repeated words and ""walm"" itself). Here's how it works:

1. ""zup walm"" involves one unique color word before ""walm,"" thus ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
2. ""wif lug walm"" involves two unique color words before ""walm,"" so the color associated with the last word (""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"") is repeated four times.
3. ""lug wif walm"" is similar to the second line but begins with ""lug,"" hence ""red"" from ""wif"" is repeated four times.
4. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" has four unique color words before the second occurrence of ""wif"" and ""walm,"" resulting in the final color (""red"") being repeated seven times, equaling the total count of unique words before ""walm.""
5. ""dax lug walm"" shows ""lug"" as the last unique word before ""walm,"" and with only two unique color words before ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated four times.

Walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: Walm is a repeater. It takes the last color word mentioned before it and repeats that color the number of times equal to the number of unique words before ""walm.""",0.9,63,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first note the variation in the number of colors in the output relative to the nonce words preceding ""walm"" in the input:

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the colors associated with the previous words, except in tripled or quadrupled form. However, 'dax wif zup bluf wif walm' does not conform to this rule since 'bluf' is not represented at all and 'yellow' appears twice instead of once. Possibly, 'bluf' means to skip or remove the next color.

Here are the potential associations:
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> skip/no representation of the following word

Following these associations, ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the colors but also could involve some kind of modification to the previous sequence. Possibly, ""walm"" repeats the color pattern of the words that come before it, but modifies it by eliminating the color of the word that directly precedes ""walm"" and doubling or tripling the current sequence instead. 

The rule, however, does not perfectly explain the 'dax wif zup bluf wif walm' case, but it does seem to suggest that 'bluf' might cause the omission or alteration of the sequence. Given that the last color (red from 'wif') is repeated three times, it seems that 'bluf' doesn't remove but may indicate that the last color before 'walm' gets repeated thrice, moving from a default of repeating twice (as suggested by 'wif lug walm' and 'lug wif walm'). It's not clear how 'zup walm' resulting in three repetitions fits in, given only one example without corresponding rules.

Considering the ambiguity of 'bluf' and the limited examples, the best tentative rule might be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color pattern of the words that precede it, modifying the number of repetitions according to specific rules that potentially involve the interaction with the word ""bluf."" Without 'bluf', the word immediately before 'walm' has its associated color output repeated three times. If 'bluf' precedes 'walm', the very last color word (skipping the one right after 'bluf') is repeated three times. More examples would be required to refine this rule further.",0.7,63,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" as consistently shown in all examples. When ""lug"" is combined with ""wif,"" the output includes ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

- ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue"", where ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green"", where ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green""",1.0,64,lug

"Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: In each example, whenever the word dax is used, the output includes the color green. Regardless of the position of dax in the input sequence, it consistently corresponds to the color green in the output sequence. This suggests that the meaning of dax in this context is the color green.",1.0,64,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the rule behind the nonce word ""dax"" can be inferred as follows:

- When ""dax"" is on its own following ""zup,"" it retains the translation ""green.""
- When ""dax"" follows directly after ""walm,"" it translates to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" it also translates to ""green.""

It seems consistent that whenever ""dax"" is used, it translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of the word that precedes it. Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,64,dax
"Given the examples, it appears that the presence of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently results in the output of the word ""green."" Regardless of what other words are present or their order in the input, ""dax"" is always translated to ""green"" in the output.

- ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green,"" with ""dax"" represented by the last ""green.""
- ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green,"" with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" again.
- ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green,"" starting with ""green"" for ""dax.""
- ""lug dax zup"" produces ""blue green yellow,"" with ""green"" standing for ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule for translating ""dax"" seems to be consistent and not dependent on context or placement among other words.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Here's what we can note:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output at the equivalent position.
2. The word ""dax"" does not appear to change based on its position in the sentence (beginning, middle, end).
3. No other word in the inputs that appears with ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output.

1. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"".

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's focus on the instances where it is used:

1. zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
- Here, ""zup"" precedes two instances of ""bluf"" which we know correspond to ""red."" Since the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and it replaces both instances of ""bluf,"" we can infer that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

4. zup lug -> yellow blue

5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- ""zup"" follows ""dax"" (green) and translates to ""yellow."" This also matches the pattern seen where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" (red) and the output is ""yellow.""

From all examples, it is consistent that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,64,zup
"From the given examples, we can deduce the following associations:

- zup corresponds to yellow
- wif corresponds to red
- dax corresponds to green
- lug corresponds to blue
- walm does not have a corresponding color but affects the following word as seen in example 4.

Now, examining the 'bluf' instances:

1. In the phrase ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" 'bluf' is followed by two 'red'. However, this rule does not hold for the second example.
2. In the phrase ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" 'bluf' comes after 'green' and is followed by another 'green.' This might suggest that 'bluf' repeats the color mentioned before it, but we need more evidence to confirm this rule.
3. In the phrase ""zup bluf,"" both 'zup' and 'bluf' correspond to 'yellow.' This supports the idea that 'bluf' repeats the preceding color.
4. In the phrase ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" 'bluf' is preceded by 'yellow' and produces 'yellow,' which consistent with the earlier observation about 'bluf.'
5. Finally, in ""lug bluf,"" both 'lug' and 'bluf' correspond to 'blue,' which fits the pattern we've observed so far.

Based on these observations, the rule for 'bluf' seems to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the preceding color.",1.0,64,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" results in the output color being the same as the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. Here is the breakdown of each line:

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" so the sequence ""wif dax"" means ""red green,"" and then ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word (in this case, ""dax,"" which is ""red"").

2. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" that comes right after ""dax"" also results in ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" 

3. Input: zup bluf
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" again results in the repetition of the color represented by the preceding word, thus ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   - The sequence is ""green red yellow yellow"" with ""bluf"" repeating the color of the word just before it, ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and then ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red.""

5. Input: lug bluf
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" once again yields ""blue,"" following the pattern.

So, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> The output color is the same as the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""",1.0,64,bluf
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the repetition of the color that was previously mentioned. Here is the rule derived from the examples:

- In the first input-output pair, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" results in another ""red.""
- In the second pair, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" so ""bluf"" repeats ""green.""
- The third example shows ""bluf"" immediately following ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"" (corresponding to ""yellow""), and thus it repeats the ""yellow"" output.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" outputs ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule would be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color that immediately precedes it.",1.0,64,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the output color for the word ""bluf"" is always the same as the color outputted just before it. That is, the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,64,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color that the word preceding it represents. This is apparent because every time ""bluf"" is used, it is followed by an output color that matches the color corresponding to the word directly before it. 

Let's check the pattern:

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" yields ""green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif"" yields ""yellow yellow red,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""wif"" (red). Here ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"" (the word before it), which is yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" again follows ""lug,"" and ""lug"" means blue.

Rule: bluf -> This word takes on the color meaning of the word directly before it.",1.0,64,bluf
"walm -> red

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to the color red regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.",1.0,64,walm
"From the given examples, we can derive the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by examining the commonalities in the outputs when ""walm"" is present.

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- After ""walm"" is introduced, the color sequence is ""blue"" (from the preceding ""lug"") followed by repeated ""blue"".

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- After ""walm"" is introduced, we see repeated ""red"" (from the preceding ""wif"").

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- The sequence ""wif lug zup"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow""
- After ""walm"" is introduced, the sequence is ""yellow yellow"" (repeating the ""yellow"" from the preceding ""zup"").

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- The sequence ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green""
- After ""walm"" is introduced, we see repeated ""green"" (from the preceding ""dax"").

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- The sequence ""zup bluf wif"" is ""yellow yellow red""
- After ""walm"" is introduced, we see repeated ""red"" (from the preceding ""wif"").

Based on these observations, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to repeat. In other words, for ""word1 walm ..."", the output is ""color1 color1 color1 ..."", with ""color1"" being the color associated with ""word1"".

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word before it to repeat.",1.0,64,walm
"To figure out the meaning of the word ""walm"", we need to analyze the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's compare each input with its output line by line to identify patterns.

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   
   In this line, the input ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". 

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The word ""walm"" corresponds to the remaining ""red(s)"". 

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

   Following the pattern from the previous examples, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". ""walm"" in this case is the sequence ""yellow yellow"".

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" is not in previous inputs but we can infer it corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Hence ""walm"" seems to represent ""green green"".

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

   By similar analysis, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is ""red"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" appears to represent ""red red"".

It seems like ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word immediately prior to it in the input sequence. Let's write this as a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"". If ""walm"" is the first word, no pattern can be discerned from the given examples.",0.8,64,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the outputs while focusing on the presence of ""walm"" in the input and the corresponding output. 

In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""red blue."" 

In the second example, ""walm"" immediately follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red.""

In the third example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow.""

In the fourth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green.""

In the fifth example, ""walm"" again is preceded by ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red.""

Following this pattern, it appears that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color that follows its preceding word:

- After ""wif"" = red (repeated twice)
- After ""lug"" = blue (no repetition due to end of pattern)
- After ""dax"" = green (repeated twice)
- After ""zup"" = yellow (repeated once)

However, there is an inconsistency regarding the number of repetitions of the color. In the first example, ""blue"" is not repeated after ""walm,"" which does not fit the pattern of repetition observed in the other examples. This might be due to the end of the pattern or some other unspecified rule.

Given this, a tentative rule for ""walm"" could be that it indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, but the number of repetitions seems conditional and is not entirely clear from the given examples.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color linked to the preceding word with the number of repetitions being conditionally determined.",0.7,64,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
2. dax wif walm -> green red red red
3. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

Since the word ""walm"" is in the input and the color red repeats consecutively in each corresponding part of the output, we can infer that ""walm"" implies a sequence of reds. Another aspect of the pattern is that the sequence of reds varies in length. By analyzing all examples, it appears the number of reds corresponds to the total number of other tokens present after ""walm.""

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by three tokens (zup lug zup), resulting in three reds in the output.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by no other token, and we also see only one red in the output.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by two tokens (wif lug), respectively giving us two subsequent reds in the output.
- In examples 4 and 5, ""walm"" is the last word, but not followed by any tokens, and still, there are two reds after ""walm"" both times. This suggests a rule deviating from the initial observation.

Let's test and refine the rule by considering ""walm"" signifies repeating red for the number of tokens that follow +1.

- In example 2 (""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""), ""walm"" is at the end, so it should add only one red, which is not the case (there are three reds).

Therefore, the revised hypothesis doesn't fully explain the occurrences of ""walm.""

On further inspection, ""walm"" directly follows different words across the examples, yet consistently three reds appear in the output sequence regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input. This indicates that the meaning of ""walm"" could be independent of the number of words that follow it, and instead, it consistently translates to three reds.

Let's revise the rule accordingly:
- ""walm"" consistently results in three reds in the output sequence.

However, this direct translation is contradicted by examples 1 and 3, where the sequence of reds following ""walm"" is different from three.

Based on this information, we can surmise the context influences the number of reds. Considering examples 4 and 5, both with ""walm"" at the end, the output shows two reds consistently, not consistent with any other apparent rule.

Given these observations, ""walm"" might mean an append operation of red color hosts based more on position and possibly other contextual factors yet to be fully determined.

Rule: walm -> results in at least one red in the output, with the exact number possibly being influenced by the position of ""walm"" in the input and other contextual factors.",0.3,64,walm

"Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""lug"" is consistent in each case. It always corresponds to the same output regardless of its position or the other words alongside it.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,65,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" acts as a color indicator within a sequence of non-related words that also map to colors. Each non-dax word appears to correspond to a different color, and ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green. To confirm this, we can analyze each line:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, again ""zup"" results in yellow.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" is repeated three times leading to three occurrences of yellow, indicating that one ""walm"" corresponds to one yellow. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue again.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green.
- ""dax"" leads to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue again.

Based on the pattern, each individual word translates directly to a specific color, and since ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, we can conclude that the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,65,dax
"Rule: dax -> green. 

Each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Other words in the input correspond to different colors, and ""dax"" consistently means green across all examples.",1.0,65,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" In each instance, the presence of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Additionally, it seems that other nonce words might correspond to other colors, and when they are repeated, the corresponding color is repeated the same number of times. Here's the relationship outlined:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the next color word several times (in this case, ""green"" for ""dax"")

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". This is consistent across all examples provided: whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,65,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the patterns before and after each occurrence of the word and compare them to their respective outputs:

1. dax lug dax wif dax -> green blue green red green
2. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
3. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
4. zup wif lug -> yellow red blue
5. lug wif -> blue red

The word ""wif"" appears between known words and colors. Notice when ""wif"" is introduced in the sequence, the following pattern changes color.

In the first example, ""dax"" is green both before and after, but there's a red between them where ""wif"" appears. Similarly, in the second example, ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and the color changes from blue to red. The third example is a bit more complex, with ""walm"" following ""wif,"" but we can see ""walm"" is red, and so is the color following ""wif."" In the fourth and fifth examples, ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and again we see a change in color from the previous to red, consistently.

Based on the above observations, ""wif"" appears to be an indicator for the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,65,wif
"wif -> meaning. Rule: Every time the word 'wif' appears, it translates to 'red'.",1.0,65,wif

"Based on the examples provided, we need to determine the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's break down the examples given:

1. ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in this scenario because ""wif"" is the preceding word and it translates as ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when following ""dax"" and when preceding ""lug"" it translates to ""yellow.""

3. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red."" Here, ""bluf"" again translates to ""green"" when following ""dax.""

4. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red,"" which further supports that ""bluf"" turns into ""red"" after ""wif.""

5. ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red,"" showing that ""bluf"" is ""blue"" after ""lug.""

From these observations, we infer the following rule that defines what ""bluf"" means based on the words that come before it:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it:
- After ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" means ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to a color. Examining the instances where ""bluf"" occurs, we can see that it doesn't always correspond to the same color in the output.

Let's look at each pair to infer the rules:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. lug bluf -> blue blue

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the color is red.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the color is green.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the color is blue.

Rule: bluf -> The color that bluf translates to depends on the preceding word. It takes the color corresponding to that word.

In order to decipher the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze its corresponding output in each example. 

In example 1, ""bluf"" produces the output ""red"" following the word ""wif"".

- ""bluf"" takes the colour of the word that precedes it.

Thus, we can conclude:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning is that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that it follows.

Rule: If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is red. If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is green. If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is blue. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is yellow.",1.0,65,bluf

   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   
4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Now, let's focus on the word ""walm"" and see which color is consistently associated with it in every output:

- In the 1st example, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"". ""zup"" is always yellow, ""dax"" is not mentioned in any other context, and ""walm"" follows a red and precedes a yellow in the output.

- In the 2nd example, ""walm"" follows and precedes ""lug"" which is blue, and the pattern around ""walm"" in the output is blue blue yellow.

- In the 3rd example, ""walm"" follows a blue and is followed by a yellow color in the output, and when it appears again, it's followed by reds which correspond to ""wif"".

- In the 4th example, ""walm"" follows a red and is followed by red(s) in the output.

- In the 5th example, again ""walm"" follows a red and is followed by red(s) in the output.

Considering the above observations, ""walm"" always corresponds to red in the output when we filter out the colors we can confidently assign to other words (such as ""lug"" = blue and ""zup"" = yellow). Therefore, based on these examples, ""walm"" represents the color red.

Rule: walm -> red.",1.0,65,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output in the following way:

- Every instance of the word ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- The word that follows ""walm"" determines what color comes after the series of ""red"" in the output, except when ""walm"" is the last word, in which case there are no more color outputs.

Let's apply this observation to each line:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""wif"" -> red, ""walm"" -> red, ""dax"" -> (after walm) green, ""zup"" -> yellow

2. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" -> red (but blue for the repeated ""lug""), ""zup"" -> (after walm) yellow, ""lug walm"" repeats the pattern with another set of blue and red for ""lug"" and ""walm"" respectively.

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red, repeated ""lug"" -> blue (sequence remains unchanged), ""walm"" -> red, ""zup"" -> (after walm) yellow, next ""walm"" -> red, and finally ""wif"" -> (after walm) yellow too, but followed by red since it's after ""walm"".

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""walm"" -> red

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""zup"" -> yellow, ""bluf"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""walm"" -> red

By analyzing the transitions and repeated patterns, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" denotes a change or continuation of the red output. Also, we can notice that the words before ""walm"" do not change their associated colors. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the output to be red, and the number of reds seems to depend on the context or possibly the position of ""walm"" in the input, influencing the subsequent color in a sequence. 

In a simplified form without considering more complex interactions and additional rules that might influence the output when there are multiple instances of ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> changes the output to red and influences the color following its own sequence.",0.9,65,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the correlation between the input and output sequences to deduce the meaning of ""walm."" 

The term ""walm"" appears to correlate with a sequence of ""red"" colors in the output, and the quantity of ""red"" varies depending on the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. Here's what we can infer from the given examples:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""wif,"" it is followed by three ""red"" colors in the output.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""zup,"" it is followed by two ""red"" colors in the output.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug wif lug,"" it is followed by just one ""red"" in the output.

To more accurately determine the pattern, we can pay attention to the words that come just before ""walm."" This is because the words ""wif"" and ""zup"" just before ""walm"" might be influencing the number of ""red"" outputs. However, given the examples, we do not have an instance where ""walm"" exists without a word before it that we can also find immediately before ""zup"" or ""wif"" in other contexts. 

Based on this limited information, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""red"" and the number of reds following ""walm"" is influenced by the word that precedes it—if ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" there are three reds; if ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" there are two reds; and if other words precede ""walm,"" there is one red.

Using the rule induction observations above, the meaning of ""walm"" would be:

walm -> meaning: ""red"" and the number of consecutive ""red"" colors in the output is determined by the preceding word according to the aforementioned rule.",0.8,65,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the color ""red"". Whenever ""walm"" appears in an input, the word ""red"" is included in the corresponding output.

Here is the observed correlation:

- Input: lug walm zup lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
- Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" translates to the repeated color before its occurrence.

Example 1: wif walm dax zup
Output is: red red red green yellow
""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""red"" two more times.

Example 2: lug walm zup lug walm
Output is: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""blue"" two more times, then ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" again for blue, and ""walm"" repeats blue three more times.

Example 3: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output is: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
Here, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red. ""lug"" appears again, then ""walm"" repeats the preceding color blue three times. ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow three times, and ""wif"" ends with red.

Example 4: zup wif walm
Output is: yellow red red red
""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" gives us red, and ""walm"" repeats red three times.

Example 5: zup bluf wif walm
Output is: yellow yellow red red red
""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" stays with yellow, ""wif"" changes it to red, and ""walm"" repeats red three times.

"Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is a sequence of colors that are the same as the color corresponding to the preceding word, followed by ""green.""
- When ""walm"" does not follow any word, the output is simply a repetition of the color corresponding to ""walm"" itself.

Let's break it down:

1. ""lug walm dax"" produces ""blue blue blue green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" we see that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" generates repeating ""blue"" before the ""green"" from ""dax.""

2. ""wif walm dax"" produces ""red red red green."" Similarly, ""wif"" must correspond to red and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" before the ""green.""

3. ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green."" When ""walm"" is after ""dax,"" it simply repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

4. ""zup dax walm"" produces ""yellow green green green."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to a triplet of ""green"" succeeding the initial color.

5. ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow."" Without any other context, ""walm"" replicates the color of the word it follows, which is ""yellow"" in this case.

Now, if we find the common behavior of ""walm,"" we can establish that ""walm"" replicates the color of the word before it, unless it’s followed by ""dax,"" after which it repeats the green corresponding to ""dax.""

"walm -> meaning. Meaning is that the word 'walm' takes on the color of the word preceding it, repeating three times, unless it follows 'dax', where it results in 'green'. Rule:

2. When 'walm' follows 'wif', the output is 'red' repeated three times because 'wif' can be inferred to mean 'red'.
3. When 'walm' follows 'dax', the output is 'green' repeated three times despite 'dax' meaning 'green' once. This indicates that 'walm' following 'dax' always turns to 'green'.
4. When 'walm' follows 'zup', the output is 'yellow' repeated three times because 'zup' can be inferred to mean 'yellow'. 

Consolidating these observations, 'walm' repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times, unless it is after 'dax', in which case the result is 'green' three times.",1.0,66,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""walm"" is related to repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the input.

Let's look at the examples:

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and immediately following ""lug"" is ""walm"", which results in repeating the same color for the output that ""lug"" represents (blue). Finally, ""dax"" is green.

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and immediately following ""wif"" is ""walm"", leading to repeating the color red that ""wif"" represents. ""dax"" is green.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, immediately followed by ""walm"", causing the color green to be repeated.

4. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, but it is not followed by ""walm"". The word ""dax"" corresponds to green and is followed by ""walm"", which leads to the repetition of the color green.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and is directly followed by ""walm"", causing a repetition of the color yellow.

From these observations, the rule is:

walm -> Causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm"", the output color for that word is repeated for as many times as the sequence ""word walm"" occurs consecutively before encountering a different word or the end of the input. If ""walm"" is the last word in a sequence or the only word after the initial color word, it causes the color to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is followed by another nonce word with an associated color, the pattern of repetition is interrupted by the new color.",1.0,66,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns present in the examples given:

1. When ""lug walm dax"" is inputted, the output is ""blue blue blue green"". ""Lug"" results in three blues, ""dax"" in a green.

2. For the input ""wif walm dax"", the output is ""red red red green"". ""Wif"" results in three reds, ""dax"" again in green.

3. The input ""dax walm"" yields the output ""green green green"". ""Dax"" this time results in three greens rather than one, as it did in the first two examples when followed by ""walm"".

4. Given the input ""zup dax walm"", the output is ""yellow green green green"". ""Zup"" results in yellow, ""dax"" in a single green, and ""walm"" seems to extend this green.

5. When the input is ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" causes a triple yellow result, and since ""walm"" follows, there is no green as seen in previous outputs with ""dax"".

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color induced by the word that precedes it. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup,"" the color associated with that word gets repeated three times. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which commonly yields a green, the pattern seems to change, suggesting that the behavior of ""walm"" might depend on the position or the word that it follows. In the case with ""dax,"" it results in repeating the green color multiple times instead of just once.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" could be inferred as:

Rule: When walm follows another word, it causes the output to repeat the color output associated with the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" ""walm"" might cause the color output to be extended further than is typical for other words preceding ""walm.""

2. The occurrence of ""walm"" also appears to change the output color sequence that follows it. Specifically, the color after green always appears to be red when ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and yellow when ""walm"" is followed by something other than ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that:

Rule:
- ""walm"" translates to a sequence of green outputs, with the number of green outputs being one more than the number of times ""walm"" appears in sequence.
- If ""walm"" is immediately followed by ""wif,"" the next color is red; otherwise, the next color is determined by the next word in the sequence (for example, ""zup"" leads to yellow).

Let's apply the general rule:

- ""dax walm wif walm zup"": The ""walm wif"" sequence produces three greens followed by a red. Another ""walm"" causes two more greens, and ""zup"" leads to a yellow.
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"": The ""walm wif"" sequence produces three greens followed by a red. ""zup"" leads to a yellow, and the second ""wif"" leads to another red.
- ""dax walm wif bluf"": The ""walm wif"" sequence produces three greens followed by a red. It seems that ""bluf"" does not change the color pattern, implying that it is likely associated with red.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"": The ""dax walm"" sequence produces a green, followed by three more greens, but the sequence is preceded by reds related to ""wif bluf.""
- ""dax zup walm wif"": The ""zup"" leads to a yellow, and the ""walm wif"" sequence produces three greens followed by a red.

Thus, based on the induction from these examples:

walm -> The word ""walm"" results in a sequence of green outputs in the quantity of the count of ""walm"" + 1, followed by a red if the next word is ""wif"" or another color corresponding to the next word if not immediately followed by ""wif"".",0.8,67,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns regarding its position in the input and corresponding colors in the output:

1. In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the ""walm"" corresponds to green when following ""dax"" and red when followed by ""zup,"" and there's an additional red for the second ""walm.""

2. In ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" the ""walm"" corresponds to blue when after ""lug"" and red when before ""zup.""

3. In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the ""walm"" corresponds to green when after ""dax.""

4. In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the ""walm"" corresponds to green when after ""dax.""

5. In ""dax zup walm wif,"" the ""walm"" corresponds to yellow when after ""zup.""

Observing the patterns in the outputs:

- ""dax"" always precedes a sequence of greens.
- ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it, if it is ""dax,"" ""lug"" or appears at the beginning; ""green"" after ""dax,"" ""blue"" after ""lug.""
- ""walm"" turns red before ""zup"" and turns yellow after ""zup.""
- ""wif"" seems to be red when at the beginning but yellow when following ""zup.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color based on the word immediately before it, except when ""zup"" is involved, in which case ""walm"" becomes red before ""zup"" and yellow after ""zup"" (although this also seems affected by the position of ""wif"").

With this pattern, we can induce that ""walm"" may be a rule indicating a change in color based on its position relative to other words, but we need more examples to be certain of the rule for ""walm"" in isolation. However, the most consistent rule based on the provided examples is that ""walm"" takes the color of certain words that come before it, and has a special interaction with ""zup.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word or changes color based on its position relative to ""zup"".",0.7,67,walm
"The examples you've given show that the word ""walm"" is associated with a particular color based on the context it's used in. By examining the patterns, we can try to deduce the rule for what ""walm"" means:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is a series of ""green.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output right after ""walm"" is ""red.""
- When ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" the output is blue only once, followed by red and yellow corresponding to other words.
- When ""walm"" is in the final position after ""dax"" and ""zup,"" the output is two instances of ""yellow"" followed by ""red.""

It's challenging to deduce a definitive rule for what ""walm"" means because it seems to depend on its position and the words around it. However, we consistently see that ""walm"" results in multiple occurrences of the same color. It might be a multiplier of the previous color mentioned or a color shifter based on contextual words; still, we don't have enough consistent information to determine a solid rule.

Given this, the best rule I can induce with the information provided is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The color outputted by ""walm"" depends on the context and the word immediately preceding it. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" it outputs green multiple times. When ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" it outputs red immediately afterward. The word ""walm,"" when used in other contexts, may change the repetition pattern or introduce a new color, which is not consistent across the examples provided.",0.5,67,walm

- ""bluf"" has been translated to ""yellow,"" but occurs only once, and given the consistency of the other words, ""bluf"" may also be ""yellow"" or there could be a typo. Assuming no typo and consistency across all nonce word usage, we will assume ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: Each nonce word directly translates to a unique color, with ""dax"" always corresponding to the color ""green.""

So, the translation for ""dax"" would be:

dax -> green",1.0,68,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

- We observe that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

- ""Bluf"" seems to correspond with ""yellow,"" just like ""zup.""

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - Here, ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" which is ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"" which is also ""red,"" but in the output, the first color is ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue green green yellow blue red""

3. Input: ""wif dax zup wif"" -> Output: ""red green yellow red""
   - Here, ""zup"" is flanked by ""dax"" (corresponding to ""green"") and ""wif"" (corresponding to ""red""), and once again ""yellow"" is in place of ""zup"" in the output.

4. Input: ""zup lug bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue""
   - ""zup"" comes before ""lug"" (""blue"") and ""bluf"" (""blue"") in this example, resulting in ""yellow"" in the output.

5. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> Output: ""green red red red blue yellow""
   - ""zup"" follows ""lug"" (""blue"") and is the last word in the input sequence, and again, ""yellow"" represents ""zup.""

- wif -> red

Now, we need to determine what ""zup"" means in this context. Let's analyze the outputs.

In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red"", and the output is ""yellow red red red"". Since ""yellow"" is not associated with any other words in the list and it appears only once at the beginning, it seems likely that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"".

Let's see if the other examples support this hypothesis:

- In the second example, ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red"", and indeed ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow red"", again ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow"", again supporting the hypothesis that ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule that can be induced is that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

- ""wif dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""red green yellow red""

Therefore, we can define the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

2. When ""wif"" is before ""zup"" or ""bluf"", red precedes these colors.
3. When ""wif"" is between different colors, such as ""lug wif zup,"" red is sandwiched between blue and yellow.
4. When ""wif"" follows the same color twice, like ""dax bluf wif dax"", it is red between two greens which are preceded and followed by the color representing ""dax"".

From this, it seems that the appearance of ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""

bluf -> The color that ""bluf"" translates to is the same as the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.",1.0,69,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> yellow

In the outputs, ""yellow"" appears immediately after the word ""zup"" and also in all instances where the word ""bluf"" is used. The output for ""wif"" is consistently ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Given the repetition of ""yellow"" for both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" in the examples provided, it is clear that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""",1.0,69,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". However, when ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by the word ""wif"" or ""lug"", ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" or ""blue"", respectively. In other cases where ""bluf"" is not immediately preceded by those specific words, ""bluf"" is interpreted as ""yellow"". Thus, ""bluf"" either directly translates to a color, or the color it represents is influenced by the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> yellow, unless preceded by ""wif"", in which case bluf -> red, or preceded by ""lug"", in which case bluf -> blue.",0.8,69,bluf
Rule: bluf -> yellow,0.0,69,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and the corresponding outputs to identify patterns:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
4. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Firstly, it appears that each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that precedes it:

- In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and we get ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and we get ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and we get ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Secondly, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color word exactly three times:

- The examples consistently show a triplet of the same color following the word ""walm.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated three times.

Walm -> meaning: When encountered, repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we need to consider the input and the corresponding output examples provided. 

Looking at the examples:

1. The word ""lug"" is consistently followed by the word ""blue"" once or multiple times in the output.
2. The word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"".
3. The word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"".
4. The word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"".
5. The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""blue"".

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""wif"", and the output is three times ""blue"" followed by two times ""red"". Since ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif"", it seems to repeat the color associated with ""lug"" which is ""blue"" before moving onto the color associated with ""wif"" which is ""red"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", and the output is three times ""green"". Since ""walm"" is after ""dax"" here, it repeats the color associated with ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- In the third example, we see ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" and ""lug"" leading to their respective colors (""yellow"" and ""blue""), and then we have ""zup walm"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, which in this case is ""zup"" corresponding to yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""wif"", and the output is three times ""blue"" followed by a lone ""blue"" and then ""red"". Here again, ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color linked to ""lug"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and the output is three times ""yellow"". Then we have ""lug"" leading to ""blue"", ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"" followed by ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" and ""dax"" leading to ""green"". Once more, ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word, which is ""zup"" corresponding to yellow.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,69,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to mean that the word following it should be repeated thrice in the output color associated with it. In each instance of use, ""walm"" is followed by a word representing a singular color in the output. The pattern is that the color repeats three times regardless of what the color is. The association of the colors to the nonce words (lug, wif, etc.) may be based on another rule, but ""walm"" specifically dictates the repetition of the subsequent color three times.

""walm"" -> Repeat the corresponding color of the next word three times.",1.0,69,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""walm"" appears to be followed by a repetition of colors corresponding to other words that directly precede ""walm."" However, the color ""walm"" translates to is determined by the word that precedes it as follows:

- When ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

The other words (""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax""), when not adjacent to the word ""walm,"" correspond to a single instance of their respective colors (""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green"").

Thus, the rule appears to be: ""walm"" causes the word directly preceding it to produce three instances of its associated color in the output.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,69,walm
"Observing the examples, we can infer that the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, in a set of three repetitions. Here is how it breaks down:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" after ""lug"" means three repetitions of ""blue"".
2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", so ""walm"" after ""dax"" means three repetitions of ""green"".
3. In the third example, ""zup walm"" is translating to ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" after ""zup"" means three repetitions of ""yellow"".
4. In the fourth example, the presence of ""lug walm"" within a sequence repeats ""blue"" three times, and maintains the pattern even when additional color-encoded words appear before or after it.
5. The fifth example again demonstrates that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times, regardless of what comes after.

So, walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-encoded word, it signifies a repetition of that color in the output three times.",1.0,69,walm
"lug -> meaning. By examining the consistent appearance of the word ""lug"" across all the examples and noting that it always corresponds to the output ""blue,"" we can deduce:

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue.""",1.0,70,lug

"lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""lug"" appears to be the color blue, independent of context.

Rule: Lug translates to ""blue"".",1.0,70,lug

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears as an input, it outputs the color ""blue"".",1.0,70,lug
"lug -> meaning. Meaning is ""blue."" 
Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.",1.0,70,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. ""dax"" appears to correspond to a specific color each time it is used.
2. ""dax"" does not correspond to the same color as any of the directly adjacent words.
3. In every instance, ""dax"" is translated as ""green.""

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" represents the color green regardless of the context or sequence of the words. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,70,dax
"Rule: dax -> green.

The rule for ""dax"" seems to be that irrespective of its position in the sequence, it always translates to the color green.",1.0,70,dax
"Based on the examples, we can observe a pattern in the colors that correspond to certain words. Let's analyze each instance:

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax  
Output: red yellow yellow red green  
We notice that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" and ""bluf"" seem to correspond to ""yellow."" The new word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Input: zup dax wif  
Output: yellow green red  
Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug dax wif  
Output: blue green red  
Here we see ""lug"" for the first time, corresponding to ""blue,"" followed by ""dax"" with ""green"" and ""wif"" with ""red"" again.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug  
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue  
All previous word-color correspondences hold, but there is a new word ""walm"" which corresponds to ""blue"" along with ""lug,"" and ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" at its instance. Notably, each instance of ""lug"" after ""dax"" is still ""blue.""

Input: dax walm wif zup  
Output: green green green red yellow  
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" within this context also corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given the consistent correspondence of ""dax"" to ""green"" across all examples, we can form the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,70,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

"Rule: dax -> green

The pattern suggests each nonce word is associated with a specific color:

- wif is associated with red
- zup is associated with yellow
- bluf is associated with yellow
- lug is associated with blue
- walm is associated with blue
- dax is consistently associated with green, every time it appears in the input, the corresponding color in the output is green.",1.0,70,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Here are the deduced associations between the input and the output words:
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue

Now, in every example where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is always ""red"":

- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (lug is blue, wif is red)
- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow (walm is red, dax is green, zup is yellow, and wif is red)
- Input: wif dax zup wif -> Output: red green yellow red (dax is green, zup is yellow, and both instances of wif are red)

So, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

wif -> meaning: red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".",1.0,70,wif
"Given the examples, we can infer a rule by looking at the consistent presence of the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding output color. The word ""wif"" always maps to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,70,wif
"Based on the examples provided where ""wif"" is followed or preceded by various words and each instance where ""wif"" appears correlates to a specific color in the output, I can deduce the following:

- When ""wif"" appears, the consistent output color is red.
- Other words such as ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" correspond to specific colors regardless of their position in the input.

Here's the breakdown of the color association with each word, including ""wif"":

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Given this information, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,70,wif
"Observing the given examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color output. The word ""wif"" appears in all sequences where its corresponding output color is ""red."" There is no deviation in this pattern across the different examples.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,70,wif
"To figure out the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look closely at the correlation between the input and output within the examples provided. It seems that every unique word in the input maps to a specific color in the output.

For example:
- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""
- ""walm"" always translates to ""red,"" except when it is preceded by ""wif.""
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue.""

The word ""wif"" appears to change the color that follows it:
- When ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" ""lug"" translates to ""red"" instead of its usual ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" translates to ""red,"" which is its usual color, suggesting no change in this case.
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" ""dax"" which usually translates to ""green,"" follows as ""red.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" ""zup"" which usually translates to ""yellow,"" is ""red.""

According to these observations, it seems that ""wif"" turns the following word into ""red,"" regardless of what color it would have been otherwise, except when ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" where ""walm"" still translates to ""red.""

However, considering the consistency of translation for all other words, the exception might result from a insufficient data to decide if ""wif walm"" should be translated as double ""red"" or an error.

Taking the most consistent interpretation of ""wif"" based on the data:

- In ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" represents yellow, so ""walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" represents blue, so ""walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue.""",1.0,70,walm
"From the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

The word 'walm' appears to result in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times. For example:

- In ""zup wif walm"", 'wif' represents red, so 'walm' results in ""red red red"".
- In ""lug walm"", 'lug' represents blue, so 'walm' results in ""blue blue blue"".

Therefore, we can derive the following rule:

"Rule: walm -> the preceding color repeated three times.

In all examples, walm converts to three repetitions of the color that is mentioned just before walm.",1.0,70,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns before and after the word in each example and match them with the output provided.

- In the first example, ""wif"" comes after ""walm,"" and ""wif"" seems to correspond with the color red, as ""wif"" is followed by ""red."" ""Zup"" comes before ""walm,"" which seems to correspond with ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""wif"" again follows ""walm,"" resulting in ""red."" ""Dax,"" which comes before ""walm,"" corresponds with green, and ""zup"" corresponds with yellow.

- In the third example, ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output is three blues, implying that ""lug"" might correspond with blue.

- In the fourth example, ""zup dax lug"" come before ""walm"" and result in yellow, green, and three blues. ""Zup"" comes again at the end, adding another yellow.

- In the fifth example, ""zup lug"" come before ""walm,"" and ""wif dax"" come after. The sequence results in yellow, four blues, red, and green. 

Based on the inputs and outputs, it seems that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes before it, repeated three times. 

Hence, if we were to write the rule it would be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. 

So, if ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is followed by ""walm,"" the output will be ""blue blue blue."" If ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and is followed by ""walm,"" the output will be ""yellow yellow yellow.""",1.0,70,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Each time ""walm"" appears, the color that comes right before it is repeated three times in the output.

Let's look at the examples to establish the rule:

- Input: zup wif walm — Output: yellow red red red
  ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" causes red to repeat three times.

- Input: dax zup walm wif — Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
  ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which causes yellow to repeat three times, followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to red.

- Input: lug walm — Output: blue blue blue
  ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes blue to repeat three times.

- Input: zup dax lug walm zup — Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
  ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" following ""lug"" repeats blue three times. ""zup"" at the end corresponds to yellow again.

- Input: zup lug walm wif dax — Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
  ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" causes blue to repeat three times, ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to green.

Based on this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

3. ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green.""
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red.""
5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red green green red blue.""

In every occurrence, irrespective of position, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"" in the output. The surrounding words lead to different colors, but ""dax"" does not seem to be influenced by them. Therefore, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,71,dax
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the word ""dax"" seems consistent:

As such, we can state the following rule:

In the first input sequence ""wif dax bluf,"" the word ""wif"" leads to the output ""red."" In the second sequence, ""dax wif dax,"" ""wif"" is again associated with ""red."" The third sequence ""zup bluf wif walm"" gives us ""red red red"" for the ""wif walm"" part, and the fourth sequence ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red"" for ""wif."" Finally, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" associates ""wif"" with ""red"" once again.

From these examples, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

So, we can conclude:

wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""wif"" means ""red.""",1.0,71,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow
- zup -> yellow

The pattern appears to be that each time ""wif"" appears, the output color changes. To confirm this, we observe each instance of ""wif"":

- wif dax bluf -> red green green
- dax wif dax -> green red green
- zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

From these examples, the rule for ""wif"" seems to correlate with the color red. However, the number of times ""red"" appears is equal to the number of words following ""wif,"" including ""wif"" itself. This pattern holds across all examples.

3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (wif corresponds to red)
4. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow (wif corresponds to red)
5. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue (wif corresponds to red)

In every instance, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output. This consistency across multiple examples supports the conclusion that:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,71,wif
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif.""

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by two ""bluf"" words, which both correspond to the color green. However, ""wif"" corresponds to red, suggesting that ""wif"" is not directly related to the color green but may represent the color red in this context.

2. In the second example, ""wif"" is placed between two ""dax"" words, which both yield the color green in the output. Since ""wif"" has an output of red here as well, it reinforces the idea that ""wif"" represents the color red.

3. In the third example, ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence followed by ""walm,"" and both ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to the color red. This example suggests that both ""wif"" and ""walm"" might represent the color red or there is some positional aspect that we might be missing.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""bluf,"" both outputting red. This supports the hypothesis that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

5. In the final example, ""wif"" is in the middle of the sequence and is followed by a ""zup,"" which is consistently yellow. ""Wif"" still outputs red, providing further support that ""wif"" is associated with the color red.

Taking into account these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be consistent across the examples:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Therefore:

wif -> red",1.0,71,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the example inputs and their respective outputs:

1. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

2. Input: dax wif dax
   Output: green red green

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

5. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Let's try to isolate where ""wif"" appears and what color it is associated with in the output.

- In example 1, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax bluf"" and corresponds to ""red"".
- In example 2, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""dax"", corresponding to ""red"".
- In example 3, ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and is followed by ""walm"", corresponding to ""red"".
- In example 4, ""wif"" is the first word and corresponds to ""red"".
- In example 5, ""wif"" is preceded by ""bluf"" followed by ""zup bluf lug"", and corresponds to ""red"".

In every instance, the presence of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,71,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following correspondence for the word ""zup"" and other words:

- Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

None of the examples contradict these associations, as they are consistently applied across all examples. We can therefore induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the output ""yellow."" Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" as follows:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word zup translates to the color yellow, regardless of the context in which it appears.",1.0,71,zup
"From the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific output, regardless of other words' presence. Here's the pattern observed:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears alone or following any word, the output is ""yellow.""
- Other words, such as ""wif"" and ""lug,"" correspond to their own colors (""wif"" to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"").

Looking at the examples:

- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"" — ""wif"" gives us ""red,"" and ""zup"" gives us ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" — ""lug"" gives us ""blue,"" ""zup"" gives us ""yellow,"" ""wif"" gives us ""red."" Note that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" based on this context.
- ""wif zup lug"" translates to ""red yellow blue"" — ""wif"" gives us ""red,"" ""zup"" gives us ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" gives us ""blue.""
- Since ""zup"" alone provides the output ""yellow,"" it reaffirms that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on this, the rule can be stated as:

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow (bluf follows zup, which corresponds to yellow)

"Based on the examples you've provided, the word ""bluf"" correlates to the word ""red."" Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: bluf -> red.",1.0,71,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"". Every time ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present at that position in the output. 

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,71,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like the word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Let's analyze the examples to understand better:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red."" Here, ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows it, ""walm"" results in repeating ""blue"" twice more. Then ""wif"" ends the sequence with ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue."" The same rule applies; ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" so ""walm"" repeats it twice more.

3. In the third example, ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red."" ""Lug"" outputs ""blue,"" ""wif"" changes to ""red,"" and ""walm"" then repeats the color of the word just before it, which is ""red,"" three times.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" ""Zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" (the color of ""zup"") twice, ""dax"" is ""green,"" another ""zup"" continues with ""yellow,"" followed by ""dax"" again with ""green,"" and finally ""wif"" changes to ""red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup walm dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Again, ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" (the color of ""zup"") twice, and ""dax"" is ""green.""

From these observations, we can infer the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeats the output color of the word immediately before it three times.",1.0,71,walm
"Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color associated with the preceding word. If ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", then ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of ""blue"". If ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"", then ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green"", where ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times before ""dax"" changes the color to ""green"".

Therefore:

walm -> The rule is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,71,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we must compare the inputs and outputs to understand the correlation between them. Here are the steps in deducing the meaning:

1. Notice that every time ""walm"" appears, it corresponds to a series of ""blue"" in the output.
2. Every instance of ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"" if it is not followed by any other words.
3. If ""walm"" is followed by another word (e.g., ""wif""), it is translated as a series of ""red"" after the original ""blue"" series. This shift seems to occur if ""walm"" is not the last word in the input: ""lug wif walm"" leads to a ""blue red red red,"" with the shift happening after the initial ""blue.""
4. The preceding word (e.g., ""lug"" or ""zup"") seems to set the color pattern for one repetition of that color, followed by the pattern set by ""walm.""

So, based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it corresponds to three ""blue"" in the output. If ""walm"" is followed by another word, that triggers a shift in color, which seems to depend on the particular word that follows ""walm.""

Hence the rule-induced interpretation for ""walm"" is:

walm -> three repetitions of the color ""blue"", with a possible shift in color if followed by another word.",0.9,71,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the output color sequence changes every time the nonce word ""walm"" is added to the input sequence. To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the pattern changes in the output sequences:

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
Here, “lug” corresponds to ""blue,"" and adding ""walm"" after ""lug"" still results in ""blue."" However, the presence of ""wif"" after ""walm"" changes the output color to ""red"" instead of the expected color based on the ""wif"" input alone.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Here, we see that the addition of ""walm"" following ""lug"" maintains the color ""blue.""

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
In this example, the ""walm"" placed after ""wif"" changes the color that would otherwise be associated with ""wif"" to ""red.""

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
In this sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" initially corresponds to ""green"" after ""walm."" However, in the ""zup dax wif"" portion, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""red,"" suggesting that perhaps ""walm"" is influencing the following word to alter its usual output color.

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
Similar to the previous example, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and the introduction of ""walm"" before ""dax"" results in ""dax"" being ""green"" instead of its presumed natural color output.

Based on the examples given, ""walm"" seems to modify the color output of the word that immediately follows it. If a color word is understood to follow ""walm,"" it is changed to ""red."" If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it retains blue, but it may not be affecting ""lug"" because there is no color word following ""walm."" If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it retains yellow and changes the following ""dax"" to ""green.""

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" is present in a sequence, it changes the color output of the word that follows it to ""red"" if that word is otherwise associated with a color output. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" or ""zup,"" the colors ""blue"" and ""yellow"" are retained, but the next word's output (if it is a color-associated word) is ""green"" for ""dax"" or ""red"" for ""wif."" If ""walm"" does not have a following word or the following word is not color-associated, it retains the color of the word preceding ""walm.""",0.8,71,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify the pattern between the input and their corresponding outputs.

Let's look for patterns:

1. ""lug walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red"".
2. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".
3. ""lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red red red"".
4. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"".
5. ""zup walm dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green"".

From these examples, we can start to see a pattern where the word ""walm"" is always followed by three repeats of a color, except when followed by ""wif"" where only two repeats of the color is followed by ""red"".

Now, looking at the third input and output, ""lug wif walm"" is followed by ""blue red red red"", it seems that ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned before it, but ""wif"" alters the color to red.

Additional observations include two unique words before ""walm"":

- ""lug"" is consistently followed by ""blue"".
- ""zup"" is consistently followed by ""yellow"".

No other words have a one-to-one correspondence with other colors, such as ""dax"", which is followed by ""green"" only when it immediately follows ""walm"".

Based on the examples given:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word directly before it three times.

Using this rule:

walm -> meaning. ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the prior color three times.

For example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats it three times.",0.8,71,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,72,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,72,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever the input contains the word 'lug', the corresponding output is consistently 'blue'.
- Other words appear to correspond to other colors consistently as well (e.g., 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'bluf' corresponds to 'red').
- There is no indication that the meaning of 'lug' changes depending on its position within the input sequence, as it always results in 'blue' regardless of its ordering.

Therefore, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,72,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,72,lug
"lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" in these examples consistently translates to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug = blue",1.0,72,lug
Rule: dax -> green.,1.0,72,dax
"Based on the examples provided where the word ""dax"" corresponds to a particular output each time it is mentioned, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".",1.0,72,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,72,dax
dax -> green,1.0,72,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,72,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Regardless of other words' presence or position in the input sequence, ""wif"" always results in ""red"" in the output. This is observed in all examples given, including when ""wif"" appears at the beginning, middle, or end of an input string. Therefore, we can conclude the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

"Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output language. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, a single ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,72,zup
"Considering each example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". This relationship seems consistent and independent of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in an input, it is translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,72,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to correlate with the color ""yellow"". Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds with ""yellow"" in the output. Here's the rule that encapsulates this relationship:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,72,zup
"From the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" likely means ""yellow,"" as ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" likely means a single ""yellow,"" and each ""walm"" is also ""yellow."" Note that ""wif"" means ""red.""
- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" which, if ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" further suggests ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green."" This maintains consistency, with ""wif"" being ""red,"" ""dax"" being ""green,"" and ""zup"" being the singular ""yellow"" in the sequence.
- ""zup"" alone translates to just ""yellow.""

Putting it all together, we can state the following rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"".",1.0,72,zup
"Based on the provided examples, each nonce word appears to correspond to a color:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when following the word ""zup""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when following ""zup""
- When ""zup"" stands alone or is the first word, it corresponds to ""yellow""

The word ""zup"" seems to act as a marker for the color ""yellow"", but when it is followed by certain words, it may affect the output of those words, turning ""bluf"" and ""walm"" into ""yellow"". However, this pattern is not seen with ""dax"" or ""wif"", which retain their original colors after ""zup"". Therefore, ""zup"" by itself or placed before any word yields ""yellow"", and possibly alters the output of some words that follow it.

Rule: ""zup"" indicates the color ""yellow"" when it stands alone, or when it precedes certain words, it may turn those words into ""yellow"" as well.",0.9,72,zup
"Based on the examples you provided, we can infer the following:

- The output color does not depend on the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

- The color associated with ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that immediately precedes it:

    - When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" (examples 1, 2, and 5), the output color for ""bluf"" is green.
    - When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" (examples 1 and 3), the output color for ""bluf"" is red.
    - When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" (example 4), the output color for ""bluf"" is blue.

- In example 5, despite ""zup"" and ""wif"" appearing before ""walm,"" the output color is not influenced by these words when ""walm"" is present. This suggests ""walm"" does not inherit its associated color from preceding words.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" acts as a mirror or duplicator for the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color output of the word preceding it.",1.0,72,bluf

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

- In ""lug bluf,"" lug = blue, and thus bluf also yields blue.

Considering the first example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and then ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

However, observing the entire pattern, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that precedes it:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue""
- A repeated ""zup dax bluf"" continues to translate to ""yellow green green""
- In the case of ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" takes the color value of the preceding words, ""wif"" and ""zup,"" thus translating to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that comes before bluf.",1.0,73,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when preceded by wif, green when preceded by dax, and yellow when preceded by zup.",1.0,73,bluf
"Rule: The noun ""bluf"" seems to represent the color green. Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output associated with it is ""green.""",1.0,73,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for a pattern in the given examples. Given the same input word, the output color does not change, suggesting a direct mapping from specific words to colors.

From the examples provided:
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" only shows up once and is associated with ""green,"" but we cannot be certain it always maps to ""green"" without further examples.

Examining the instances of ""bluf"" specifically:
- In both the first and fourth examples, when the input sequence is ""zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green green,"" which suggests ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in this context.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" again could correspond to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug"" maps to ""blue blue green blue,"" here too ""bluf"" is associated with ""green,"" since ""dax"" and ""lug"" are consistently ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively.
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" maps to ""red red yellow yellow red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" following a ""zup,"" or possibly more generally after any color word.

Combining the above observations, we can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" except when it follows ""zup,"" in which case it corresponds to ""yellow.""

So the rule appears to be:
- ""bluf"" -> ""green"" when it follows any word other than ""zup.""
- ""bluf"" -> ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow""; otherwise, it means ""green.""",0.9,73,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to be an indicator that the subsequent colors should be repeated based on the most recent color mentioned. Here's the pattern I observed:

- After ""lug walm"", blue is repeated three times.
- In the second example, after ""dax zup walm"", yellow is repeated three times before wif (red).
- In the third and fourth examples, after ""dax walm"", green is repeated thrice, indicating that walm causes the repetition of the color that was last mentioned.
- In the last example, after ""zup bluf wif walm"", red is repeated three times.

So, it seems that the rule is as follows:

Rule: walm causes the color output that directly precedes it to be repeated three times.

walm -> causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three more times.",1.0,73,walm
"By analyzing the given examples, we can try to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's look at the examples to see what patterns emerge:

1. When ""lug walm"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in an additional ""blue.""
2. When ""dax zup walm"" appears, the output starts with ""green yellow yellow,"" but then when ""walm"" appears, we see an additional ""yellow"" extending the sequence before it (yellow for ""zup"").
3. When ""dax walm"" appears by itself, ""green green green"" is the output, indicating that ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to an additional ""green.""
4. When ""zup bluf wif walm"" appears, ""yellow yellow red red"" is the output, where ""walm"" following ""wif"" leads to additional reds.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color indicated by the previous word. Thus:

- ""lug walm"" leads to an additional ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" leads to an additional ""green.""
- ""zup walm"" leads to an additional ""yellow.""
- ""wif walm"" leads to additional ""reds.""

When walm follows a color-indicating word, it seems to result in a repetition of the color output associated with that word. Therefore, we can infer that walm means ""repeat the previous color.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color.",1.0,73,walm
"Observing the provided input-output pairs, we can try to determine the pattern that informs the transformation of the nonce word ""walm"" into a color in the output.

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. The word ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates ""blue,"" which is the same color as ""lug.""

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

In the second example, ""dax"" translates to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. Here ""walm"" following ""zup"" generates two additional ""yellow"" outputs.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

In the third example, once again ""dax"" translates to green and ""wif"" to red, while ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to two additional ""green"" colors.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

The fourth example solidifies the pattern we see with ""walm"" following ""dax"": it produces two additional ""green"" outputs, identical to the color assigned to ""dax.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

In the last example, we see that ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which in previous examples produced ""red,"" and here it also results in ""red."" What is unusual here, however, is that ""bluf"" is not established in the previous examples, but the pattern suggests that it translates to ""yellow"" here, given its position between ""zup"" (known to be yellow) and ""wif"" (known to be red). This example is not as clear, but we can surmise that ""bluf"" behave similar to previously known inputs and that ""walm"" still acts in generating additional colors in the same manner as the word that precedes it.

From these examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it generates two additional outputs that match the color of the word that precedes it. 

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color of the preceding word two more times.",0.9,73,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze how it affects the output in each given example. Let's break down each instance where ""walm"" is used:

1. When ""lug walm"" occurs together, the output is ""blue blue blue."" But without ""walm,"" ""lug"" by itself corresponds to a single ""blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" following ""lug"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" the outputs following ""walm"" are a repeated color and then ""red."" Specifically, after ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" and after ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red."" This shows that ""walm"" causes the color preceding it to repeat and is also associated with ""red"" when following ""wif.""

3. When ""dax walm"" occurs, the output is ""green green green,"" suggesting ""walm"" causes the preceding color ""green"" to repeat, similar to the first example.

4. ""Dax walm"" by itself also leads to the repeated ""green"" output, further demonstrating that ""walm"" is linked to repetition.

5. Finally, in ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" following ""wif"" correlates to a repeated ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color associated with the preceding word to be repeated. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it is specifically associated with repeating ""red.""

Therefore:
walm -> causes the preceding color to repeat, except after ""wif"" where it causes ""red"" to repeat.",0.8,73,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it as many times as the position of ""walm"", plus once for the occurrence of ""walm"" itself. Here is the breakdown:

1. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""
2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""

So the rule in each case:
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax zup"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times and when ""walm"" appears again, ""red"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""zup bluf wif"", ""red"" is repeated three times.

The appearance of ""wif"" indicates a switch to ""red"" after ""walm"". In the absence of ""wif"" after ""walm"", ""walm"" means repeat the previous color without switching to ""red"".

Given the above observations, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the sequence from the start of the sequence, plus once for the occurrence of ""walm"" itself. If ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" switch to red after the repeats.",0.8,73,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" correlates with the output ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears an equal number of times in the output. The rest of the output colors do not show a consistent pattern with respect to ""lug."" Here are the correlations with the provided inputs:

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to the first ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to the last ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to the fourth ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to the first ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,74,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's analyze the patterns where it appears.

1. When ""lug"" appears with ""walm"" (regardless of what other words are present), all instances of ""walm"" transform into ""blue"" before the last word (which could be different and seems to be governed by another rule). For example:

   Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
   
   Even in the presence of ""walm"" multiple times, they all change to ""blue"":

   Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red

   It suggests that ""lug"" causes ""walm"" to change to ""blue,"" but the rule has to be consistent with inputs where ""lug"" comes after ""walm,"" which do not seem to change the outcome.

2. When ""lug"" appears without ""walm,"" it maps directly to ""blue"":

   Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow

   This suggests that ""lug"" on its own translates to ""blue.""

3. When ""lug"" appears after another word that is not ""walm,"" it still translates to blue, revealed by:

   Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue

The only consistent rule that can be deduced from the examples given is:

Rule: lug -> blue

Irrespective of its position or the words around it, “lug” always translates to “blue” in the output.",1.0,74,lug
"Based on the examples provided, here is the rule induction for the word ""lug"":

- Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears, it also translates to ""blue"" in the output, and this does not seem to change regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
- When ""lug"" is in the input and followed by ""wif,"" it seems that ""wif"" then corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" is not present, ""walm"" and ""wif"" translate to different colors, as seen in the second and third examples where ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From these observations, it can be deduced that ""lug"" might act as a color identifier or a modifier for the following words in the sequence. When ""lug"" is present, it enforces the color ""blue"" for itself and potentially for ""walm"" right after it, while it turns ""wif"" into ""red.""

Rule: lug -> ""blue"" and has the power to enforce or change the color identification of certain following words in a sequence.",0.9,74,lug
"Analyzing the examples provided, here's what I observe:

1. When ""lug"" is present, the output always starts with ""blue"". 
2. The presence of other words seems to determine the color that follows, and ""lug"" doesn't seem to affect the output color for those words (e.g., ""walm"" always leads to ""blue"" following it, ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"").
3. In the second and third examples, the order of ""walm"" and ""wif"" is changed, yet the output colors for ""walm"" and ""wif"" remain constant (""red"" for ""wif"" and ""yellow"" for ""walm""), suggesting they are independent of order. ""lug"" also retains its ""blue"" output regardless of position.
4. In the absence of other words, ""lug"" alone leads to ""blue,"" which is consistent with it leading to ""blue"" in all other instances.

Given these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""lug"" maps to the output color ""blue,"" and it does so consistently regardless of its position or the other words around it.

So, lug -> ""blue"".",0.9,74,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the provided examples:

1. ""lug walm dax"" -> Output: blue blue blue green
2. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: yellow red red red blue
3. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> Output: blue blue blue red red
5. ""lug zup"" -> Output: blue yellow

Initially, ""lug"" appears in different positions and is associated with the color ""blue."" When ""lug"" is the first word in the input, it seems to turn all following words that are ""walm"" to ""blue"" until a different word that is not ""lug"" or ""walm"" appears (as seen in examples 1 and 4). However, when ""lug"" is not the first word in the input, it only converts itself to ""blue,"" while the other words result in different colors regardless of whether they are ""walm"" or not (as seen in examples 2 and 3).

Based on this analysis, we can derive the rule for ""lug"":

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,74,dax
"Based on the given examples, each word (zup, lug, dax, walm, bluf) corresponds to a color (yellow, blue, green, yellow, red). 

The word ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" is consistent and does not depend on context within these examples.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,74,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently in every example.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,74,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce that the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red' regardless of its position in the series. Every time 'wif' appears in the input, it is translated to 'red' in the output. 

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: Whenever wif appears in the input, it is translated to the color red in the output.",1.0,74,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, when ""zup"" appears with ""wif"" in between (""zup wif zup""), the output is ""yellow red yellow,"" which implies that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""wif"" on its own produces the output ""red.""

- In the third example, ""lug dax wif"" translates to ""blue green red,"" again with ""wif"" resulting in ""red.""

- In the fourth and fifth examples, wherever the word ""wif"" appears, it translates to ""red"" in the output.

So the rule is as follows:

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

"Based on the examples provided:

Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" aligning with the previous example.

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Here, the presence of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") translates to ""yellow"" again, which is not consistent with the previous examples if we consider ""bluf"" to always correspond to ""blue.""

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is a repeat of the previous color, ""dax"" (green).

Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" again, which is a repeat of the color that directly precedes it, ""wif"" (red).

Based on all these examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word in a sequence and has no color to take from a previous word, there is not enough information given to determine what color it should be.

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.",0.8,74,bluf
"First, I will analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but in the second example ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" In the third example, it corresponds to ""yellow"" again, but in the fourth example, it corresponds to ""green,"" and in the last example, ""red."" 

This inconsistency suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" may not be tied to a specific color but might change depending on some aspect within the context. To identify a pattern, let's analyze the positions:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug,"" it corresponds to ""blue.""
3. When ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""yellow.""
4. When ""bluf"" is the last word and has two instances of ""dax"" before it, it corresponds to ""green.""
5. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""red.""

Given the inconsistency and the positional dependency, there doesn't seem to be a single clear rule governing ""bluf."" It could be that ""bluf"" is acting as a sort of wildcard that takes on different values depending on other words or the positions of words within the input sequence.

- After ""walm"" is used, the next color ""wif"" is changed to ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""
- The sequence of colors repeats the color green.

""Wif,"" as mentioned earlier, typically outputs ""red"" but after ""dax"" becomes ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" may influence the following word.

But then we see ""zup"" after ""wif"" does not become green but is ""yellow,"" which could mean the influence of ""dax"" does not extend past one word, or there's a different rule for ""zup"".

The phrase ""lug bluf wif"" after ""dax"" gives us ""blue blue red,"" and ""bluf"" typically responds as ""blue"" (as seen in ""lug bluf wif""), which means there is no change for ""bluf"" whether ""dax"" is present before it or not.

From ""dax zup bluf,"" we see that ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" following ""dax"" consistently but that ""bluf"" changes to ""yellow"" instead of its usual ""blue."" This inconsistency with ""bluf"" after ""dax"" suggests the rule might be about positional influence rather than a simple one-to-one word-to-color mapping.

Given the information, we might now postulate that ""dax"" causes the word immediately following it to turn green, regardless of what that word normally produces. However, since ""bluf"" turns yellow after ""dax zup,"" and in the case where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (not after ""dax"") it remains blue, it could suggest a rule where ""dax"" makes the next word ""green"" and has some other kind of influence on other colors following it, potentially making blues yellow.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.,1.0,75,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in repeating the color that corresponds to the last word before ""walm,"" repeated three times. The rules for the other words (assuming they correspond to colors based on the output) seem to be as follows: 

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Therefore, ""walm"" appears to take the color associated with the previous word and repeats it three times.

"walm -> Repeats the color of the word just before it three times.

Rule: If 'walm' follows a color word, it causes the output to repeat that color three times.",1.0,75,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

For example:

- In ""zup wif dax walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" has no color association, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. Following ""dax,"" ""walm"" generates ""green green green"".
- In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Following ""zup,"" ""walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow"", and it ends with ""lug"" which is blue.
- In ""zup dax walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. Following ""dax,"" ""walm"" generates ""green green green"".
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and following ""zup,"" ""walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" generates ""blue blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the preceding word's associated color three times.",1.0,75,walm
"Based on the given examples, each usage of walm produces an output consisting of multiple instances of a color that seems to correspond to the color word that precedes it. Analyzing the pattern:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated four times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

It appears that walm causes the output to repeat the color that directly precedes it a certain number of times. Additionally, the number of repetitions might correspond to the length of the color word that comes before walm (e.g., ""zup"" has four letters, and ""yellow"" is repeated three times; ""lug"" has three letters, and ""blue"" is repeated four times, which doesn't completely align unless there's an additional factor or mistake).

The most consistent pattern is:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue"" is repeated four times.
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green"" is repeated three times.

Here’s the rule based on the above observations:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color that precedes it, with the number of repetitions being either three or four times, possibly depending on a factor not completely clear from the given examples, but likely related to the specific color word preceding it.

"Based on the given examples, the rule underlying the problem seems to be a direct mapping between the nonce word ""dax"" and the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output contains the color ""green."" This pattern holds regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,76,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,76,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. The context or position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to affect its corresponding output; it consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its placement.

Therefore, the rule is:
dax -> green",1.0,76,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Here are the patterns observed:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input string, ""green"" appears in the output string.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input string does not affect its corresponding output; it always maps to ""green,"" irrespective of its position.

Thus, the rule seems to be:
dax -> green",1.0,76,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

- When ""dax"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
- When ""dax"" appears elsewhere, it produces ""green.""

However, the position of ""dax"" in the input does not always correlate with its position in the output. For instance:

- Input: ""zup wif dax walm"" gives the output: ""yellow red green green green,"" where ""green"" appears thrice, possibly corresponding to ""dax walm.""
- Input: ""zup lug zup dax"" gives the output: ""yellow blue yellow green,"" where ""green"" appears once at the end, possibly corresponding to ""dax.""

It seems like ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" but other words' translations or the order of them might influence the output's composition and structure, making it challenging to deduce a rule for other words without additional information.

Rule: dax -> green",0.8,76,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,76,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""wif"" outputs ""red"" and each instance of ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" outputs ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue"" respectively, no matter the position of the words in the input string.

Here are the color mappings:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""walm"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue

So, from the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,76,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,76,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word is assigned to a particular color. The word ""wif"" consistently yields the output ""red."" Depending on the example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" or ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" There is only one instance of ""wif"" in conjunction with each of the other words, and it always comes before them. 

One possible rule is that the word ""wif"" is directly translated to ""red,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,76,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns and the corresponding colors in the given inputs and outputs:

1. Whenever ""wif"" is present, ""red"" is always in the output.
2. ""wif"" does not seem to influence the colors attributed to other words, as ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" retain their color associations (""walm"" with yellow, ""dax"" with green, and ""lug"" with blue) regardless of the presence of ""wif.""
3. The number of times ""red"" is repeated corresponds to the position of ""wif"" in the input:

- ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red"" for ""wif"" and then the respective colors for ""walm"" and an undefined ""zup.""
- ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red"" for ""wif"" and then the respective colors for ""walm"" and ""dax.""
- ""lug wif lug"" has ""red"" only once for ""wif"" and ""blue"" for ""lug,"" which appears twice.
- ""wif lug"" yields a single ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""

From these observations, we can infer the following rule for ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red."" The number of times ""red"" is repeated in the output corresponds to the number of words before ""wif"" plus one (including ""wif"" itself).

Therefore:

wif -> red",1.0,76,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" No context is given where ""zup"" takes on a different meaning or where it depends on the surrounding words to alter its representation. It appears to be an invariant mapping onto the color yellow, regardless of its position within the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,76,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears in the examples.",1.0,76,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""walm"" is consistently followed by ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

While ""zup"" does not seem to correspond to a fixed color as the other words do, it consistently precedes a sequence of colors and is followed by ""yellow"" in the output. There isn't enough variability in the examples given to define a more complex rule for ""zup,"" so based on the examples provided:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,76,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,76,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,76,zup
Rule: bluf means to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.,1.0,76,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Here's the rule observed from the examples:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": The color associated with ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"": The color associated with ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow"": The color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red"": ""dax"" before ""bluf"" is associated with green, so ""bluf"" repeats green.

Hence, the rule is:

bluf -> Repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: If a word X has an associated color Y, ""X bluf"" will result in ""Y Y"" in the output.",1.0,76,bluf
"To deduce the rule, we need to analyze each example and look for a pattern. Let's analyze the examples one by one in relation to their outputs:

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. lug bluf -> blue blue
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
5. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red

In examples 1, 3, and 5, after the word 'dax' (which corresponds to green), the word 'bluf' also corresponds to green. Similarly, in example 2, after the word 'lug' (which corresponds to blue), the word 'bluf' also corresponds to blue.

A pattern evident in all examples is that the word 'bluf' takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence. If 'bluf' follows a word with a known color, then 'bluf' is that color. In example 4, 'bluf' follows 'zup' (which is yellow), and therefore 'bluf' is yellow in that context. 

When 'bluf' is at the end of a sequence, it seems to repeat the color of the word just before it. There is no example where 'bluf' starts the sequence, so we can't deduce a rule for that scenario with the given data.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,76,bluf
"Rule: bluf translates to the color associated with the word directly preceding it. If there is no word preceding it, it repeats the translation of the last color word used.

- In the first input, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and thus ""bluf"" following ""dax"" also translates to ""green.""
- In the second input, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the third input, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" following ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- In the fourth input, although ""bluf"" is not preceded directly by a color word, the last color word used is ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""green."" The second ""bluf"" in the sequence translates to ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif,"" the word immediately preceding it.

Bluf -> The color associated with the preceding word or, if not directly preceded by a color word, repeats the last color word.",1.0,76,bluf
"Based on the color patterns associated with the words presented before and after ‘bluf’ in each example, we can deduce a rule for what ‘bluf’ stands for. Notice that whenever 'bluf' appears, it is translated as the color that immediately precedes it. 

Here are the detailed observations leading to the rule induction:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow,"" so 'bluf' matched with 'dax', which is green.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" so 'bluf' matched with 'lug', which is blue.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" so 'bluf' again matched with 'dax', which is green.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf"" translates to ""red yellow yellow,"" so 'bluf' matched with 'zup', which is yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red."" Here, 'bluf' is again green, matching with 'dax'.

"walm -> a color repeated three times. Rule: The specific color is determined by the word that precedes walm. 'lug' corresponds to blue, 'dax' to green, 'zup' to yellow, and 'wif' to red. Each instance of 'walm' is replaced by three repetitions of the corresponding color.",1.0,76,walm
"walm -> The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times. If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times.",1.0,76,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the preceding nonce word three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"". Thus, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue and ""walm"" indicates that this color should be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" outputs ""green green green red red red yellow"", where ""dax"" is associated with green and repeated three times because of ""walm"", ""wif"" with red, and finally ""zup"" with yellow (although ""walm"" does not follow ""zup"" here, so no repetition).
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"", thereby associating ""zup"" with yellow and ""walm"" indicating the thrice repetition of yellow.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red"" which suggests that ""wif"" is associated with red, but ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the output since ""zup"" had already determined the initial color.

Rule: walm -> triggers a repetition of the preceding color word three times.",1.0,76,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with a certain color, repeated three times in the output. The color that corresponds to ""walm"" changes with the preceding word. Below are the observed patterns:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When followed by ""wif,"" which seems to be associated with ""red,"" based on the ""wif walm"" in the third example resulting in ""red red red,"" ""walm"" also results in three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""wif.""

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to cause the output to be the color associated with the word directly preceding it, repeated three times.

Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
Input: wif bluf lug | Output: red red blue
Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow

When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" could repeat the color associated with the word right before it (since ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in all instances).

When ""bluf"" is preceded by different words such as ""zup"" and ""wif,"" it again outputs the color associated with the preceding words twice. In both ""zup wif bluf"" and ""wif bluf lug,"" the presence of ""wif"" results in ""red red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it, in a double pattern.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word twice.",1.0,77,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" it's helpful to look for patterns in the input and output pairs.

1. Whenever ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output begins with the color ""green.""
2. If ""zup"" is present, either before or after ""bluf,"" the output includes the color ""yellow.""
3. The presence of ""wif"" with ""bluf"" results in the color ""red.""
4. It seems that ""bluf"" itself could correspond to the color ""green"" when it directly follows ""dax,"" ""yellow"" when it is adjacent to ""zup,"" and ""red"" when it is near ""wif.""

To test this theory, it's essential to see if there's consistency when the same input is provided:

- ""dax zup bluf"" leads to the output ""green yellow yellow,"" and as this input is repeated in the examples, it consistently yields the same output. 

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word directly preceding it:

- If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red.""

Since ""bluf"" itself isn't consistent in its output across different contexts, we can deduce it is not a standalone color but rather a placeholder for the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color associated with the word immediately before it in the sequence.
- If ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- If ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- If ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red.""",0.8,77,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to observe the patterns in each input and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
2. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
3. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
4. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
5. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow

Looking at the examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color green is in the output.
- ""zup"" seems to be associated with yellow.
- ""wif"" seems to be associated with red.
- ""lug"" alone at the end results in blue.

When ""bluf"" is present in the input, the first color in the output seems to repeat. This repetition occurs irrespective of the words before ""bluf."" In all cases, except the one involving ""lug,"" ""bluf"" appears last in the input, and the last color in the output repeats the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Observations:

1. ""dax"" => green
2. ""zup"" => yellow
3. ""wif"" => red
4. ""bluf"" => repeater of the preceding color
5. ""lug,"" when it follows ""bluf,"" changes the repeating sequence and adds blue to the end.

Based on the observations, ""bluf"" appears to be a function or operation that causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> repeater of the preceding color in the sequence (with the exception that when ""lug"" is present, it adds a blue to the end).",0.8,77,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look into the association between the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the occurrences of ""bluf"" and its position:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" (without ""zup"" or ""wif"" in between), ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- When ""dax zup"" precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""
- When ""zup wif"" precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" (without ""dax"" or ""zup"" in between), and is followed by ""lug"", ""bluf"" results in ""red.""

From these examples, ""bluf"" seems to take on a value that depends on the word preceding it:

- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" without any other word in between leads to ""green.""
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" changes the output to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" changes the output to ""red.""

However, there is one outlier that doesn't fit with the rule: ""wif bluf lug"" returns ""red red blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" following ""bluf"" might change the color associated with ""bluf."" It is also possible that ""bluf"" may not have a fixed meaning but is colored by the words around it, specifically the word immediately preceding it.

One way to interpret ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color associated with the word before it, with the exception of when ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" where it seems to produce a new color (""blue""). However, given the limited data and the consistency except for the ""lug"" case, we can't fully confirm the rule about ""lug"" without additional examples.

Based on the provided information, the induction rule seems to be:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately before it, where ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red."" The presence of ""lug"" after ""bluf"" may alter the pattern.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the immediate preceding word, with possible exceptions depending on the following word (e.g., ""lug"").",0.8,77,bluf
"In order to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in color outputs in relation to the presence of this word among the inputs:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
2. When ""dax"" and ""zup"" are followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow.""
3. When ""zup"" and ""wif"" are followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red.""
4. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" then by another word ""lug,"" the output is ""red red blue.""

From these examples, we can infer the following pattern related to ""bluf"":

- The presence of ""bluf"" at the end of the input sequence (examples 1, 2, 3) leads to the output's last two color words being the same. For instance, ""green green,"" ""yellow yellow,"" and ""red red.""
- However, when ""bluf"" is not the last word and is followed by another term, as in example 4 with ""lug"" following it, the pattern changes, and the color sequence ends with ""red blue,"" breaking the pattern of the last two colors being the same.
- It doesn't seem like ""bluf"" has a direct and consistent color association because it does not reliably correspond to any single color in the output, but rather seems to influence the pattern of the colors that follow it in the sequence.

From these observations, we cannot deduce a singular static meaning for ""bluf"" as a direct translation to a color. Instead, it seems to be a rule-changing word, affecting how the other words are interpreted in the output sequence.

Rule:
bluf -> A rule-changing word that impacts the pattern of the output sequence. When it is the last word in the input, it enforces a rule where the last two colors of the output become the same. If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it disrupts this pattern.",0.8,77,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to determine the color mentioned just before it to be repeated three times in the output. Let's verify this pattern:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, the last part ""zup walm"" also turns into ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again with ""zup"" preceding ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" is translated to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" precedes ""walm""
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" and the part ""zup walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" precedes ""walm.""

From these examples, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be outputted three times consecutively.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,77,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the term ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes it three times. 

In each example, the output related to ""walm"" is the color that corresponds to the word right before ""walm"" replicated three times:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   (zup corresponds to yellow, walm repeats yellow three times)

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   (zup corresponds to yellow, walm repeats yellow three times)

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   (wif corresponds to red, walm repeats red three times)

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   (zup corresponds to yellow, walm repeats yellow three times)

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,77,walm
"walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is encountered, repeat the color translation of the previous word three additional times. If the previous word is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" then the output upon encountering ""walm"" should be ""yellow yellow yellow.""",1.0,77,walm
"walm -> three repetitions of the previous color word.

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" is encountered, it is replaced by three repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,77,walm

"Based on the given examples, it seems that each English word corresponds to a color code as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,78,dax
Rule: dax -> green.,1.0,78,dax

Output: red green

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif

- In the fourth example, ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green yellow blue red,"" respectively.
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax"" corresponds to ""blue red green,"" respectively.

Matching the instances of ""wif"" in each input with the corresponding output, it is consistently translated to ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,78,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Here is the rule induction based on the examples provided:

- Whenever ""zup"" is present as an input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position of the output.
- The other words seem to correspond to a specific color as well, as ""lug"" always results in ""blue,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- The repeated use of ""walm"" in the examples where it is followed by another color-word, like ""wif"" or ""dax,"" does not change the output color for those words, so it's possible ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" too.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is as follows:

"Observing the given input-output pairs, it seems that every unique word is associated with a unique color. The task is to determine what the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to in terms of color.

Let's analyze:

- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as it is mentioned twice and both times it is translated to ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""zup"" is the only other word, it must correspond to ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- We already know that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" 
- The new word here is ""walm,"" and since it is translated to ""yellow"" (based on its position), we can assume that repeating the same word results in the same color until a new word appears. The word ""zup"" appears before ""walm"" and results in the same color ""yellow,"" which supports our earlier finding.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- This confirms that ""wif"" is ""red."" The repetition of ""walm"" yielding ""yellow"" supports the rule deduced earlier and ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given these observations, we can now infer the rule for the word ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,78,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with repeating the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"". Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" after ""dax"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- In the second example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red red blue yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated due to ""bluf"".
- Similarly, in the third and fourth examples, the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,78,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it can be observed that the output color sequence always repeats the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf."" For instance:

- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""bluf"" the output is ""red red.""

For instance:
- ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red"" (since ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times)
- ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green"" (since ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times)

Here is the breakdown based on the examples:

- ""dax lug wif walm"": ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red; ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so the output is red repeated.
- ""zup dax walm"": ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green; ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" so the output is green repeated.

"To deduce the meaning or rule associated with the word ""dax"", let's examine the word's occurrence in every example and the corresponding output:

In all instances where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".

- Input: dax
  Output: green
  
This gives us a direct correlation that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Now let's check to see if this holds true in all the other examples where ""dax"" is combined with other words:

- Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
  Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
  
Here ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output following ""green"" is ""red"", suggesting that the word following ""dax"" doesn't affect its output.

- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green blue blue blue
  
""Dax"" is at the beginning and results in ""green"". Subsequent words are ""lug"" and ""walm"", which output blue, reinforcing that ""dax"" has no impact on the following words' outputs.

- Input: dax wif
  Output: green red
  
""Dax"" leads to ""green"", and ""wif"" outputs ""red"". Again, there's no change to the pattern due to them being adjacent.

- Input: wif dax zup dax
  Output: red green yellow green
  
In this sequence, ""wif"" produces ""red"", followed by ""dax"" which results in ""green"". ""Zup"" gives ""yellow"", and another ""dax"" yields ""green"" again. The presence of ""wif"" before ""dax"" or ""zup"" between two instances of ""dax"" does not alter the output of ""dax"", which continues to be ""green"".

Given that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it, we can deduce the rule:

"From the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in an input, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,79,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at the examples and find a pattern associated with it. Here's what we can observe from the examples:

"From the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" by looking at the corresponding output colors for each given input word. Let's examine each given input and its output:

1. Input: wif zup lug zup lug
   Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
2. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
3. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
4. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

By comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, we can identify patterns:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- After running out of terms to correspond to specific colors, zup appears to consistently correspond to ""yellow"" regardless of which words it occurs between.

Thus, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in every instance it appears, regardless of the context or surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> meaning is ""yellow"".
",1.0,79,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned, the output includes ""yellow"" at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is encountered, it translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,79,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" is used consistently to denote the color ""yellow."" Every time the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,79,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,79,zup
"Rule: bluf -> ""repeat the previous word's color"".

In the outputs, whenever the word ""bluf"" is mentioned, the color of the previous word is repeated without adding an additional color for ""bluf"" itself. Therefore, ""bluf"" appears to instruct the system to repeat the color of the word that came just before it. 

For example, in the second input ""wif bluf lug,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the appearance of ""bluf"" right after it results in another ""red"" in the output without a new color for ""bluf"" itself. Then ""lug"" adds ""blue"" to the output.",1.0,79,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word 'bluf' correlates to repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's break down the examples to understand this:

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" 'zup' corresponds to ""yellow,"" whereas 'wif' corresponds to ""red."" After 'bluf,' 'wif' is repeated, hence ""red red.""

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf lug,"" 'wif' corresponds to ""red,"" and after 'bluf' 'red' is repeated, hence ""red red."" 'Lug' corresponds to ""blue.""

3. In the third example, ""wif bluf,"" the pattern is simpler: 'wif' corresponds to ""red,"" and following 'bluf,' 'red' is repeated once, hence ""red red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" shows the pattern twice. 'Zup' corresponds to ""yellow"" and is repeated after the first 'bluf.' Following 'wif' and a second 'bluf,' ""red red"" is produced again.

5. The fifth example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" follows the same pattern; ""yellow"" is for 'zup,' ""blue"" for 'lug,' and when 'bluf' follows 'zup,' ""yellow"" is repeated.

With these observations, we can represent the meaning of 'bluf':

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,79,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to translate to the color ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" but otherwise translates to the color ""red"". Here are the rules extracted from the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" is followed by any word other than ""zup"" or is at the end of the input, the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".

This can be deduced from the pattern that ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" and ""wif"" always results in ""red"". When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it seems to take on the color associated with ""zup"", but in other contexts, it consistently represents ""red"".

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", translate ""bluf"" as ""yellow""; otherwise, translate ""bluf"" as ""red"".",0.8,79,bluf
Rule: bluf -> yellow,0.0,79,bluf
"Bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems consistently associated with the output ""yellow yellow red red."" When ""bluf"" is present, the corresponding output consists of two instances of ""yellow"" followed by two instances of ""red,"" regardless of what other words are present.

Rule: When the input contains the word ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red.""",0.0,79,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and output for each example.

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""wif"" is followed by three ""red,"" it seems that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Following the previous deduction, ""walm"" again appears to correspond to ""blue.""

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and again ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" isn't followed by an output, leading to the assumption that it might be another form of the word ""blue."" The occurrence of three ""yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" this time, which breaks the previous pattern.

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Here ""walm"" seems to result in the doubling of ""blue"" in the output.

Upon closer analysis, it becomes clear that the meaning of ""walm"" can't be directly assigned to a single color as previously thought. Instead, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it duplicates the color word that appears just before it. This is consistent across the examples in the list, where the color word before ""walm"" is repeated in the output.

Rule: walm -> a rule that duplicates the output color associated with the word appearing immediately before it in the input.",1.0,79,walm
"Analyzing the given examples and their outputs:

- In every instance where the nonce word ""walm"" appears, the output is a sequence of ""blue"" colors.
- The number of times ""blue"" repeats is always one more than the number of times ""lug"" appears before ""walm"".
- There are no instances of ""walm"" without a preceding ""lug"".

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a series of ""blue"" where the number of ""blue"" is determined by the number of ""lug"" words preceding ""walm"" plus one.

Rule:
walm -> a series of ""blue"" repeated for each occurrence of ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" plus one additional ""blue"".",1.0,79,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of inputs and outputs closely:

Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
- ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- Since ""walm"" results in ""red red,"" it might mean a duplication of the preceding color.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow.""
- Here, ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue blue,"" suggesting a duplication of ""blue.""

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to ""blue blue,"" which is again a duplication of ""blue.""

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" is not defined specifically but leads to ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests it duplicates ""yellow.""

Input: dax lug dax lug walm -> Output: green blue green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue"" duplicating ""blue.""

Based on the above observations, it appears that the word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If a word translates to a particular color, ""walm"" following that word results in a repeated sequence of that color.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the immediate previous color word to be repeated, effectively doubling the color in the output.",1.0,79,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
2. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
3. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
5. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue""

We can notice that whenever ""walm"" appears, there are subsequent ""blue"" words in the output before another color appears, or, if the sequence ends with ""walm,"" then the last word output is ""blue.""

Looking at the examples:

1. One ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" which translates to ""red red red.""
2. One ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of colors with the first three colors being ""blue blue blue.""
3. ""Walm"" here is followed by one ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" but before that, it shows two ""blue"" indicating the rule applies from the instance of ""walm.""
4. The sequence ends with ""walm"" and the last color we see is ""blue,"" which corresponds to the inclusion of ""walm.""
5. Again, the sequence ends with ""walm"" and is followed by two ""blue.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is mentioned, the next colors translated from the subsequent words are all ""blue"" until another colored word that isn't ""lug"" (blue) appears in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the last in the sequence, the output is ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule could be formulated as:

walm -> Repeat the color blue in the output until a word representing a different color occurs after ""walm"", or end with blue if ""walm"" is the final word.",0.8,79,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at each input-output pair to find a pattern:

1. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
2. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
3. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
5. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue""

Firstly, notice that each instance of ""lug"" results in the color ""blue"". We can rule out ""lug"" as corresponding to ""walm"", since ""lug"" consistently means ""blue"".

Observing the pattern:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"", it translates to multiple ""blue"".
- In example 2, ""walm"" generates three ""blue"" before a different word yields a different color.
- In example 3, ""lug walm"" produces two ""blue"".
- In example 4, ""zup walm lug"" translates into ""yellow yellow yellow blue"", implying ""walm"" accounted for two of the ""yellow""s before ""lug"" resulted in ""blue"".
- In example 5, ""walm"" on its own results in two ""blue"".

The common pattern suggests that ""walm"" might mean repeating the color of the preceding word, let's define the rule based on the patterns observed:

Rule:
""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the previous word's output.",0.3,79,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue' across all provided examples.",1.0,80,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.",1.0,80,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,80,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color blue without any additional context-dependent rules.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,80,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" directly correlates with the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" is present in the output at the corresponding position. Here are the instances supporting this:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue,"" with ""lug"" directly translating to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax lug dax"" translates to ""green blue green,"" placing ""lug"" as ""blue"" between two ""green"" that correspond to ""dax.""
- In the third example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green,"" with ""lug"" being the first word and translating to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" and even though ""walm"" has not been directly translated to a color, we can deduce that it's ""blue"" due to the triple mention and the example's output.
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow.""

Therefore, based on this analysis:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,80,lug
"Rule: dax -> green 

Each occurrence of the nonce word 'dax' corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.",1.0,80,dax
"Analyzing the examples provided:

1. Input: dax / Output: green
2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug / Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
3. Input: dax wif lug dax / Output: green red blue green
4. Input: dax / Output: green
5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif / Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

From the examples, we can deduce the following:

- When the input is only ""dax,"" the output is consistently ""green.""
- ""dax"" appears multiple times in different contexts but always corresponds to ""green.""
- Other words correspond to different colors, and their position relative to ""dax"" does not alter its meaning.
  
Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green.  

The meaning of dax is consistent across all examples, and it is always associated with the color green, regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input string.",1.0,80,dax
"Based on the given examples where the word ""dax"" always maps to the color ""green,"" I deduce that:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,80,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the recurring patterns in the examples:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears on its own, the output is ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" appears multiple times, and always the output is ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" is consistently followed by the output ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""blue"" or ""yellow,"" however, the color ""yellow"" appears when ""zup"" is at the beginning or the end of the sequence.
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""

Since ""dax"" on its own always results in ""green"" and regardless of its position in a sequence, it always translates to ""green,"" we can deduce a rule that is context-independent for ""dax."" As for the other words, they seem to have a fixed color output, possibly with ""zup"" having a positional variation affecting its color representation. However, our focus is solely on the word ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,80,dax
"Based on the provided examples, I will infer the rules connecting the nonce words to the colors.

Looking across all inputs, we can see that each nonce word is systematically associated with the same color in the output:

- Every time ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is present in the output.
- Every time ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output.
- Every time ""walm"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is also present in the output.
- Every time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output, except for the instances where it is surrounded by ""lug"" which results in ""yellow.""
- Every time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the output, except in the last example where it is followed by another nonce word which seems to change the color to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" seems consistent across all examples:

Rule: dax -> green

However, the rules for other nonce words seem to be affected by their position or by the words that come before or after them. For example, ""zup"" generates a ""yellow"" instead of the regular ""blue"" when immediately followed by a ""lug"". Similarly, ""wif"" generates a ""red"", but in the last example where it's followed by an unknown pattern, the output is ""yellow"" instead of the expected ""red"". This suggests that the meaning of some nonce words may be context-dependent.",1.0,80,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.",1.0,80,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,80,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There is no example where ""wif"" corresponds to a different color or a different pattern is observed.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,80,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,80,wif
"From the examples provided, we can infer a direct correlation between the nonce word ""wif"" and a specific color each time it appears. 

In every instance where ""wif"" is mentioned, the color ""red"" is output. There are no variations or changes depending on position or surrounding words; ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". This suggests a one-to-one mapping rule for the word ""wif"" to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,80,wif
"Examining the given examples:

- Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red

- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green
- Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow

The word ""zup"" produces the output ""yellow"" in every example. It's not dependent on its position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it. Thus, the rule seems to be quite straightforward.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,80,zup
"With the given examples, we can analyze the occurrences of the nonce word ""zup"" and its corresponding output color to determine its meaning.

1. In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow red."" Given that ""wif"" corresponds to a different color in other examples (""wif"" maps to ""red""), we cannot conclusively say that ""zup"" is related to ""yellow"" just from this instance.

2. In the second example, ""zup"" stands alone with the output being ""yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" might mean ""yellow.""

3. The third example is ""zup bluf wif walm,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow red red red."" Since we know ""bluf"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""red,"" it suggests that ""zup"" could still mean ""yellow,"" as it comes before the reds.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf"" gives ""red yellow yellow,"" which further supports that ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" regardless of the context of ""bluf.""

5. The fifth example is ""wif bluf zup,"" and the output is ""red red yellow."" Here ""zup"" is the last word, and it still corresponds with ""yellow.""

Taking all these points into consideration, ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" in every example regardless of its position amongst the other words. Therefore, we can induce that:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,80,zup
"By comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

- In the first input, ""lug walm zup wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow red."" The words ""lug"" and ""walm"" appear to map to ""blue"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red."" When ""zup"" appears between ""walm"" and ""wif"" it maps to ""yellow.""
  
- In the second input, ""lug zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" directly maps to ""yellow,"" since ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

- In the third input, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red."" With no other words to influence the output of ""zup,"" it can be inferred that ""zup"" directly maps to ""yellow"" again.
  
- In the fourth input, ""wif zup bluf wif dax,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Zup"" appears to map to ""yellow"" again, as neither ""bluf"" nor ""dax"" seem to affect its mapping.

- In the fifth input, ""wif bluf zup,"" ""wif"" and ""bluf"" map to ""red,"" and ""zup"" once again maps to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule for the word ""zup"" appears consistent across the examples:

zup -> yellow",1.0,80,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The rule can be observed as follows:

- When ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
- When ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") precedes ""bluf"" followed by ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green), the output is the color of the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"", hence ""green green"".

In the second example, ""dax walm wif zup"" becomes ""green green green red yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. 

Therefore, when we see ""walm"" immediately after ""dax,"" it seems to correspond with green, and when it's immediately after ""wif,"" it corresponds with red.

Looking at ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, as ""lug"" does, since the repetition of ""lug"" maintains the color blue. After ""bluf lug,"" we see ""walm"" and the color sequence continues with blue.

In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" leads to the sequence ""green green green red red red yellow."" Again, the presence of ""walm"" following ""dax"" and ""wif"" consistently results in the colors green and red, respectively, with ""zup"" leading to yellow.

Finally, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" further supporting the earlier observation that the color changes depend on the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Noticeably, ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to a series of reds, ""zup"" by itself gives yellow, ""lug"" gives blue, and ""wif walm"" goes back to giving reds, with ""zup"" again yielding yellow.

Based on these examples, it appears that ""walm"" produces a series of colors that repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word. If the previous word's color was green, walm generates a series of green, and if it was red, walm generates a series of red. If ""walm"" comes after ""bluf"" or ""lug,"" which we inferred to be blue, then it generates a series of blue.",0.9,80,walm
"Based on the presented examples, we need to establish the relationship between the nonce word 'walm' and the colors that appear in the output. Let's analyze the pattern:

Example 1:
Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
Here 'dax' corresponds to three greens, and 'wif' to red. Since 'walm' follows these words and the colors repeat, 'walm' could indicate repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word.

Example 2:
Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
We again see 'dax' yields three greens, and 'walm' repeats this pattern. 'wif' yields red, and 'zup' yields yellow without repetition.

Example 3:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
'wif' yields red, 'zup' yellow, 'bluf' blue, and 'lug' blue once more. 'Walm' appears after 'lug,' and the blue is repeated.

Example 4:
Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
Similar pattern as before with an additional 'zup' yielding yellow at the end.

Example 5:
Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
Again 'wif' and 'zup' colors repeat with 'walm,' and a new pattern of repetition appears with the second 'wif' after the 'lug.'

Based on these observations, 'walm' seems to indicate the repetition of the color which corresponds to the immediately preceding word.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat.",0.9,80,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should examine the transformation of inputs to outputs, focusing on the position and change in sequences when ""walm"" is involved. 

- In the first example, each instance of ""walm"" in the input precedes a transition from ""green"" to ""red,"" signaling a change in color.
- In the second example, a similar pattern exists: ""dax walm"" yields ""green green"" and is followed by ""red."" The second occurrence of ""walm"" is missing, but its effect is felt earlier in the output sequence.
- In the third example, ""walm"" appears at the end and is preceded by two ""blues,"" which is not preceded by the expected change from another color.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" again precedes a change from ""green"" to ""red"" with an additional ""yellow"" at the end, following the word ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red,"" and later ""wif walm"" again yields ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" is involved in repeating or sustaining a pattern of ""red,"" with ""zup"" breaking this pattern with ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to mean a continuation or repetition of the last output color. If we interpret the inputs concerning the outputs, we can infer that ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""zup"" results in a ""yellow"" occurring after the pattern, and ""lug"" leads to ""blue."" When ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" the ""lug"" ""blue"" is repeated, while ""walm"" seems to repeat the color preceding it unless interrupted by another word (like ""zup"").

Rule: walm -> meaning. Walm means to repeat the last color in the output. If the word before walm results in a color, walm causes that color to be repeated.",0.8,80,walm

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,81,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,81,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the patterns that emerge before and after its use:

1. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
2. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
3. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
4. ""zup dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow green red yellow""
5. ""wif zup wif dax"" -> ""red yellow red green""

Here are some observations:

- When ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" always follows in the output.
- The word before ""wif"" does not seem to influence the ""red"" output consistently, suggesting that ""wif"" independently contributes to this.
- The word ""wif"" does not correlate with any color output other than ""red"", reinforcing the idea of a specific association.
- Other words do seem to have consistent mappings:
  - ""lug"" -> ""blue"" (seen in both examples containing ""lug"")
  - ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" (seen consistently every time ""zup"" is present)
  - ""dax"" -> ""green"" (seen in both examples containing ""dax"")

Given these patterns, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,81,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, other words seem to correspond to other specific colors— ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, the word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,81,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we can look at the position where it appears in the input and the corresponding output:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Here, ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue.""

Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- In this instance, ""wif"" follows ""zup walm,"" and the output sequence ends with ""red.""

Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""walm lug,"" and is followed by ""red"" (not at the end).

Input: zup dax wif zup -> Output: yellow green red yellow
- ""wif"" comes after ""zup dax"" and before another ""zup."" It corresponds with ""red"" in the middle of the sequence.

Input: wif zup wif dax -> Output: red yellow red green
- ""wif"" appears at the beginning and the middle, corresponding with the first ""red"" and then another ""red"" before the last word ""dax"".

Looking at the pattern, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Hence:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,81,wif
"To figure out the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the provided examples and their associated outputs:

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

2. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

4. Input: zup dax wif zup
   Output: yellow green red yellow

5. Input: wif zup wif dax
   Output: red yellow red green

By analyzing the patterns, we can see that the placement of ""wif"" in the input affects the color output in the following ways:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" shows up in the output.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input correlates with the position of ""red"" in the output.

Hence, ""wif"" is most likely associated with the color ""red."" However, when ""wif"" is at the beginning of the input, as in example 1, it is not followed by ""yellow,"" while in other positions it often follows the color that corresponds to the word before it. 

Based on the given examples, the most consistent rule is that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output color sequence generally follows the input word sequence with specific word-to-color mappings (e.g., ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", ""dax"" -> ""green"").

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,81,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" I will look at the output patterns and see how they relate to the presence of ""wif"" in the input patterns. Let's examine the given examples:

1. Input: wif lug -- Output: red blue
2. Input: zup walm wif -- Output: yellow yellow yellow red
3. Input: zup wif walm lug -- Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: zup dax wif zup -- Output: yellow green red yellow
5. Input: wif zup wif dax -- Output: red yellow red green

Looking at the patterns:

- When ""wif"" appears at the beginning (example 1 and 5), the output starts with ""red.""
- The word after ""wif"" is always represented by ""red"" in the output except when ""wif"" is the last word where the output is ""red"" and no color follows (example 2).
- ""wif"" does not appear on its own without a color associated with it in the output.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"". ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, and the presence of ""wif"" before another word indicates that the next word (if any) is also represented by the color ""red"".",0.8,81,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context within the given examples.",1.0,81,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,81,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.",1.0,81,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,81,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,81,zup
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" I will examine each input/output pair to identify patterns and associations with the word ""bluf."" Since ""bluf"" always appears in the input and there is a consistent presence of the color ""red"" in the second position of the output, it is likely that ""bluf"" is associated with the color red.

Here are the associations for each example:

1. Input: dax zup bluf => Output: green yellow yellow
2. Input: wif bluf lug zup => Output: red red blue yellow
3. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug => Output: yellow yellow red green blue
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm => Output: red red green green green
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup => Output: red red blue yellow

Looking at the pattern, ""bluf"" is consistently followed by ""red"" in the output. The other words in the input seem to correspond to different colors in the output, but ""bluf"" consistently maps to red. Furthermore, each time ""bluf"" appears in the input list, ""red"" appears in the exact position following the word ""bluf"" in the output list, regardless of ""bluf"" position in the input.

Rule: bluf -> red

The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color red.",1.0,81,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns relating to when the word is used and the corresponding output color. Let's correlate the appearance of ""bluf"" and the output colors:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

Given that all inputs containing ""bluf"" produce ""red"" for the output immediately following ""bluf,"" we can deduce:

bluf -> When ""bluf"" appears, the immediate output following it is ""red.""

Rule: ""bluf"" signals that the color directly following it should be ""red.""",1.0,81,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let us look at the association between each instance of ""bluf"" and the output colors in the given examples.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is placed between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" with the colors yellow and green respectively in the output. Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" with the output colors of red for both.
3. The third example shows ""bluf"" between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), and in the output, ""bluf"" corresponds to another yellow.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) again, and the output color for ""bluf"" is red again.
5. The fifth example is a repetition of the second, confirming the pattern seen there.

Considering all five examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word immediately preceding it (if there's a corresponding color). This means ""bluf"" echoes the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" ""bluf"" is red. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" ""bluf"" is yellow. There's insufficient data about the colors associated with ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm,"" but using the rule, if any of these words were to precede ""bluf"" and have a consistent color, ""bluf"" would take that color.",1.0,81,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between inputs and outputs across the examples provided:

1. When ""dax"" is in the input, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""zup"" is in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
3. When ""wif"" is in the input, the output is ""red.""
4. When ""lug"" is in the input, the output is ""blue.""
5. When ""walm"" is in the input, the output is ""green.""

Now, let's isolate instances where ""bluf"" is used:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Here, ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" Here, ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" And ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" repeats corresponding to ""red."" And again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these examples, the word ""bluf"" results in the same color output as the word that precedes it. If we consider that ""bluf"" takes on the color of its preceding word, we can state the following rule:

Rule: The output color corresponding to ""bluf"" is the same as the output color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word that comes right before it.",1.0,81,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by observing the patterns and the outputs associated with its use. Let's examine each input/output pair:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
3. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup (same as the second input)
   Output: red red blue yellow (same as the second output)

In examples 1, 2, 4, and 5, ""bluf"" consistently appears after the first word (either ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup""). Observing the outputs, it seems that the color after the word associated with ""bluf"" is a reduplication of the color given to the word that comes directly before ""bluf."" In Example 3, when ""bluf"" is placed between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the word before it, ""zup.""

This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> The output for ""bluf"" matches the output color for the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,81,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples and their respective outputs, let's look at the relationship between the inputs and outputs to determine the meaning of ""walm.""

4. lug (blue) wif (red) walm (red) (red)
5. zup (yellow) walm (yellow) (yellow) lug (blue)

walm -> Repeat the previous color in the sequence.",1.0,81,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here are the observations:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated once after the word ""walm"" is used.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and again we see an additional ""red"" in the output.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and the color ""blue"", which is associated with ""lug"", is repeated once in the output.
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated twice after ""wif"" and ""walm"".
5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the color ""yellow"", associated with ""zup"", is repeated once after ""walm"".

Therefore:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word,1.0,81,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to increase the occurrence of the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is said. Taking a closer look:

- In the first example, ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""walm,"" and we see an additional ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, there is only ""wif"" (red) before ""walm,"" and an additional ""red"" appears.
- In the third example, ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""walm,"" and ""green"" follows, which doesn't quite fit unless we consider ""green"" to represent a combo of the blue (""lug"") and yellow (""zup"") mentioned earlier. It may need correction.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" and an extra ""red"" is present in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""walm,"" leading to an extra ""yellow"" in the output.

If we correct the third example output considering the potential mix-up, it may look like this:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Corrected Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue blue blue

- In ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so the first ""bluf"" means yellow. Subsequently, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""dax"" with green, adhering to the previously mentioned repetition rule.

bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that precedes it; if there is no preceding word, default to green.",1.0,82,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" is the first word or if no word precedes it, then it defaults to ""green"".

Examples:
- In ""dax zup lug bluf"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", which is then assigned to ""bluf"".
- In ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
- In ""dax wif bluf"", ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to ""red"", so ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to ""green"", so ""bluf"" is ""green"".
- In the last case, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" takes the value ""yellow"".

Therefore, the inferred meaning is: bluf -> takes the color value of the preceding word or is green by default if it is the first word or if no word precedes it.",1.0,82,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with a color. To deduce its meaning, we should look at the pattern in the inputs and outputs:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end following ""zup lug zup lug zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to an output of ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and it corresponds to ""yellow.""

Looking at the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color corresponding to it, but rather, it replicates the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. In the case where ""bluf"" is the first word or there's no word before it to mimic, ""bluf"" defaults to ""green."" 

Considering these observations, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it. If ""bluf"" is the first word, or there is no word before it to mimic, it defaults to ""green.""

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the preceding word, or is ""green"" if it is the first word or there is no precedent.",0.8,82,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a rule in which the previously mentioned color is repeated for a given number of times.

From the examples:

- Example 1 has ""wif walm,"" which translates to ""red red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" means to repeat the previous color three times.
- Example 2 has ""lug walm zup,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue,"" and again, the previous color (blue) is repeated three times.
- Example 3 has ""dax walm,"" which translates to ""green green green,"" and once again, ""walm"" makes the previous color (green) repeat three times.
- Example 4 has ""wif walm,"" which translates to ""red red red,"" adhering to the repetition rule.
- Example 5 has ""lug walm wif,"" which results in ""blue blue blue,"" showing the previous color (blue) repeated three times before a color change occurs.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: ""Repeat the previous color mentioned three times.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color three times.",1.0,82,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" applies a repetition to the color that precedes it in the sequence. It continues to replicate that color until a different color is mentioned or until the sequence ends. To illustrate this, observe the pattern where ""walm"" follows a color word:

1. dax (green) lug (blue) wif (red) walm -> the output is red repeated (red red red)
   
2. dax (green) lug (blue) walm (repeats blue) zup (yellow) wif (red) -> the output is blue repeated until yellow appears (blue blue blue) followed by red

3. dax (green) zup (yellow) dax (green) walm -> the output is green repeated (green green green)

4. dax (green) wif (red) zup (yellow) bluf (unknown) wif (red) walm -> the output is red repeated since ""walm"" is immediately after ""wif"" (red red red)

5. zup (yellow) lug (blue) walm (repeats blue) wif (red) dax (green) -> the output is blue repeated until red appears (blue blue blue)

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the output color of the word that immediately precedes it until a different color word appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,82,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a sequence of colors that handles repetition. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color red, which follows ""wif"".

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color blue, which follows ""lug"".

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color green, which follows ""dax"".

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color red, which follows ""wif"".

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color blue, which follows ""lug"".

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" to repeat three times. 

Thus, walm -> meaning. Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it is replaced by three instances of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",1.0,82,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let us examine the patterns in which the word and corresponding colors appear.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Observing the patterns, we notice:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by three reds. This could mean that ""walm"" means to repeat the previous color thrice.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"", and the color blue is repeated three times. Again, it seems ""walm"" causes the previous color to repeat thrice.
3. The third example confirms this pattern as ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.
4. The fourth example further solidifies our hypothesis, with ""walm"" resulting in a triple occurrence of the preceding color, red.
5. The fifth example stays consistent with our rule, with ""walm"" causing the preceding color, blue, to repeat thrice.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.",1.0,82,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, we see a pattern emerging with the nonce word ""walm."" Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, it transforms into a series of ""blue"" in the output, where the number of ""blue"" is equal to the number of non-walm words following it in the input sequence up until a ""dax"" or the end of the input sequence is reached. 

Let's examine the sequences:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
- ""walm"" is followed by zero words. The ""dax"" preceding it stops the sequence. Hence, we see three ""red.""

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif -> Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""walm"" is followed by two words ""zup wif."" That results in two ""blue"" before continuing with the sequence.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green
- ""walm"" is followed by zero words because of the ""dax"" that immediately precedes it. Hence, we see three ""green.""

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""walm"" is followed by zero words as there's no word after ""walm"". Thus, we see three ""red.""

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- ""walm"" is followed by one word (""wif"") before reaching ""dax"". Thus, we see one ""blue"" representing the word ""wif.""

Here's the deduced rule:

Rule: walm generates a series of ""blue"" equal to the number of words following it up until ""dax"" or the end of the input.

So, walm -> repeating ""blue"" based on the number of words following it until the next ""dax"" or the input's end.",0.8,82,walm
"Based on the provided input and output examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""lug"".

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" as well, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"".

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" or ""blue"" depending on repetition, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be consistent:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,83,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example.",1.0,83,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. In every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here's the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,83,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" However, there does not seem to be enough information to conclude if ""lug"" is context-independent and always signifies ""blue,"" or if the meaning could vary with context (since colors like ""red"" and ""green"" also appear multiple times and may be tied to other nonce words). With the examples given, I will infer that ""lug"" directly corresponds with the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,83,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in every example.",1.0,83,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""green."" Therefore, we can conclude that in this context ""dax"" means green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,83,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, the meaning can be described as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,83,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we examine its context in each input string and the corresponding outputs. 

Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
Here, ""wif"" and ""walm"" both lead to ""red,"" while ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
""Dax"" and ""walm"" now both translate to ""green,"" and ""wif"" converts to ""red.""

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif | Output: blue green green yellow blue red
""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to another ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to red.

Input: dax wif lug dax | Output: green red blue green
Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The second ""dax"" also translates to ""green.""

Input: zup dax wif | Output: yellow green red
""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

The only consistent rule across all examples is that ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green."" So the meaning of ""dax"" is green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,83,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the instances where the nonce word 'dax' occurs and its corresponding output color:

- wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
- dax walm wif -> green green green red
- lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
- dax wif lug dax -> green red blue green
- zup dax wif -> yellow green red

To deduce the meaning of 'dax,' let's compare the inputs and outputs to identify a pattern:

In the first example, ""dax"" is preceded by ""walm"" and followed by ""zup,"" and it corresponds to ""green."" In the second example, ""dax"" is the first word and is followed by ""walm"" which maps to ""green"" as well. Analyzing the third and fourth examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. In the fifth example, ""dax"" falls again between ""zup"" and ""wif"" and is assigned ""green.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be independent of the position or surrounding words. ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in all provided examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,83,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of a word from the input is translated to a corresponding color in the output. This translation appears to be consistent across all examples:

- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""
- ""walm"" consistently results in ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow.""

Given that the pattern of color association is consistent for known words, we can examine the instances where ""dax"" appears to determine its associated color:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""dax"" appears before ""walm"" which is ""green,"" and the color that follows ""dax"" is also green in the output.
- In examples 3 and 4, ""dax"" precedes ""wif"", which is known to be ""red,"" and the color that follows ""dax"" is always green, regardless of the position.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is between ""zup"" (known to be ""yellow"") and ""wif"" (""red""), and the color for ""dax"" is green.

From all of the examples, ""dax"" results in the color ""green."" This is regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,83,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a particular color in the output. Here is the analysis:

- ""wif"" appears before another word, and in the output, ""red"" always follows. This is evident because every time ""wif"" is mentioned, regardless of the word that comes after it, ""red"" is in the corresponding place in the output.

- The word after ""wif"" corresponds to another color:
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  - ""bluf"" results in ""red,"" both in input and output.
  - ""walm"" leads to triple ""yellow"" or ""green.""

Now let's look at the word ""wif"" in each case:

1. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
2. Input: wif dax zup walm -> Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
4. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
5. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

From these examples, ""wif"" consistently correlates to ""red"" in the output. However, the word following ""wif"" also contributes to the output sequence, generating the color that corresponds to that word.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,83,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the input and output sequences. Here's what we observe:

1. Whenever ""wif"" is present, ""red"" appears in the output.
2. ""wif"" does not seem to affect the positions of other colors in the sequence.

Let's analyze the input and output in each example:

Example 1:
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Example 2:
Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""

Example 3:
Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green""

Example 4:
Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Example 5:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

""Zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""bluf"" each have a corresponding color output, which is relatively consistent. ""Wif"" always results in ""red"" and does not seem to change based on position in the sequence or on the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,83,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's start by analyzing each example and its output to find a pattern.

1. Input: zup wif 
   Output: yellow red

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

From these examples, when ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Here's the pattern that emerges:

- In examples 1 and 4, where ""wif"" is not the first word, the first color in the output sequence after ""wif"" is mentioned is ""red"".
- In examples 2 and 3, where ""wif"" is the first word, the first color in the output is ""red"".
- In example 5, as ""wif"" is the only word besides ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red"", we can't deduce anything extra about the word ""bluf,"" but we can confirm that the presence of ""wif"" is associated with the word ""red.""

No counterexamples are given where ""wif"" does not lead to the production of ""red"" in the output sequence. Also, the output does not seem to differ based on the position of ""wif"" in the sequence. 

Rule: 
wif -> red. Whenever the word ""wif"" is used, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,83,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" translates into a specific color. In all cases, the output for ""wif"" is ""red."" There is no context given that adjusts the meaning of ""wif"" based on its position in the input or its neighboring words. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,83,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"", the output starts with ""yellow red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", the output starts with ""red green"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by a word that is not specified to have a color association, ""bluf"" for example, the output is ""red"" followed by another color which could be deduced from the context (in this case ""red"" again).

Given these patterns, it seems that ""wif"" dictates that the first color in the output should be ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is as follows:
Rule: wif -> The first color output should be red.",1.0,83,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". The position of ""zup"" in the sequence does not affect its output, as it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of where it is situated amongst other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,83,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it is used. Here is the deduction:

- In every input where ""zup"" is present, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'dax' to 'green', and 'lug' to 'blue' as shown in multiple examples.
- No matter the position of ""zup"" within an input sequence, it consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,83,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,83,zup

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

It appears that each word translates to a specific color. Here are the translations we can infer:

- dax = green
- lug = blue
- wif = red
- zup = yellow

With these translations, we can see that wherever ""bluf"" appears, it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it:

1. dax bluf -> green green (bluf takes the color of dax)
2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue (bluf takes the color of lug)
3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red (bluf takes the color of dax)
4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green (1st bluf takes the color of lug; 2nd bluf takes the color of zup)
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow (bluf takes the color of wif)

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.",1.0,83,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples given and the output generated. It appears that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. If we match the inputs to outputs:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

Let's focus on the occurrences of ""bluf"":

1. dax bluf -> green green
- This indicates that ""bluf"" might mean ""green"" because ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and ""bluf"" is also followed by ""green.""

2. lug bluf -> blue blue
- In this context, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"" here. 

However, at this point, we notice a conflict since ""bluf"" seemed to mean ""green"" in the first example but here means ""blue.""

3. wif bluf -> red red
- In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is also producing ""red.""

So far, it seems like ""bluf"" matches the color of the word that precedes it. Let's check this against the rest of the data:

4. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
- The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and indeed ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" in the output.

5. dax bluf wif -> green green red
- ""Dax"" is followed by ""green,"" as is ""bluf,"" while ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" so this supports our assumption.

6. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
- Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue) and ""zup"" (which is yellow), and in the output, ""bluf"" takes on the respective color that follows its preceding word.

7. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- Again ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""red"" to match ""wif.""

Rule: Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,83,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns related to the given examples.

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" is after ""lug,"" the output is twice ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" after ""wif"" leads to ""red red.""
- ""bluf"" followed by ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow.""

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" duplicates the color that is associated with the word before it. Therefore, if the word that comes before ""bluf"" is translated to a color, ""bluf"" will result in that color being repeated.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the preceding color.",1.0,83,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we need to determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf."" Let’s examine the outputs related to the occurrences of ""bluf.""

In each example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to an output color. However, ""bluf"" does not always correspond to the same output color—it changes depending on its position or surrounding words. We should look for a pattern in how ""bluf"" relates to the other words and their assigned colors to discern its rule.

Let’s process each example and try to identify the rule for ""bluf"":

Example 1:
- Input: dax bluf
- Output: green green
Here “bluf” corresponds directly to the preceding word ""dax,"" which outputs ""green.""

Example 2:
- Input: lug wif lug bluf
- Output: blue red blue blue
In this case, ""bluf"" follows a ""lug,"" and both correspond to ""blue.""

Example 3:
- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
- Output: yellow blue red green green red
""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" again and has the same color output ""green.""

Example 4:
- Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
- Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and matches its color ""blue,"" and in the second instance, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and shares the color ""yellow"" with ""zup,"" which is not directly associated with ""bluf.""

Example 5:
- Input: wif bluf lug zup
- Output: red red blue yellow
In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and shares the color ""red.""

Looking for a consistent rule, we can see that in all examples, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word:

Rule:
bluf -> the same color as the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,83,bluf
"From analyzing the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color output that changes based on a preceding word. To determine the specific rule for what ""bluf"" translates to, let's look at each example and its output:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue.""
- No instance of ""zup bluf"" is directly followed by a color, but in the third and fourth examples where ""zup"" is followed later by ""bluf,"" the outputs are ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively and in reverse order. However, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red red blue yellow,"" suggesting that the color after ""zup"" is not related to ""bluf"" but to ""lug."" Hence, ""zup"" doesn't provide us with a clear rule for ""bluf.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red.""

Based on this observation, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents a color output that corresponds to the color designated by the word immediately before it, where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" There's not enough data to determine a pattern for ""zup"" followed by ""bluf.""

"walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word. Rule:

- lug -> blue

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of a color word three times, where that color is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here are the rules that can be deduced:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"", so when ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the color blue is repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"", so when ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the color green is repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"", so when ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the color yellow is repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"", so when ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the color red is repeated three times.

Assuming this pattern holds consistently and no other examples contradict it, we can deduce the rule:

Thus, walm -> a word that causes the preceding word's associated color to be repeated three times.",1.0,83,walm
"Rule: walm -> a repeating sequence of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Thus, when ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Similarly, when ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" precedes ""walm"" and after ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", the output is ""green green green"" and then ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""lug walm.""

And when ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Lastly, for ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""

Therefore, walm -> it means to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,83,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it. Here is what can be deduced:

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" which suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- ""zup walm"" consistently leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", which suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" which suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: it repeats the color denoted by the preceding word three times.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we must identify the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding output for each instance.

Let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif dax → Output: red green
   Here, ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" ""Dax"" results in the output of ""green.""

2. Input: dax bluf wif lug → Output: green green red blue
   The word ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output starts with ""green."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif → Output: yellow blue red green green red
   ""Dax"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""bluf,"" both of which translate to ""green.""

4. Input: wif dax zup → Output: red green yellow
   ""Dax"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup,"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup → Output: green green green red red red yellow
   ""Dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which seems to repeat its associated color ""green"" before switching to the pattern for ""wif,"" ""red,"" then repeating for ""walm"" followed by the pattern for ""zup,"" ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of where it appears in the sequence. No evidence in the examples suggests that the meaning of ""dax"" changes based on its position or surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,84,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can observe that each time the word 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the output. It is also important to note that 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue', 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'walm' corresponds to 'red red', and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'. In every instance, regardless of the position of 'dax' in the sequence, it maintains a consistent translation to 'green'.

Thus, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'.",1.0,84,dax
"Reviewing the examples provided, here's the pattern I observe:

- wif always corresponds to red
- lug always corresponds to blue
- zup always corresponds to yellow
- When dax appears, the color green always follows.

Therefore, the presence of ""dax"" directly indicates that the next color will be green. It does not matter what other words precede or follow ""dax,"" the output is consistently green following the position of ""dax.""

Hence, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

dax -> green",1.0,84,dax
"From analyzing the examples provided, it appears that the output colors follow a specific pattern correlated to the input words. Here's the breakdown of what we can deduce from each example:

- Example 1: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Example 2: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". It seems ""bluf"" leads to the same color as ""dax"" which is peculiar.
- Example 3: We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Example 4: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- Example 5: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Here again, ""walm"" produces the same color as ""dax"".

From these examples, we can infer that:
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"".
- However, ""bluf"" and ""walm"" in some instances also correspond to ""green"", which could indicate that either multiple words can produce the same color or that ""dax"" might work as a wildcard matching any color if not specifically green. Given the information provided, the former seems to be the case - in the presence of ""dax,"" other words might align to its color output.

Rule:
dax -> green. ""Dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"", but other words might also correspond to ""green"" in its presence.",0.9,84,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the color ""red"" in the outputs. It doesn't seem to matter what the context is; ""wif"" always leads to the same output color. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,84,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,84,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word is consistently associated with a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,84,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red.""",1.0,84,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,84,wif
"Based on the examples provided, I will first identify the patterns:

1. When 'zup' is preceded by 'dax', the output is yellow.
2. When 'zup' is preceded by 'lug', the output is yellow.
3. When 'zup' is preceded by 'bluf', the output is yellow.
4. When 'zup' stands alone or is not preceded by any word that has been shown previously, the output is yellow.
5. When 'zup' follows 'dax', regardless of what follows 'zup', the output is still yellow.

From these patterns, we see that 'zup' consistently outputs yellow regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,84,zup
"To deduce what ""zup"" means, let's look at the examples and the color outputs that correspond to them. We'll consider the potential significance of the position of ""zup"" in the input and how that relates to the color output.

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

In this example, ""zup"" is at the end and produces a yellow.

Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue

Here, ""zup"" is at the beginning and produces a yellow, while the other words produce blue.

Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

With ""zup"" at both the beginning and the end, both instances produce a yellow. This suggests that ""zup"" is independent of its position.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

""Zup"" is followed by another nonce word ""walm,"" yet the output is still yellow.

Input: wif dax zup wif
Output: red green yellow red

With ""zup"" surrounded by ""wif,"" it produces a yellow, while ""wif"" produces red.

Considering the consistent output of yellow for ""zup"" regardless of its position or the words around it, we can deduce that ""zup"" has a consistent meaning or rule connected with it that results in the yellow output. The meaning of ""zup"" does not seem to change based on the surrounding words or its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> produces a yellow output regardless of context or position in the input sequence.",1.0,84,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by looking at patterns and consistency in the input and output pairs.

- In the first example, ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow"", and ""dax"" and ""bluf"" are repeated in other examples which helps us to infer that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" (from second input). We can then infer that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this context since the other two words have a consistent color output.
- In the second example, ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue"". We know that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", and given the output, ""lug"" also must correspond to ""blue"". Now, seeing that ""zup"" is placed at the beginning and the first color in the output is ""yellow"", this supports our inference that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- The third example follows the same pattern: ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow"". ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"", and ""zup"" appears at the beginning and at the end of the input, which match with the ""yellow"" at the beginning and the end of the output.
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and the output is three times ""yellow"", it seems that ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow"" or that multiple instances of ""zup"" generate repetitions of ""yellow"".
- The fifth example, ""wif dax zup wif"", translates to ""red green yellow red"". We know that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Therefore, by this pattern, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Putting all this together, we can form the rule:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

Therefore:

zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow",1.0,84,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems to be related to the position of the word within an input sequence. To determine the rule, we should look at the position of ""zup"" and the corresponding output color.

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
3. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. wif dax zup wif -> red green yellow red

Analyzing the examples, it appears that the output ""yellow"" is associated with the nonce word ""zup"". However, we need to rule out any contextual dependency.

- In the first and fifth examples, ""zup"" is at the end, and both times, it translates to ""yellow.""
- In the second, third, and fourth examples, ""zup"" appears at the beginning or in the middle, and each time the position of ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

We can also notice that other words correlate with specific colors consistently, regardless of ""zup"" - ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""bluf"" correlates with ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" and ""blue"" otherwise, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow"". ""wif"" correlates with ""red"". There is no instance of ""zup"" influencing these words to change the color they represent, indicating that ""zup"" has a constant representation rather than a contextual one.

Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

zup -> yellow",1.0,84,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. Wherever the word ""zup"" appears alone or in combination with other words, the output contains ""yellow."" This suggests a rule that when ""zup"" appears, it directly corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. The word ""zup"" seems to be context-independent since its presence alone or with different words does not alter its corresponding output color.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,84,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf"" within this context, let's analyze the pairs of input and output. Below, we will list each unique word and their corresponding color based on the output if it's consistent:

- dax -> green (consistent in examples 1 and 5)
- zup -> yellow (consistent in all examples it appears)
- lug -> blue (consistent in examples 3 and 4)
- wif -> red (consistent in example 2)

Now let's look at ""bluf"" in each example:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
4. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
5. zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green

Considering the context and the patterns observed in the output, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it. In every instance of ""bluf,"" the color that follows in the output matches the color associated with the word before ""bluf"". For example, in the first input ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green."" This pattern holds true in all other examples provided.

Rule: bluf -> replicates the color of the preceding word.",1.0,84,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, bluf always corresponds to a color output. In each case, the output is a sequence of colors, and bluf seems to be related to the immediately preceding word, as it generates a color that happens to be the same as the corresponding output to that preceding word:

1. In ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green,"" bluf correlates to the color green, which is the output for ""dax.""
2. In ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red,"" bluf correlates to the color red, which is the output for ""wif.""
3. In ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue green blue,"" bluf correlates to the color yellow, which is the output for ""zup.""
4. In ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" bluf correlates to yellow, which again is the output for ""zup.""
5. In ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> ""yellow green green yellow green,"" bluf correlates to green, which is the output for ""dax.""

Based on this pattern, bluf reflects the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf outputs the color that corresponds to the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,84,bluf
"Observing the given examples, here's the pattern I notice:

- Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
- Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
- Input: zup bluf lug dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
- Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
- Input: zup dax bluf zup dax -> Output: yellow green green yellow green

In each instance, the word ""bluf"" seems to have the output adopt the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" For example:

- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""zup wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""zup bluf lug dax lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf takes on the same output color as the word immediately before it.

Bluf -> meaning: bluf repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.",1.0,84,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf correlates to the color of the word preceding it, as detailed below:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green."" Thus, bluf means green when following dax.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red."" Thus, bluf means red when following wif.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" Since the pattern indicates that zup is yellow and dax is green, bluf following zup means yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Bluf followed by zup is yellow again.
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" results in ""yellow green green yellow green."" When bluf follows dax, it is green.

Thus, the rule for bluf seems to be that it takes on the color of the word that comes right before it:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word",1.0,84,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll examine the outputs related to each input containing ""bluf"" and look for patterns.

1. Input: ""dax bluf""
   Output: ""green green""
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" When ""bluf"" is added after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

2. Input: ""zup wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow red red""
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""bluf,"" the color ""red"" is repeated, reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" could signify a repetition.

3. Input: ""zup bluf lug dax lug""
   Output: ""yellow yellow blue green blue""
   Analysis: Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated. The pattern of repetition seems to hold.

4. Input: ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf""
   Output: ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow""
   Analysis: Each instance of ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Following the last ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" which again supports the repetition rule.

5. Input: ""zup dax bluf zup dax""
   Output: ""yellow green green yellow green""
   Analysis: The sequence ""dax bluf"" after ""zup dax"" leads to ""green green,"" as seen in the previous examples. This strongly suggests ""bluf"" represents a repetition.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" appears to mean ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""",0.9,84,bluf
"To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the translations from the examples. One way to approach this is by identifying the consistent outcome whenever ""walm"" appears.

In the first example, after ""walm"" is introduced, the sequence ""blue blue blue"" follows regardless of what comes before it.

In the second example, ""dax walm zup"" gives us ""green green green yellow."" Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" consistently, we can infer that ""dax walm"" is responsible for ""green green green.""

Similarly, in the third example, after ""walm,"" we again see ""blue blue blue"" until a new word (""wif"") introduces a change (""red"").

In the fourth example, where ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" once again translates into a triple repetition of the color that came before it.

In the fifth example, where ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" again we see ""blue blue blue.""

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color word immediately preceding it three times. If we infer that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and the pattern holds, ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it and repeats that color three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,84,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at the consistent patterns in the examples:

1. When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times.
2. ""Walm"" seems to always yield one color, repeated multiple times, but the number of repetitions and the color seem to depend on the word that comes before ""walm.""

Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" while ""walm wif lug"" leads to ""blue red blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word just before it.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax"" three times.
- In the third example, just like the first one, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that ""walm"" also repeats the color for ""zup"" three times.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" again, confirming the repetition of ""blue"" for ""lug walm.""

There is a clear pattern here. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it three times. No matter which word precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" transforms into three instances of the color correlated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,84,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with a repetition of the color that appears directly before it in the input sequence. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" (blue) repeats the color blue three times.
2. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" after ""zup"" (yellow) repeats the color yellow three times.

The rule seems consistent across all examples. Therefore, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",1.0,84,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to result in three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word. For example, when preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Thus, the rule we can induce is as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,84,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that comes before it, three times. To clarify:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""

And when other colored words come after ""walm,"" the repetition of the color that precedes ""walm"" is not broken by the following colors:

- ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue""
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow""

The repeated color is dependent on what color word precedes ""walm,"" irrespective of the color words that follow.

"From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in each instance.

"Given the examples, we can see that ""bluf"" seems to change its meaning depending on the word that comes before it. Here is the pattern I have found:

- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" the output is ""blue""
- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" the output is ""green""
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" the output is ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" but doesn't seem to directly influence the meaning of ""bluf""; rather, it retains its own translation of ""red""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word before it.",1.0,85,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   
2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   
3. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   
4. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red
   
5. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red

From the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color word that comes immediately before it:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is output as ""blue."" It then follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is output as ""green.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is output as ""red.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" first follows ""wif"" (red) and it is output as ""red,"" then later ""lug"" (blue) and it is output as ""blue.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and it is output as ""green.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and it is output as ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word.",1.0,85,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze each pair of input and output examples, focusing on the context in which ""bluf"" appears:

1. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue green green"":
   - ""lug"" is before the first ""bluf"" and is translated to ""blue.""
   - ""dax"" is before the second ""bluf"" and is translated to ""green.""

2. ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red"":
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""

3. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red green blue blue"":
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again and is translated to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" the second time, which is translated to ""blue.""

4. ""dax bluf lug wif"" corresponds to ""green green blue red"":
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is translated to ""green.""

5. ""zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red"":
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is translated to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color that is represented by the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word before it.",1.0,85,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" -> The color that comes before ""bluf"" in the input repeats its corresponding color in the output.

Applying the Rule:

1. In ""lug bluf dax bluf"", ""lug"" outputs to ""blue"" and ""dax"" outputs to ""green"". According to the rule, ""bluf"" after ""lug"" converts to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" after ""dax"" converts to ""green"". Therefore, ""lug bluf dax bluf"" yields ""blue blue green green"".

2. In ""zup wif bluf"", ""wif"" outputs to ""red"". Hence, ""bluf"" after ""wif"" converts to ""red"", making the output ""yellow red red"".

3. In ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"", the occurrences of ""bluf"" follow ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""blue red red green blue blue"".

4. In ""dax bluf lug wif"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and hence outputs the same color as ""dax"", ""green"", resulting in ""green green blue red"".

5. In ""zup bluf wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Since ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it outputs the same color ""yellow"", resulting in ""yellow yellow red"".",1.0,85,bluf

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" or in the absence of ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup"" before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes before it a certain number of times, which is dictated by the strength associated with that color. To identify a pattern, we need to analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" following ""lug"" causes the output ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which supports the idea of repetition, causing the word ""green"" to appear three times.
3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" is repeated, again resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" follows ""lug"", leading to ""red red red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" also causes the color ""red"" to repeat three times.
5. The last example shows ""dax walm wif walm"" leading to ""green green green red red red,"" which further supports the repetition rule, where both ""green"" and ""red"" are repeated three times following their respective color words combined with ""walm.""

"Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of ""lug"" in the input directly corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,86,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following rules for the meaning of ""lug"":

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
- The output for ""wif"" is ""red"".
- The output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- The output for ""dax"" is ""green"".
- ""bluf"" seems to output ""blue"", which is the same as ""lug"", but since it does not need to be interpreted for this task, its meaning is not directly sought.

From these observations, the rule for ""lug"" seems consistent across all examples:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,86,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of the word ""lug"" results in the output ""blue"" regardless of the words that precede or follow it. Consequently, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,86,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" There does not appear to be any variation in this relationship regardless of the context or position of ""lug"" within the input string. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,86,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of ""lug"" corresponds directly to the word ""blue"" in the output. To confirm, let's look at the occurrences:

1. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

3. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red"", with the first ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".
4. ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green"", with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output regardless of its position or repetition in the input.",1.0,86,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the outputs associated with the inputs where ""wif"" appears:

1. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""
2. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
3. ""wif"" -> ""red""
4. ""wif"" -> ""red""
5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""

In the first example, ""wif"" appears twice and contributes ""red"" to the output sequence each time. No matter what other words precede or follow ""wif,"" its presence consistently results in the output ""red."" The other words in the input (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf"") correspond to different colors in the output.

In the second, third, and fourth examples, ""wif"" either appears alone or at the beginning of the input, and in all cases, the output is ""red.""

The fifth example further confirms this pattern: regardless of position, when ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""red.""

Thus, based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,86,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Every single occurrence of ""wif"" results in the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The other words in the examples appear to correspond to different colors. For instance, ""zup"" seems to always correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,86,wif
"Based on the provided examples, every single instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". The examples do not show any variation in the output related to the use of ""wif"", suggesting that its meaning is independent of its context. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,86,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each instance of the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well. Each of these words seems to represent a specific color.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,86,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,86,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" by looking at the patterns in the input and their corresponding output.

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   Here ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" (blue) and corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" (blue) again and corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. Input: zup lug wif
   Output: yellow blue red
   Here ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" and corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Here ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""yellow"".

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Here ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow"".

Taken together, regardless of the word that follows ""zup"" or the word that it follows, the output color for ""zup"" is always ""yellow"". No other words in the examples provided consistently correspond with the color yellow in the output. Hence, we can conclude the rule for ""zup"" based on the given examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,86,zup
"Given the examples, let's look for patterns that will help us deduce the meaning of ""zup.""

1. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> red yellow yellow red green
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> yellow yellow red red red
3. ""zup lug wif"" -> yellow blue red
4. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> green blue blue blue yellow red

From examples 1 and 2, we notice that ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" following ""zup,"" but in example 1, ""bluf"" without ""zup"" preceding it results in ""red."" This indicates that ""zup"" changes the output of the word following it.

Looking at example 3, ""lug"" normally results in ""blue,"" but when followed by ""zup,"" the output for ""lug"" remains unchanged.

From example 4, ""walm"" following a ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" where it would normally result in ""blue.""

In example 5, we see that when ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" the output for ""wif"" turns into ""yellow,"" whereas it would normally be ""red.""

Based on these examples, we can infer that ""zup"" changes the color output of the word immediately following it to ""yellow,"" regardless of the original color mapping of the subsequent word. This effect does not continue to the words that follow afterward.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

Rule: When ""zup"" precedes a word, it changes the output of the immediately following word to ""yellow.""",1.0,86,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Here is the rule deduced from the given examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,86,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can notice that ""zup"" is consistently being translated to the color ""yellow."" Hence, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" in the given context.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,86,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the inputs and outputs with respect to where ""zup"" appears.

1. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> ""red yellow yellow red green""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""zup lug wif"" -> ""yellow blue red""
4. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
5. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""

Looking at the outputs, every time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output position, regardless of its location in the string or the surrounding words.

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore:
zup -> yellow.",1.0,86,zup
"Rule:
Bluf -> ""Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before bluf in the sequence"". 

For instance, in ""dax bluf wif"", dax is associated with the color green, and so bluf takes the color green from ""dax."" In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" wif is associated with red, so bluf takes the color red. This rule holds for the examples provided.",1.0,86,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" directly translates to ""red"" in the output, since every instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red."" However, it is important to observe the patterns between the other words and their associated colors to ensure that ""bluf"" does not change its meaning based on context. 

In each case where ""bluf"" is present, it follows the pattern:

dax -> green
wif -> red
zup -> yellow
lug -> blue (from last example)

In all instances, no matter the position of ""bluf"" within the input, the output for ""bluf"" is consistently ""red"". The placement of ""bluf"" does not change the colors associated with other words either.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

bluf -> red. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or context within the given input examples.",1.0,86,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the following observations can be made:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the word that follows ""bluf"" gets the same color as the word before ""bluf"" in the output.

Here's how it works out with each example:

- 1st example: ""dax bluf wif"" results in ""green green red"". ""Dax"" is green, and ""wif"" right after ""bluf"" is also green.
- 2nd example: ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green"". ""Wif"" is red, and ""dax"" right after ""bluf"" is also red.
- 3rd example: ""zup wif bluf zup"" results in ""yellow red red yellow"". ""Wif"" is red before ""bluf"", and ""zup"" right after ""bluf"" is also red.
- 4th example: ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". ""Wif"" is red, and there is no word after ""bluf"", but if we infer from the pattern, ""bluf"" itself would be red too, mirroring ""wif"".
- 5th example: ""zup bluf dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow green blue"". ""Zup"" is yellow, and ""dax"" right after ""bluf"" is yellow as well.

Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf causes the next word to take on the color of the previous word. 

In terms of meaning, it seems like ""bluf"" functions as a ""mirror"" or ""copier"" for the color attribute of adjacent words. So, if using ""->"" to represent ""yields"" or ""results in"" we can state:

bluf -> causes the following word to be the same color as the preceding word.",1.0,86,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

The word ""bluf"" consistently correlates to the output color ""red"" in each example.",1.0,86,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns of the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

Looking at the examples provided:

1. dax bluf wif -> green green red
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue

We can make some observations:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is used, the word immediately following ""bluf"" has the same color as ""bluf"" in the corresponding output.
- The color before and after ""bluf"" is the same suggests that ""bluf"" might be repeating the color of the previous word.

From these observations, we can infer the likely rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it in the sequence.",0.8,86,bluf
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word. 

From the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in the output sequence. Here's how:

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated.
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" is associated with green, and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated; similarly, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated.
- In the third example, ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The ""walm"" word here causes the preceding color, ""red,"" to be repeated before moving on to ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated without any new word following to indicate a change in color.

Thus, the rule induced is that ""walm"" requires the preceding color to be repeated in the sequence.",1.0,86,walm
"Rule: walm -> blue

"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the word ""blue"" in the output every time it is used. However, ""walm"" also seems to be causing the word that follows it to repeat its color output as many times as there are letters in that following word. 

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green."" The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to ""blue"" three times, the same number of letters in the word ""lug."" The word ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and is translated to ""green.""

- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" gives ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" gets repeated three times as ""green,"" then ""zup"" follows ""walm"" resulting in ""yellow"" thrice.

- The third and fifth examples, ""zup walm lug"" and ""zup walm,"" have ""zup"" before ""walm,"" and thus ""yellow"" is repeated three times in both sequences.

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" we see ""wif"" being translated as ""red"" and it comes three times following ""walm,"" while the word ""lug"" is translated to ""blue.""

"Analyzing the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with a sequence of the word ""blue"". Since the rest of the words (""lug"", ""dax"", ""zup"", ""wif"", ""bluf"") are consistently mapped to single colors, it seems that ""walm"" always results in the word ""blue"" being repeated three times. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green""; since ""lug"" and ""dax"" are followed by single colors, ""walm"" is responsible for the three ""blue"" outputs.
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" where the presence of ""walm"" again proceeds a triad of ""blue"" instances.
- The third example, ""zup walm lug,"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" with ""walm"" once again being followed by a ""blue"" sequence.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the output is ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" where ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" once more, this time within a longer sequence.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup walm,"" the output is just ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is unexpected as there is no following ""blue"" for ""walm."" This is the only outlier, which could suggest an error in the example or additional context needed.

Based on these observations:

Rule: The word ""walm"" when followed by another word results in the word ""blue"" being outputted three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, there seems to be an exception, or it could be an error in the given examples.

In this input, ""wif"" translates to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue. It's worth noting that ""walm"" changes to blue, which indicates that ""walm""'s color might be context-dependent or that there is an additional rule at play that affects its output.

5. Input: dax lug dax

"Based on the provided examples, it seems like ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" whenever it appears in the input. However, we must also take into account that the color output words are sometimes repeated. By examining the examples closely, we can establish a rule that determines the output:

1. In all instances, the occurrence of ""bluf"" results in the color ""blue"".
2. The output color is repeated a number of times equal to the number of syllables in the input nonce word associated with that color. For example:
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and has one syllable; thus, it is only outputted once as ""red"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and has one syllable; thus, it is also outputted once as ""blue"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and appears with either one or two syllables; when it has one syllable, it is outputted once, when it has two (like in ""zup bluf""), it is outputted twice.
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" has three syllables.

Thus, the rule for repetition is based on the syllable count of the input nonce word.

Rule: bluf -> blue (with the color ""blue"" being repeated once as ""bluf"" contains one syllable).",1.0,87,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's examine each example and look for patterns.

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" adds an additional ""blue.""

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on the analysis, every time the word ""bluf"" is present, the output color is ""red."" However, when it follows certain words, it simply repeats the color of the previous word instead of producing ""red."" For example, after ""zup,"" it produces ""yellow,"" and after ""wif"" and ""dax,"" it produces ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color output of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" appears immediately after ""wif"" or ""dax,"" it repeats the color associated with those words, which are red and green, respectively.

Here is the rule written out:

bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" means repeat the color of the word just before it. If ""bluf"" is after ""wif"" or ""dax,"" it repeats the colors red and green, respectively. If ""bluf"" is in any other position, it seems to only repeat the color of the preceding word.",0.9,87,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pattern within the provided examples.

1. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
2. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
3. lug bluf zup -> blue blue yellow
4. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
5. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Analyzing the examples where ""bluf"" appears, we can establish the following observations:

- When ""bluf"" is present, the output is always ""red"" or ""blue"".
- ""Bluf"" appears to translate to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"", and to ""blue"" when it follows any other word.

To confirm the rule, let's check each instance:

1. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", confirming ""bluf"" is ""red"" after ""wif"".
2. ""bluf lug"" translates to ""blue"" after ""zup"", confirming ""bluf"" is ""blue"" when not after ""wif"".
3. ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"", indicating ""bluf"" is ""blue"" after ""lug"".
4. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", again confirming ""bluf"" is ""red"" after ""wif"".
5. ""dax bluf"" and ""zup bluf"" translate to ""green red"" and ""yellow blue"", respectively, further confirming that ""bluf"" is ""blue"" after other words except for ""wif"".

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""red"" when it follows ""wif""; otherwise, it means ""blue"".

Result: bluf -> ""red"" after ""wif"", ""blue"" after any other word.",0.9,87,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

1. Input: wif bluf lug | Output: red red blue
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""
   - ""bluf"" -> ""blue""
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - Reaffirms that ""wif"" -> ""red""
   - ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" -> ""blue""
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""walm"" -> ""blue""

3. Input: lug bluf zup | Output: blue blue yellow
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" -> ""blue""
   - ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   
   The repetition of ""blue"" suggests ""bluf"" may equate to ""blue,"" but let's continue to confirm.

4. Input: dax lug wif bluf | Output: green blue red red
   - ""dax"" -> ""green""
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""
   - ""bluf"" -> ""red""

   Here, ""bluf"" seems to map to ""red,"" which contradicts previous deductions. It may mean that ""bluf"" is context-dependent.

5. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug | Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" -> ""green""
   - ""bluf"" -> ""green""
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""
   - ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" -> ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""

It appears that ""bluf"" changes color based on the word that precedes it. In examples 4 and 5, 'bluf' takes the color of the word that comes before it. 

Let's summarize the rules based on observations:

- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green""

For ""bluf,"" it initially appeared to map to ""blue,"" but later examples show that it changes based on the preceding word. To be more specific:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word preceding it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" maps to the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before it to provide context, it defaults to ""blue"" based on the initial examples.",0.8,87,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word. The color repeats three times if ""walm"" is the last word, or it repeats as many times as there are words following ""walm."" Here's how the rule applies to each example:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule: Repeat ""green"" three times, since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
Rule: Repeat ""blue"" three times followed by the color corresponding to ""wif.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Rule: Start with ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" follow with ""red"" for ""wif,"" then repeat ""red"" three times due to ""walm.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: Repeat ""yellow"" three times, since ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Rule: Start with ""green"" for ""dax,"" then ""blue"" for ""lug,"" and repeat ""blue"" three times because of ""walm.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a word that corresponds to a color, repeat the color of the preceding word three times if ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence. If ""walm"" is followed by other words, repeat the color for as many times as there are words after ""walm"" before continuing with the colors corresponding to the following words.

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times if it is the last word in the sequence, or as many times as there are following words if there are any.",1.0,87,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word thrice. 

For example:
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
- ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated thrice because of ""walm,"" followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" makes it repeat thrice.
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat three times. 

Therefore, walm -> causes the last color to be repeated three times.",1.0,87,walm
"From the provided examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" changes the output color to triple repetition of the color tied to the word before ""walm"". The rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and produces that color three times in the output. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax walm"" -> green green green (dax leads to green, followed by walm -> three greens)
2. ""lug walm wif"" -> blue blue blue red (lug leads to blue, followed by walm -> three blues, wif is red)
3. ""zup wif walm"" -> yellow red red red (zup leads to yellow, wif leads to red, followed by walm -> three reds)
4. ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow (zup leads to yellow, followed by walm -> three yellows)
5. ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue (dax leads to green, lug leads to blue, followed by walm -> three blues)

So, the rule we can establish is: 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to be the color represented by that word repeated three times.

Expressing the rule directly for ""walm"":
walm -> repeats the preceding color descriptor three times.",1.0,87,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the outputs of each example while paying attention to the presence of ""walm"" and the other words that accompany it.

- When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red.""

In all cases, the presence of ""walm"" results in repeated colors. Specifically:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""; all greens.
- ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red""; all blues until ""wif"" which is red.
- ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red""; the ""red"" follows ""wif,"" but the subsequent ""red"" and the absence of ""yellow"" after ""walm"" indicates that ""walm"" carries the repetition effect of ""red.""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""; all yellows, since ""zup"" is yellow.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""; the ""green"" follows ""dax,"" ""blue"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated due to ""walm.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be:

""Walm"" -> meaning: The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the last color mentioned before it, for the total number of words in the input (including ""walm"").

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a color word, the output is three repetitions of that color's corresponding output. If there are two color words before ""walm,"" the output will be three repetitions of the last color's corresponding output. If ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""wif"" (red), it overrides the previous color and repeats ""red"" accordingly.",0.8,87,walm
"Given the examples, it appears that the term ""walm"" doesn't produce a single consistent output color. Instead, the color that ""walm"" outputs seems dependent on the word preceding it. Let's analyze each example:

1. **dax walm**
   - Output: green green green
   - Rule: The output is three repetitions of the color associated with ""dax.""

2. **lug walm wif**
   - Output: blue blue blue red
   - Rule: The output is three repetitions of the color associated with ""lug,"" followed by the color associated with ""wif.""

3. **zup wif walm**
   - Output: yellow red red red
   - The first part ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red,"" followed by the output for ""walm,"" which is an additional two reds, suggesting that ""walm"" here is based on ""wif.""

4. **zup walm**
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Rule: The output is three repetitions of the color associated with ""zup.""

5. **dax lug walm**
   - Output: green blue blue blue
   - Rule: ""dax"" is associated with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""walm"" in this context seems to take on the color associated with ""lug,"" repeated thrice.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the color associated with the immediately preceding word and repeats it three times. If we assume ""wif"" is associated with red based on example 2, then in example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" repeating red thrice (though ""zup wif"" already includes one red, only two additional reds are shown).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",0.8,87,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,88,lug
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. There is a direct and consistent mapping between the nonce word ""lug"" and the color ""blue,"" regardless of the context or position of the word ""lug"" in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,88,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.",1.0,88,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,88,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each given example.",1.0,88,lug
"To deduce the meaning or rules associated with the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the given examples.

In each output sequence, ""green"" represents a correct position and element; ""yellow"" signifies the correct element but in the wrong position; and ""red"" indicates a wrong element.

Now, let's see how these colors map to the word ""dax"" in the examples:

1. In the first input, ""dax walm zup"" maps to ""green green green yellow."" We notice that ""dax"" maps to ""green"", which suggests it is correct in position and element.

2. In the second input, ""dax zup walm wif"" maps to ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" Here again ""dax"" receives a ""green"", meaning correct position and element. 

3. The third input, ""dax zup wif,"" results in ""green yellow red,"" which again shows ""dax"" as ""green"" for the correct element and position.
   
4. The fourth input, ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" gives us ""green green red yellow red."" Still, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, the position of ""dax"" has changed, it is now the third element in the sequence ""wif walm dax zup."" This input gives us ""red red red green yellow,"" indicating that ""dax"" is no longer in the correct position but still the correct element.

If we assess the pattern, ""dax"" is consistently mapped to ""green"" when it is the first element, indicating that ""dax"" is correctly placed at the beginning of the sequence. However, when ""dax"" is in any other position (as seen in example 5), it maps to ""yellow"" (correct element but wrong position) or ""red"" (entirely incorrect) depending on its positioning and the other words in the sequence.

Based on the inputs and outputs, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be that it must be placed at the beginning of the sequence to be considered correctly positioned. When ""dax"" is in the correct position (at the start), everything that follows is evaluated for being in the correct or incorrect position (green or yellow), and if an element is not included in the correct sequence at all, it is marked as red.

Rule: dax -> must be at the beginning of the sequence to be correct (green). If it is placed elsewhere, it does not conform to the rule and does not receive a green.",1.0,88,dax
"dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a position within a sequence. Rule:

Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern that associates the word ""dax"" with a specific position within the input sequence, which corresponds to a color in the output sequence.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
In this case, ""dax"" appears as the first word and corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Here, ""dax"" is again the first word, and once again, it corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red
""dax"" is the first word, which corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red
""dax"" is the first word, and it corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
""dax"" is the third word and corresponds to the third color ""green"" in the output.

Based on this pattern, we can induce that ""dax"" represents the first occurrence of the color ""green"" in the sequence. If ""dax"" appears first in the input, it corresponds to the first 'green'. If it appears in another position, it identifies the first 'green' that would appear in the output sequence, at the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> The word ""dax"" corresponds to the first occurrence of the color ""green"" in the output sequence, taking a position in the output that matches its position in the input sequence.",1.0,88,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at the patterns where it shows up and the corresponding output colors.

- Whenever ""dax"" appears as the first word, the first output color is green.
- When ""dax"" appears later in the sequence, its corresponding output color is red (as shown in the last example).
- The position of ""dax"" relative to other words does not seem to affect the output color of those other words.

Given this information:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output color green when it is the first word in the input sequence, and red when it appears elsewhere in the sequence.",1.0,88,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs in each example, searching for patterns. Let's examine the outputs (colors) corresponding to the appearance of ""dax"" and other context-dependent variables in the input:

1. ""dax walm zup"" outputs ""green green green yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green.""

2. ""dax zup walm wif"" outputs ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" again.
   
3. ""dax zup wif"" outputs ""green yellow red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more.

4. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" outputs ""green green red yellow red""
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green"" again.

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow""
   - Here, ""dax"" is not in the first position but still corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, we see that irrespective of its position in the input, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. The position or surrounding words do not seem to affect this association.

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,88,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can analyze the patterns associated with its usage and the respective outputs. 

- In all instances where the word ""dax"" appears, the output begins with ""green."" 
- The position of ""dax"" in the input sequence does not seem to alter the first ""green"" in the output, as seen when ""dax"" appears at the beginning or in the middle of the sequence. 
- Looking at the other words and their correlated output colors, we do not see a consistent pattern like we do for ""dax,"" indicating that ""dax"" is a special trigger for the first ""green.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: When ""dax"" is present in the input, it causes the output to start with ""green.""

Therefore:

dax -> meaning: The presence of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,88,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following relationships between the input words and the output colors:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""lug"" also consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red.""

In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red."" Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""wif"" is consistent across all examples.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,88,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each instance where ""wif"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" is produced in the output. Here are the indications from each example:

- In the first example, ""wif walm lug"" produces ""red red blue,"" where ""wif"" is directly followed by ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" produces ""red yellow yellow red green,"" with both instances of ""wif"" resulting in ""red.""
- In the third example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red,"" with ""wif"" being the second word and ""red"" being the second color in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow red green red red,"" and both occurrences of ""wif"" are once again matched with ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug walm"" maps to ""red blue blue blue,"" where ""wif"" stands for ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,88,wif
"From the examples given, we can try to deduce which colors correspond to which words. Each word seems to map to a color, and we need to determine what color ""wif"" corresponds to.

Example 2:
- wif -> red

Example 4:
- zup -> yellow

Example 5:
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue (This seems to contradict Example 1, where lug was assigned to red, but given the consistent mapping of wif to red, it may be that the Output of Example 1 may contain an error.)
- walm -> blue

Based on these examples, ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,88,wif

3. dax wif -> green red
4. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
5. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue

Now, let's look at each usage of ""wif"" and the corresponding output color.

From all examples, it can be noticed that whenever ""wif"" is used, the output is ""red."" It does not seem to depend on its position, nor the words that come before or after it.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and to ""blue"" otherwise. Here's the breakdown of examples given and the contexts in which ""bluf"" appears:

1. wif bluf -> red
2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue
3. dax zup bluf -> yellow
4. zup bluf -> yellow
5. wif bluf zup -> red

Since there is only one instance that could lead to a rule where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red,"" and in all other instances ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" I propose the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it immediately follows ""wif."" In all other contexts, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue."" 

Hence, the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to be associated with a specific color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

1. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green.
2. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output color is red.
3. The term ""walm"" is not directly associated with a specific color output on its own.

Given that the color outputs change in accordance with the word preceding ""walm,"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" seems to function as a repeater or duplicator of the output color associated with the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Hence,

walm -> functions as a color repeater/duplicator depending on the preceding word.",1.0,88,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in which it occurs, and the output produced when it does.

1. When ""dax"" occurs, it is followed by ""green.""
2. When ""wif"" occurs, it is followed by ""red.""
3. When ""zup"" occurs, it is followed by ""yellow.""
4. ""lug"" is less regular, but seems to be translated to ""blue"" in the presence of ""dax."" 

Looking at the outputs corresponding to ""walm,"" we can see:

- In all instances where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by the same color as the preceding word (i.e., if the preceding word translates to ""green,"" ""walm"" also translates to ""green"").
- In the third example, ""walm"" occurs consecutively without a separate input word in between, and it results in repeated ""yellow"" each time, further supporting the idea that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it.

Therefore, the underlying rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes on the color/output of the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> takes the same output as the preceding word.",1.0,88,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at how it affects the pattern of colors in the output. In every instance, the word that precedes ""walm"" in the input is immediately followed by the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of the word itself (whether it is ""dax"" or ""wif""), suggesting that ""walm"" maintains the color of the word preceding it. Let's check this pattern across all examples:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and ""walm"" is also followed by ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""walm"" retains the color ""red"" after it.
- In the fourth example, both ""dax"" and ""wif"" are followed by their respective colors, ""green"" and ""red,"" but ""walm"" after ""dax"" continues with ""green.""
- In the fifth example, the pattern remains consistent with ""dax"" leading to ""green"" and ""walm"" maintaining it, with ""wif"" and subsequent word ""zup"" having their own colors of ""red"" and ""yellow.""

From these observations, the rule can be formulated as follows:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word before ""walm.""

Thus, the meaning attributed to ""walm"" based on the examples provided is:

walm -> meaning: Repeats the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,88,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" is a nonce word that influences the color output preceding it. When ""walm"" is used, it seems to cause the preceding word to output its corresponding color multiple times in a row. It's notable that the colors red, green, and yellow have been associated with the words ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" respectively. ""Lug"" is associated with ""blue"" but only appears once even if preceded by ""walm.""

To construct the rule for walm, we notice the following patterns:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", so ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in the color green repeating three times.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", so ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in the color red repeating three times.
- ""zup walm"" hasn't been provided directly in the examples, but ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in the color yellow repeating three times.
- ""lug"" only appears following ""walm"" once, and its corresponding color blue appears once as well. It's unclear if ""walm"" would cause ""lug"" to repeat multiple times because it's not indicated by the provided examples.

Based on this information, the tentative rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup,"" it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. It is not confirmed what happens when ""walm"" follows ""lug"" or any other words not provided in the examples.

To express it as requested: walm -> causes the preceding word's color to repeat three times.",0.8,88,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze each input in relation to its output. Here are the observations:

- In every instance where ""walm"" is present, the color sequence includes a ""green"" immediately before and after the instance of ""walm"" with an additional color for each instance of ""walm.""
  
  - When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" the series of ""green"" colours increment with one additional ""green"" for ""walm.""
  - When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" the output changes similarly, but it increments in ""red"" instead.

Now let's look at the examples:

1. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue green."" Here, the ""walm"" leads to an extra ""green"" between ""dax"" sequences.

2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" leads to a pattern where ""walm"" consistently increases the number of ""red"" colors after ""wif"".

3. ""wif walm zup walm"" showcases that a single ""walm"" after ""wif"" adds one ""red"" and a subsequent ""walm"" adds two yellows.

4. ""dax walm wif"" and ""dax walm wif zup"" show that ""walm"" after ""dax"" adds an additional ""green"" before the sequence changes to the color denoted by the following word.

Given these observations, ""walm"" seems to function as a repeater or duplicator for the color of the word that precedes it, with the specific behavior of incrementing the count of the repeated color by one. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: When ""walm"" follows a color word (like ""dax"" for green or ""wif"" for red), it causes the output to contain an extra instance of the color directly before ""walm"" is mentioned. If ""walm"" is subsequently followed by the same color word, it is also repeated once more in the output. If ""walm"" is not followed by a color word, it results in two ""yellow"" colors in the output.",0.8,88,walm
"Rule: lug -> blue

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,89,lug
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sentence or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule can be described as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,89,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. This suggests that ""dax"" consistently represents the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is as follows:
dax -> green",1.0,89,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" translates to a consistent output across all the examples. The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of its position or the surrounding words. 

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,89,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds with ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position within the input sequence. The other words such as ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" respectively. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" can be determined as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,89,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" is the following:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,89,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Thus, the rule is:
wif -> red.",1.0,89,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the input and output pairs to determine any patterns.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
* Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when followed by another word.

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
* ""wif"" appears twice in the sequence and corresponds to ""red"" both times. It is followed by ""dax"" and ""zup,"" which output ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
* Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" at the end of the sequence.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
* ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue.""

Input: wif
Output: red
* ""wif"" by itself corresponds to ""red.""

From these examples, it is clear that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,89,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and the output in the provided examples:

1. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup | Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
3. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
4. Input: dax zup lug wif lug | Output: green yellow blue red blue
5. Input: wif | Output: red

From these examples, we can observe that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Furthermore, the examples demonstrate that ""wif"" can be used as a standalone term or within a sequence of other terms.

Therefore, based on the provided data, we can deduce that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the outputs.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,89,wif

"Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,89,wif
"Based on the given examples, the appearance of the word ""zup"" in an input sequence corresponds to the output of the color ""yellow"". In every instance, regardless of where ""zup"" is placed in the sequence or what other words are involved, ""yellow"" is consistently produced in the output sequence. 

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,89,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's consider the output patterns in correlation with the input strings. Below is the analysis of each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to three ""red.""
   - After ""zup,"" ""walm"" changes from three ""red"" to three ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - After ""zup,"" there is a ""yellow"" with no preceding word to compare it with.

3. Input: lug dax zup wif
   Output: blue green yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - After ""zup,"" ""wif"" which was not present before ""zup,"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but here it's after ""zup"" and is preceded by ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - After ""zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to three ""red.""

From these patterns, we can induce that ""zup"" acts as a modifier that changes the color code of the immediately following word to ""yellow,"" independent of what the color code for that word was before ""zup"" was used.

Rule: zup -> changes the color code of the next word to ""yellow""",0.9,89,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""zup"" is a command which affects the output based on the following context:

1. Whenever ""zup"" is followed by a word, the color associated with that word is output three times. For example, ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""walm"" which follows ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" repeated three times.

2. When ""zup"" stands alone before a word without repetition, it results in ""yellow"" followed by the color associated with the next word. For example, ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow"".

3. ""zup"" at the beginning or amidst other words results in ""yellow"" preceding the sequence of colors associated with the following words. For example, ""zup wif lug dax"" results in ""yellow red blue green"".

Based on these observations, we can conclude the rule:

Rule: ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" as a prefix to the color sequence that follows. If the next word is repeated, the color corresponding to that word is output three times. If ""zup"" is followed by unique words, it outputs ""yellow"" once followed by the sequence of colors corresponding to each word. 

So, the rule for zup is:
zup -> outputs ""yellow"" followed by manipulating the output sequence of the upcoming word(s). If the immediately following word is repeated, the associated color is repeated three times. If there are unique words, each word's associated color is output once after ""yellow"".",0.8,89,zup
"Analyzing the examples provided, we notice a pattern in the output associated with the presence of the word ""zup.""

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" we see an extra ""red"" and ""yellow"" outputs compared to when ""walm"" is at the beginning, suggesting ""zup"" may cause the word following it to double its output.

2. The word ""dax"" after ""zup"" and alone generates a single ""green"" followed by ""yellow""; however, when ""lug"" and ""wif"" precede ""dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is a single ""green.""

3. When ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and ""lug,"" the output remains consistent with their singular representations when ""zup"" is not present.

Based on the observations, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" causes the color representation for the word immediately following it to be followed by a ""yellow.""

So, zup -> causes the next word's output to be followed by ""yellow"".",0.8,89,zup
"Analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the rule for the word ""zup"" by looking at the position it occupies in the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

Here are the observations:

1. When ""zup"" follows another word, it seems to repeat the color of the word before it but in a yellow color. For example:
   - ""wif walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" is followed by another occurrence of ""walm,"" and the output for ""walm"" after ""zup"" is yellow, repeated three times.
   - ""dax zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow"". Here ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" and the output color is yellow, not green, indicating a change influenced by ""zup.""

2. When ""zup"" precedes other words, it generates a single yellow output before the output colors of the succeeding words. For instance:
   - ""zup wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue green"". Here ""zup"" comes before ""wif,"" and it produces a single yellow color.
   
The rule derived from these examples is:

Rule: ""zup"" modifies the output in the following way:
- When ""zup"" is positioned after another word, it produces an output of yellow color following the color of the preceding word.
- When ""zup"" precedes a word, it creates a single yellow output before the outputs for the following words.

Here is a formulation for the rule:

zup -> If ""zup"" precedes a word, insert a yellow before the color of the next word. If it follows a word, repeat the color of the previous word once in yellow.",0.8,89,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a doubling of the color associated with the previous word. Each unique word (wif, lug, zup, dax) translates to a specific color (red, blue, yellow, green), and when the word ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated twice.

Here is the rule:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"" twice.

Rule: bluf -> Double the previous color.",1.0,89,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the previously mentioned color word. 

Breaking it down:
- In each case, immediately preceding ""bluf"", there is a color word (e.g., wif, lug, zup, dax).
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green.
- The output after ""bluf"" is the color associated with the previous color word used before ""bluf"", and it is repeated once.

So, in each instance, ""bluf"" simply means to repeat the color indicated by the word right before ""bluf"", which results in the outputted color being said twice in a row.",1.0,89,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to result in the duplication of the immediately preceding color word in the output. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and following ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" caused ""red"" to be repeated.
- In the second example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" and following ""bluf,"" the output included ""yellow yellow."" This again shows that ""bluf"" caused the color word preceding it (""yellow"") to be duplicated.
- In the third example, the words ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and another ""dax"" translate to ""green,"" ""blue,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively. Following ""bluf"" in this sequence, ""red red"" appears, pointing out that ""red"" was duplicated because of ""bluf.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and in both cases, ""yellow yellow"" is the output, indicating a duplication caused by ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> causes the duplication of the color word that appears directly before it.",1.0,89,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" is the color word that is associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another nonce word, its corresponding output is a repetition of the color that was the output of the word before it.",1.0,89,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to a duplication of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For instance:

1. ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" meaning ""bluf"" duplicates the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
2. ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow.
3. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green,"" with ""bluf"" duplicating the red from ""wif.""
4. ""dax zup bluf"" equals ""green yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" duplicating the yellow from ""zup.""
5. ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" duplicating the yellow of ""zup"" again.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: bluf -> meaning. Bluf duplicates the color of the word that comes directly before it.",1.0,89,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the examples, we need to identify a pattern in the input that could correspond to the output, keeping in mind the placement and context of ""walm"".

In the first example:
Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

In the second example:
Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

In the third example:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

In the fourth example:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

In the fifth example:
Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Looking closely:
- Whenever ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" the output before ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""dax"" comes after ""walm,"" the output after ""walm"" is ""green.""
- The position of ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- The output color sequence following ""walm"" matches the color that represents the word immediately following ""walm.""
- The color that precedes ""walm"" in the output depends on the word that precedes ""walm"" in the input.

Hence, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that precedes it thrice, followed by the color that corresponds to the word that comes after it (if there is a word after ""walm"").

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" in the context of these examples means to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times and then follow it with the color associated with the immediately succeeding word, if there is one.",1.0,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the relation between the input and the output across all examples:

1. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
2. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
3. wif walm dax -> red red red green
4. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
5. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue

Let's analyze the position and output of ""walm"" in the sequence:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""lug,"" the output color for ""walm"" matches ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue).
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again matches the output color blue.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows both ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and the color of ""walm"" matches the preceding word ""lug"" (blue).

Based on these observations, the pattern seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately prior to it.

walm -> meaning. Rule: The color corresponding to ""walm"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,89,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples and see if there's a pattern that matches the word with its corresponding output. 

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue."" The second ""green"" must correspond to ""walm,"" since ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green."" 

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

In this example, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red."" As in the first example, ""walm"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" the same color as the word directly preceding it.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" the same color as ""wif,"" which precedes it.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the same color as ""lug,"" the word before it.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""Walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the same color as ""lug,"" which precedes it.

Based on the provided examples, the rule for ""walm"" is that it takes on the color of the word immediately before it. 

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each pair of input and output lines to see what is consistent when ""walm"" is used:

Input: dax walm zup lug | Output: green green green yellow blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" is followed by the color ""green"" as well, suggesting a rule might be involved related to ""dax"" or the placement of ""walm"".

Input: lug walm wif bluf | Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" here is followed by the color ""blue"", indicating a rule might be related to ""lug"" or its position again.

Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" here, aligning with the color of ""wif"".

Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" produces ""blue"" here, matching ""lug""'s color.

Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" results in ""blue"" at the end, maintaining consistency with ""lug"".

From the above, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely means ""repeat the color of the previous word."" This rule seems to be consistent in all cases where ""walm"" appears, as each time ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to identify a pattern that relates ""walm"" to the corresponding output colors. Let's examine each input and its output and look for correlations.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug | Output: green green green yellow blue
2. Input: lug walm wif bluf | Output: blue blue blue red red
3. Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green
4. Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green
5. Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue

Notice that:

- In the first and second examples, the color before ""walm"" is green and blue, respectively, and the following two colors after ""walm"" are the same as the color before it.
- In the third and fourth examples, there are only two words, and ""walm"" is followed by a single word. The color following ""walm"" is the same as the color associated with that following word when it stands alone.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is at the end, and the color before ""walm"" is blue. The resulting color for ""wif lug walm"" is red, blue, blue, blue, showing that ""wif lug"" generates red blue, and ""walm"" appears to repeat the last mentioned color, which is blue. 

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated for a number of times that is context-dependent (either it repeats twice or it repeats until the end of the sequence in cases where ""walm"" is at the end).

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",0.8,89,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue."" There is no variation in output for ""lug"" across different inputs, so we can infer a straightforward meaning.

"Based on the provided examples, dax corresponds to the word green.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,90,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Other words like ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" have a one-to-one correspondence with ""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" across all examples.",1.0,90,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,90,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by analyzing the input and corresponding output patterns.

1. Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
2. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
3. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax -> Output: yellow green green yellow green
4. Input: dax zup lug bluf -> Output: green yellow blue blue
5. Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red

Looking at the patterns, we can see that:

- When the input is ""zup dax,"" the output is ""yellow green.""
- Adding another word to the sequence, like ""bluf"" or ""wif,"" results in another color being added to the output sequence in the same order as the input.
- When ""dax"" appears after ""zup,"" the color green always follows yellow immediately.
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green when used in sequence after ""zup dax,"" but it corresponds to the color blue when used after ""dax"" alone.
- Ordering affects the resulting colors, as seen in example 4.

From this analysis, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Based on this rule, the meaning can be defined as:

dax -> green",0.9,90,dax
"Analyzing the examples given, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. The output does not seem context-dependent in relation to the position of ""wif""; it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Even when ""wif"" appears alone in the input, the output is ""red.""

Therefore, the rule induced from the given examples is:

wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,90,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Each example that includes ""wif"" therefore yields ""red"" as part of the output, with no variation on its position or context impacting this outcome. Here is the deduction based on each input including ""wif"":

- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
  The presence of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" as the first output.

- Input: wif -> Output: red
  ""wif"" on its own still produces ""red.""

- Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
  Regardless of it being the first or second word, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

- Input: wif -> Output: red
  Again, ""wif"" produces ""red"" as the sole output.

- Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
  ""Wif"" is the fourth word and is paired with ""red"" in the output sequence, consistent with all other examples.

The rule I've induced is as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" in any position within an input string corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output string.",1.0,90,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. This pattern holds true across single and multiple word inputs.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,90,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the appearance of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. Every time ""wif"" is presented in the input, ""red"" is included in the output. Therefore, we can induce that the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,90,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,90,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Moreover, there doesn't appear to be a contextual dependency; ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position among other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,90,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color output. Here are how the examples map to colors:

1. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
2. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. lug zup -> blue yellow
4. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we notice that:

- Each occurrence of ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"". 
- This mapping does not seem to depend on the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or on the words that come before or after it.
- Also, ""zup"" does not seem to be affected by the word following it, as it leads to a ""yellow"" output even when standing alone or followed by different words (e.g., ""walm"" or ""lug"").

Therefore, we can conclude with high confidence that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the surrounding context.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,90,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that zup translates to yellow consistently.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,90,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,90,zup
"From the examples given, we can observe a pattern that aligns each word with a specific color. All the instances of ""zup"" correspond to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, according to the examples provided:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" directly translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,90,zup
Rule: bluf corresponds to the color red.,1.0,90,bluf
"Analyzing the provided input and output pairs, we can see that each input word is directly translated to a color in the output. To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for a pattern in the output that corresponds to the appearance of ""bluf"" in the input.

From the provided examples:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""green"" always follows in the output, except after ""wif,"" which is followed by ""red"" in the output.
   
2. When ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input, the output is ""green.""
   
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it results in ""red"" in the output.
   
4. ""Bluf"" never appears at the beginning of the input, so we do not have an example of what might come before it.

Given these occurrences, it's safe to deduce that the basic rule for ""bluf"" is that it translates to ""green"" in the output unless it directly follows the word ""wif,"" in which case it translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

bluf -> ""green"" (in general), but ""red"" if preceded by ""wif"".

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows any word other than ""wif,"" then the output is ""green."" If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""",1.0,90,bluf
"bluf -> red. Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" This can be consistently seen across all examples provided. Whenever ""bluf"" is given in the input, the output is ""red"".",1.0,90,bluf
"Considering the examples, each occurrence of the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the output word ""green.""

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"" in the sequence, while other words map to different colors.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""blue"" in the sequence. This seems off, as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in other examples. Since we have established ""bluf"" as ""green"" in previous examples, this could be a mistake in the output.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green.""

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""red,"" which contradicts our established rule. Since this is the only example contradicting the rule, it might be an error in the output or ""bluf"" may sometimes take the color before it, which is ""red"" in this case.

Based on the majority of evidence, we can assert:

Rule: bluf -> green

However, there are two conflicting examples that might suggest errors in the provided outputs or a more complex rule that we cannot determine with the available information.",0.6,90,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided, we see that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""bluf,"" in every instance, corresponds to the color ""green."" Thus, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" as it is used in these examples. 

Rule: bluf -> green.",0.0,90,bluf
"From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the Input three times in the Output. Given that the outputs are just repetitions of colors, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to represent the instruction to repeat the color that comes before it three times.

Here is how ""walm"" functions in each example provided:

- In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and then ""walm"" follows, which results in ""green green green."" 
- In ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, then ""walm"" follows, resulting in ""blue blue blue""; similarly, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, then ""walm"" follows, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, and then ""walm"" follows, which gives ""red red red.""
- Similarly, in ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,90,walm
"walm -> repetition of the previous color mentioned. Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates that the color represented by the word immediately preceding it should be repeated three times.",1.0,90,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to signify a repetition of the color indicated by the word that comes before it. Each nonce word—zup, wif, dax, and lug—corresponds to a specific color. When followed by ""walm,"" the output repeats the color associated with that word three times. Here's the breakdown:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the corresponding color word is repeated three times:

- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- wif walm -> red red red
- dax walm -> green green green
- lug walm -> blue blue blue

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous nonce word three times.",1.0,90,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the term ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

- lug -> blue

And when ""walm"" follows each of these words, the output is a repetition of that color three times. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, three times.",1.0,90,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it indicates to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,90,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,91,lug
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""lug"" translates to a specific color in the output each time it appears. In every example, the word ""lug"" is consistently associated with the output color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" based on the given examples is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,91,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,91,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we must find a pattern in the examples given. Let's examine the instances where ""lug"" occurs and its corresponding output:

1. ""lug dax"" -> Output: ""blue green""
2. ""dax zup lug wif zup"" -> Output: ""green yellow blue red yellow""
3. ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> Output: ""red red green blue""
4. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> Output: ""green blue yellow red red green""

Now let's analyze how ""lug"" may affect the output:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""dax"" and the colors are ""blue green.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""wif""; the colors before and after ""lug"" are ""yellow"" and ""red,"" which are different from the first example.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is at the end after ""dax,"" and the colors are ""green blue."" This is similar to example 1, where ""lug"" also followed ""dax,"" resulting in ""blue"" being the color immediately following ""lug.""
- The fourth example is a repetition of elements seen before. ""Dax"" precedes and follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color ""green"" before and ""blue"" after ""lug.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

- ""lug"" always corresponds to the output color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Hence, the rule we can deduce for the nonce word ""lug"" is:

Rule: lug -> corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,91,lug

"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,91,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position within the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,91,dax

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is used in input, it is translated to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position or surrounding words.",1.0,91,dax
"Based on the given input-output pairs, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be consistent across all examples. The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" each time it is used, regardless of its position in the sequence. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

"dax -> green

Rule: Each time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.",1.0,91,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each instance of ""wif"" correlates directly to the output of ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,91,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There doesn't seem to be any dependence on context or position in the input string, as ""wif"" always results in the same output regardless of where it appears or what other words are around it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,91,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the position or the words surrounding it. 

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Example 5:
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Observing the examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, a ""yellow"" appears in the output in the corresponding position. This indicates that ""zup"" likely translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be defined as: zup -> yellow.",1.0,91,zup
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's observe where ""zup"" appears in each input and what color appears in the corresponding position in the output.

- In the first input ""dax walm zup,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second input ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" ""zup"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow"" both times.
- In the third input ""lug zup wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth input ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth input ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,91,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we need to analyze the inputs and outputs to establish the relationship between the word ""zup"" and the specific color outputs. Looking at the given examples:

- wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- lug zup wif -> blue yellow red
- wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
- lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green

We can notice that ""zup"" appears in different positions within the input and is associated with different colors depending on the context. Thus, ""zup"" does not translate directly to a single color.

However, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output:

- In example 1, ""zup"" is the fourth word and is assigned ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""zup"" appears twice, in the second and sixth positions, and both times it corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""zup"" is the second word and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""zup"" is the third word and again corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""zup"" is the second word and corresponds to ""yellow.""

Furthermore, ""yellow"" does not appear in the output unless ""zup"" is present in the input. It’s also worth noting that other words like ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""blue"" regardless of the presence of ""zup.""

   - ""bluf"" appears twice and each time it is followed by the color that was mentioned just before it (""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively).

2. Input: zup bluf

3. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""blue"" two more times, then ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug"" again as ""blue"" and ""walm,"" which repeats ""blue"" two more times.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""red"" two more times.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""green"" two more times, then another ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" as ""red."" 

Hence, ""walm"" is a function that repeats the color word that comes immediately before it in the output.",1.0,91,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the word ""walm"" is always associated with a repeated color in the output. For each occurrence of ""walm,"" the corresponding color is repeated three times (except in the third example where ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" and is followed again by ""lug walm"" without repeating ""lug"" in between, still resulting in a threefold repetition of ""blue""). 

Given the consistent replication of color words upon the appearance of ""walm,"" but no apparent link to a specific color (as ""walm"" corresponds to different colors in different contexts), we can induce that ""walm"" signifies the repetition of the last mentioned color thrice.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color three times.",0.9,91,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can look for patterns to deduce what ""walm"" means in each context.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
3. When ""walm"" follows a repeating pattern (example 3), the output for ""walm"" matches the color of the word it follows, except when the pattern changes (introduction of ""zup""), it's followed by yellow before resuming the pattern.
4. When ""walm"" is the final word after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red."" However, when ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and is not the final word, it yields ""red.""
5. When ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup,"" the output is ""green green green.""

From these examples, we cannot deduce a single meaning of ""walm,"" but we can establish a rule where ""walm"" seems to mimic the output color of the word that precedes it with some occurrences of ""walm"" being followed by ""yellow"" as a possible indicator of the end or change in pattern.

Rule: ""walm"" seems to replicate the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence, sometimes followed by a ""yellow"" when the pattern changes or ends.",0.8,91,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""lug"" appears to be consistent across all examples. Wherever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. This pattern holds true regardless of the other words present or their corresponding outputs. 

Thus, the rule is: lug -> blue",1.0,92,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the output ""blue."" This consistent one-to-one mapping suggests that ""lug"" simply means ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,92,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.",1.0,92,lug

Rule: lug means blue.",1.0,92,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word lug corresponds to the color blue. Each instance of lug in the input is translated to blue in the output.",1.0,92,lug
dax -> green. Rule: The word 'dax' translates to the color 'green'.,1.0,92,dax
"dax -> green. 

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,92,dax

"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears exactly once in the output. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input, it consistently maps to the color green in the output.",1.0,92,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,92,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every example provided. Its position in the sentence does not alter its translation.",1.0,92,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,92,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that accompany it. See the breakdown below:

- dax zup wif -> green yellow red (wif corresponds to red)
- wif -> red (wif standalone still corresponds to red)
- zup dax wif -> yellow green red (wif corresponds to red)
- wif -> red (wif standalone still corresponds to red)
- wif zup -> red yellow (wif corresponds to red)

Considering this, we can conclude the following rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,92,wif
"Based on the examples provided, here are the observations:

1. Whenever the word ""wif"" is included in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
2. The output does not depend on the order of the words in the input. ""dax zup wif"" and ""zup dax wif"" both produce the same sequence of colors, only in the order that the words ""dax"" and ""zup"" are mentioned.
3. The presence of the other words (""dax"" and ""zup"") brings additional colors (""green"" and ""yellow"", respectively), but ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red"".

From this analysis, we can deduce the rule:

wif -> red",1.0,92,wif
"zup -> yellow

From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" However, for the other words, we have ""wif"" associated with a single red and ""walm"" associated with repeating the color red for as many times as the letters in the word (walm = red red red red), and ""dax"" associated with green. Therefore:

Rule:
- ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" means ""red.""
- ""walm"" means ""red"" repeated for each letter in ""walm.""
- ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,92,zup
"From the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". The output remains ""yellow"" whenever the input begins with ""zup"", regardless of the other words accompanying it.

Therefore, based on the data provided:

zup -> yellow

Rule:
- When the input is solely ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by another word, ""zup"" contributes ""yellow"" as the first color in the output sequence, with other colors being added according to the words following ""zup.""
- The repetition or nature of the colors associated with the words following ""zup"" is not determined from the given examples. For example, ""wif"" leads to three ""red"" and ""walm"" leads to three ""yellow,"" but there is no clear rule derived for this given the limited data. Additional examples would be needed to determine the rules for other words.",1.0,92,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules:

1. The input ""zup"" consistently outputs the word ""yellow,"" regardless of what follows it. Therefore, ""zup"" directly corresponds to ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" is followed by another word, the output is ""yellow"" followed by a series of colors. The word following ""zup"" seems to determine which color and how many times it will be repeated.
3. ""wif"" leads to one instance of ""red.""
4. ""walm"" leads to three instances of ""yellow.""
5. ""dax"" leads to one instance of ""green.""

Thus, zup -> yellow. When ""zup"" is standalone, it maps to the color ""yellow."" The subsequent word seems to map to a color with a specific repetition count dictated by that word.",1.0,92,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word zup corresponds to the color yellow, and it seems that other words correspond to colors as well, with wif corresponding to red, dax to green, and walm to yellow. The repetition of the color word in the output matches the number of times the word appears in the input.",1.0,92,zup
"From the provided examples, we can deduce the following rules for the word 'zup' and any additional words that are present:

- When 'zup' is the only input, the output is always ""yellow."" This suggests that the word 'zup' corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

- When 'zup' is followed by another word, the output consists of ""yellow"" followed by one or more colors. The number of color repetitions corresponds to the number of occurrences of each word:

  - 'zup wif walm' results in ""yellow red red red,"" suggesting that 'wif' corresponds to ""red"" and occurs once, while 'walm' also corresponds to ""red"" but is repeated three times.
  
  - 'zup dax' results in ""yellow green,"" suggesting that 'dax' corresponds to ""green.""

  - 'zup walm' results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is slightly contradictory to the earlier example where 'walm' corresponded to ""red."" However, considering the color 'yellow' already corresponds to 'zup', it's possible that when 'walm' is without 'wif', it defaults to the color of 'zup' which is ""yellow,"" and thus is repeated three times.

Based on the examples, the rule for 'zup' seems straightforward, while the rules for the additional words ('wif', 'walm', 'dax') could revolve around their correlation to specific colors and possibly repetition based on some additional unstated rules.

Rule: 
- zup -> 'yellow'
- Additional words can correspond to specific colors and may cause color repetition.
- 'wif' -> 'red'
- 'dax' -> 'green'
- 'walm' -> When paired with 'wif' it results in 'red' being repeated, but on its own, it defaults to the color associated with 'zup' (yellow) and is repeated.",0.7,92,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" is repeated the same number of times as the word immediately preceding it, and it takes the color associated with that preceding word. The rule is consistent across all provided examples:

- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and there is one ""bluf"" after it, which turns into one ""yellow.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red"" as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and it is immediately followed by one ""bluf,"" which becomes one additional ""red.""
- ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" follows the same pattern with ""bluf"" taking the color of the word right before it and being repeated the same number of times. In this case, ""zup bluf"" turns into ""yellow yellow"" and ""lug bluf"" turns into ""blue blue."" Moreover, the sequence ends with ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and that is followed by one ""bluf,"" turning into one ""red.""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" which is again immediately followed by one ""bluf,"" translating into an additional ""red.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" follows the examples above, with ""wif bluf"" turning into ""red red.""

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word that precedes it and appears the same number of times as that word appears immediately before it.",1.0,92,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is the same color twice, repeating the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""bluf"".

Now, let's verify this by looking at the inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""bluf,"" we repeat ""yellow"" once more.

2. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" we repeat ""red"" since ""wif"" came directly before ""bluf.""

3. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" The occurrence of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue,"" and after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow."" The last word, ""wif,"" is not followed by ""bluf,"" so it does not repeat.

4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" we repeat ""red"" once more.

5. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red."" This example is the same as the second one and is consistent with the rule.

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""",1.0,92,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word just before it. Here is the rule derived from the examples:

- In the first example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" Then ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and the following ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"" again; ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and the following ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" as well.
- This pattern is consistent in all given examples.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,92,bluf
"Observing the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the deduced rule along with corroborating evidence from the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- In the second and fifth examples, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" This demonstrates that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) to be repeated.
- In the third example, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red,"" which again, ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it (first ""lug"" [blue], then ""zup"" [yellow]).
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" confirming that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red).

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,92,bluf
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it seems that ""bluf"" is a repeater of the color word that comes just before it. Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is a repetition of the color that precedes ""bluf.""

Here are the mappings based on the examples given:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red.""
- ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats ""blue"" the first time and ""yellow"" the second time.
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats ""red.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" (repeated example) translates to ""blue red red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats ""red"" again.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color word immediately preceding it.",1.0,92,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each input-output pair to identify patterns:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""
2. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
4. ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of walm in the input and their respective outputs:

- In inputs 1, 2, and 5, ""walm"" appears at the end. In the corresponding output, the color of the word appearing just before ""walm"" is repeated three times.
- In input 3, ""walm"" is directly following ""lug,"" and in the output, ""blue"" is repeated three times, reflecting the color associated with ""lug.""
- In input 4, ""walm"" appears twice, once directly after ""lug"" and once after ""zup."" In the output, the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow) are each repeated three times following the same order.

Based on the above observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word in the output three times.",1.0,92,walm
"From the given examples, it can be observed that the word ""walm"" when translated into an output has unique attributes:

- After a single occurrence of ""walm"", the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"", repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the color blue is repeated thrice.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color green is repeated thrice.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the color red is repeated thrice.
- It maintains this pattern even when another instance of ""walm"" follows it, repeating the corresponding color of the word before each instance of ""walm"" three times in the output.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,92,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, multiplying it three times.

Examples:

- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green green.""
- In ""lug walm zup walm,"" the first ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in ""blue blue blue"" for the first ""walm"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" for the second ""walm.""
- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""

So we define the rule as: walm -> meaning. Meaning is a repetition of the color denoted by the preceding word, appearing thrice.",1.0,92,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems the nonce word ""walm"" is translated into repetitions of the color corresponding to the word preceding it. To break this down further, here are the observed corresponding colors for some of the words and the resulting pattern for ""walm"":

- ""lug zup dax walm"" is translated to ""blue yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. So ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" becomes ""red green blue blue blue."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to blue. So ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" reiterating that ""walm"" following ""lug"" (blue) generates ""blue"" three times.
- ""lug walm zup walm"" is ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" first (blue) and then ""zup"" (yellow), each time resulting in three repetitions of the same color.
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" turns into ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with red, and ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

Considering this, ""walm"" seems to mean a repetition of the last mentioned color exactly three times. 

Rule: walm -> a thrice-repeated instance of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""",1.0,92,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color represented by the word immediately preceding it three times. 

- In the first example, ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and thus ""walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In the second example, ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- The third example, ""lug walm,"" directly follows the rule with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" hence is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" So, ""walm"" after ""lug"" becomes ""blue blue blue,"" and ""walm"" after ""zup"" is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" the preceding word to ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red,"" leading to ""red red red"" for the occurrence of ""walm.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Here's the reasoning:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output sequence starts with ""yellow red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output sequence starts with ""red yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output sequence is ""red red.""
- When ""lug"" is surrounded by ""wif"" in the sequence ""lug wif lug wif,"" the output sequence is ""blue red blue red,"" with ""red"" always following ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,93,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,93,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

The consistent element in all examples is that the output includes the color ""red"" whenever the word ""wif"" is present in the input.

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

4. Input: lug wif lug wif lug

5. Input: wif lug

From the examples, it's evident that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The color that corresponds to ""wif"" in all instances is ""red."" Therefore, we can conclude that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,93,wif

Rule: When the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output at the position corresponding to where zup appeared in the input.",1.0,93,zup
"Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Every output sequence concludes with ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is present in the input sequence, independent of its position. The rest of the colors in the output correspond to the specific nonce words before the ""zup"". Therefore:

zup -> yellow",1.0,93,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the position of the word ""zup"" in the input sequence or the words that accompany it, the output always includes the color ""yellow"" following the pattern indicated by the other words.",1.0,93,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should analyze the pairs of input and output, looking specifically for patterns that could be related to the presence of ""zup"" and changes in the sequences of colors in the output.

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- Here, ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and following it, we get a ""yellow,"" which is related to ""zup.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" map to ""red,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively. ""zup"" is followed by a ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the first example.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- ""dax"" and ""walm"" again map to ""green,"" and there is another ""green"" before the ""yellow"" that follows ""zup.""

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow
- Again, ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""bluf"" seems to map to ""green,"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- ""zup"" occurs at the beginning and maps directly to ""yellow,"" followed by the mappings of ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Based on these examples, it appears that ""zup"" directly involves the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is present, the position where it occurs will be mapped to ""yellow."" If ""zup"" is the last word, it will be directly mapped to ""yellow."" If other nonce words follow ""zup,"" those words have their individual mappings added after the ""yellow.""

So we can conclude that the rule for what ""zup"" means in the context of these examples is:
zup -> yellow",1.0,93,zup
"Rule:
Based on the given examples, ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow."" The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output of ""yellow,"" regardless of its position within the input sequence or the context provided by other words.

Therefore:
zup -> yellow",1.0,93,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each instance it appears and its corresponding output.

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" seen in other inputs.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" seen in other inputs.
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and we have ""yellow green.""

2. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
   - We've established ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""
   - Since ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"" and follows ""wif,"" we could assume ""bluf"" takes on the color that precedes it.

3. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and outputs another ""green,"" which may support our assumption.
   - ""wif"" is ""red"" as identified from earlier examples.
   - ""dax"" consistently corresponds with ""green.""

4. ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red"" again, matching our assumption.
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" which remains consistent.

5. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""
   - ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" which we've seen previously.
   - ""bluf"" follows the second ""wif,"" and corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""
   - The pattern remains consistent.

Based on the above analysis, we can infer that ""bluf"" is a rule that takes on the color of the word preceding it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,93,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will first establish the meanings of the other words based on the given examples. Then we will see how ""bluf"" interacts with those words to come up with its meaning.

Let's begin by analyzing the given examples and their outputs:

1. zup bluf dax → yellow yellow green
2. zup wif bluf → yellow red red
3. lug dax bluf wif dax → blue green green red green
4. wif bluf zup → red red yellow
5. wif dax wif bluf zup wif → red green red red yellow red

Firstly, notice the correspondence between:
- ""zup"" and the first yellow in each case where ""zup"" appears.
- ""dax"" causing green repeatedly, either following or preceding another word.
- ""wif"" causing red repeatedly, either following or preceding another word.
- ""lug"" uniquely leading to blue in example 3.

Now, let's inspect the occurrences of ""bluf"" specifically:
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"", the next color is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"", the next color is red.
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", the next color is green.
- When ""bluf"" comes before ""wif"", the color for ""bluf"" is red, the same as ""wif"".
- When ""bluf"" comes before ""zup"", the color for ""bluf"" is yellow, the same as ""zup"".

It appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that either immediately follows or precedes it. Thus, we can infer that the rule for ""bluf"" might be that it copies the output color of the adjacent word (to the right if there is one, otherwise to the left).

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the neighboring word; if it is positioned before another word, it adopts that word's color; if it is at the end, it adopts the color of the preceding word.",0.9,93,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to observe its usage in the various examples and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" yields the output ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and the output is ""red red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"" and the output sequence is ""green green red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" comes after two instances of ""wif"" but before ""zup,"" and the respective sequence is ""red red yellow.""

Looking closely, it appears that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output. However, one pattern does emerge: ""bluf"" tends to take the color of the word that comes before it. 

In the first example, there is no previous color, hence ""bluf"" has a unique color ""green."" In the second, third, and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds with the color ""red."" In the last example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which is ""red"") and produces another ""red"" in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, it defaults to green.",0.8,93,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for what ""bluf"" means by looking at the consistent relationships in the examples. Observing the outputs corresponding to ""bluf"" and the context it is in, we notice that ""bluf"" consistently results in the output ""red"".

This can be confirmed with the given examples. No matter where ""bluf"" appears in the input string, it always corresponds to ""red"" in the output:

- Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green (bluf corresponds to the second yellow, which I will assume is an error and should be red)
- Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red (bluf corresponds to the last red)
- Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green (bluf corresponds to the third green, which I will again assume is an error and should be red)
- Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow (bluf corresponds to the second red)
- Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red (bluf corresponds to the fourth red)

Considering the evidence, and assuming that the colors provided in the examples are accurate outputs for the corresponding inputs except for the anomalies stated, the rule for ""bluf"" can be established as simply being represented by the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red",0.8,93,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf"" we need to analyze its relationship to the outputs. The context does not give us a direct meaning for the word but we can infer the rules based on the examples provided. Here's the analysis for each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is assigned yellow, just like ""zup"".

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and changes the previously assigned red to red, indicating no change in color regardless of the preceding word.

3. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is green and retains the green color.

4. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red and the color assigned is red.

5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which is red and again, ""bluf"" is assigned red.

From the outputs, it seems ""bluf"" is assigned the color of the word that precedes it. If ""zup"" is before ""bluf"", it is yellow. If ""wif"" or ""dax"" or ""lug"" is before ""bluf"", it is the same color as the word before it.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",0.8,93,bluf
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""zup"", but if ""walm"" follows it, ""dax"" changes to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

The word ""walm"" appears to change the color of any word that precedes it to ""red"" with the exception of ""zup"". When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the color remains ""yellow"".

The rule that seems to be consistent with the examples given is:

Rule: If ""walm"" follows any word except ""zup"", change the output color of the preceding word(s) to ""red"". If ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", ""zup"" remains ""yellow"".

Therefore:
walm -> Changes preceding word outputs to ""red"", except for ""zup"" which remains ""yellow"".",1.0,93,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,93,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the output color sequence always ends with a series of the same color immediately following the word ""walm"". The word that comes before ""walm"" does not appear to influence what the color is (it can be ""zup"", ""dax, ""wif"", or none), so the rule is not dependent on the preceding word. However, the number of times the color is repeated in the output corresponds to the number of words after ""walm"" in the input. In the cases where ""walm"" is the last word, the color is repeated three times (except for the single instance where ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and produces ""red red"" as the output). It's reasonable to assume that ""walm"" signifies repeating the last color mentioned before it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the last color mentioned before ""walm"" in the output, for as many times as there were words after ""walm"" in the input, with a minimum of repeating it twice. If ""walm"" is the last word, it defaults to repeating the color three times.",0.8,93,walm
"Observing the examples:

1. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
2. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. wif walm -> red red red

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the word that comes after it to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" 

For example:
- In ""zup walm dax,"" the color yellow for ""zup"" is repeated twice after ""walm"" before changing to green for ""dax.""
- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" the color yellow for ""zup"" is repeated twice after ""walm"" before reverting back to blue for the second ""lug.""
- In ""zup dax walm,"" the color green for ""dax"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the color red for ""wif"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- In ""wif walm,"" the color red for ""wif"" is repeated twice after ""walm.""

Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" means ""blue.""",1.0,94,lug
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,94,dax

"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples given, each instance of the word ""dax"" correlates with the word ""green"" in the output. The repetition of ""dax lug"" with the consistent output ""green blue"" further supports this rule. Regardless of its position in the sequence or what words follow, ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green.""",1.0,94,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the correlation between the input and the output in each example.

From the first input-output pair:

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red

We see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" except when it follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

From the second and third:

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

In both cases, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

From the fourth:

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" again with ""green.""

From the fifth:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems also to be ""blue.""

In all the input and output pairs, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green."" No context or position changes its output. Therefore, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,94,dax
Rule: dax -> green.,1.0,94,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates to a specific color when used in conjunction with other words. By examining the consistent patterns, it's possible to deduce the meaning of ""wif.""

Looking at each usage of ""wif"" and its corresponding output color:

- In the first example, when ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is both preceded by and followed by ""dax,"" and both instances produce ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" and the output is ""red yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" and the output is ""yellow red green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red.""

From these examples, we can assume that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is true regardless of whether ""wif"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence. Each time ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is the associated output.

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,94,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the input and the corresponding output in each given example:

1. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf   
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

2. Input: wif dax wif   
   Output: red green red

3. Input: wif zup   
   Output: red yellow

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug   
   Output: yellow red green green blue

5. Input: wif bluf   
   Output: red red

Observations:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The other words (dax, zup, bluf, walm, lug) are associated with colors other than red (green for dax, yellow for zup, etc.).
- The output color depends solely on the input word. There's a one-to-one mapping between each non-wif word and its corresponding color.
- ""wif"" is consistent across all examples in mapping to red, despite the other words.

Based on the observations above, it is clear that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,94,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,94,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is directly associated with the color ""red."" Regardless of which other words it is paired with (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" etc.), when ""wif"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""

Thus, we can write the rule as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,94,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,94,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently correlates to the output ""yellow."" It does not matter whether ""zup"" appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the input; the output consistently includes the color ""yellow"" in the position corresponding to ""zup."" Hence, we deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,94,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,94,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,94,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in each output. In every example, regardless of the context or position, ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,94,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze each example and identify patterns in the color output.

1. **Input**: zup wif bluf zup lug  
   **Output**: yellow red red yellow blue  
   In this sequence, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and given that it appears twice consecutively, resulting in ""red red,"" we can infer ""bluf"" also translates to ""red."" ""Lug"" at the end translates to ""blue.""

2. **Input**: zup  
   **Output**: yellow  
   In this instance, ""zup"" alone translates directly to ""yellow.""

3. **Input**: wif zup  
   **Output**: red yellow  
   This sequence further supports that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

4. **Input**: wif dax zup  
   **Output**: red green yellow  
   Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is a new word which translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow.""

5. **Input**: zup bluf dax  
   **Output**: yellow yellow green  
   ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"" as established before. Notice that ""bluf,"" which was previously associated with ""red,"" now corresponds to ""yellow."" This change suggests that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed color translation but instead depends on context. However, ""dax"" appears to reliably translate to ""green.""

From these examples, we consistently see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in every context provided. The word ""bluf"" seems more ambiguous, but based on the first example, it initially appeared to mean ""red"" before later examples showed it resulting in ""yellow."" Without additional context or examples where ""bluf"" leads to a different color, it's challenging to define a rule for it.

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""",1.0,94,zup
"bluf -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""bluf"" means repeating the color mentioned before it.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is the same color word repeated.",1.0,94,bluf
"bluf -> same color as the previous word. Rule: When ""bluf"" appears after a word, it takes the color that the previous word is associated with.",1.0,94,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf seems to be that it is a duplicating word which, when following another word, causes the output to repeat the color associated with that preceding word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows any word, the color that corresponds to that word is repeated in the output.",1.0,94,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. For instance, if ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" ""lug bluf"" would be ""blue blue.""

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it and repeats that color.",1.0,94,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the same color as the word preceding it. 

Therefore, the rule is:

Bluf -> The same color as the preceding word.",1.0,94,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns associated with each input and output pair:

- In the first example, each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. ""walm wif"" gives ""green red,"" meaning ""walm"" makes the next word generate the same color as the previous word (green).
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" which output ""red green"" and ""blue blue,"" respectively. This reinforces the deduction from the first example—a repeat in color from the previous word.
- The third example shows ""wif walm dax"" leading to ""red red red green,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the next word, ""dax,"" to repeat the color of ""wif"" (red).
- The fourth example, ""wif walm,"" results in ""red red red,"" again implying the repetition of ""wif's"" color in place of ""walm.""
- Lastly, the fifth example, ""dax walm,"" outputs ""green green green."" Like before, ""walm” is repeating the output color of ""dax.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it causes the next word to repeat the output color of the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

Therefore: walm -> Causes the next word's assigned color to repeat the previous word's color.",1.0,94,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems straightforward. It appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times.

For example:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and the output is ""green green green.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output is ""red red red,"" and later it follows ""lug"" (blue), producing ""blue blue blue.""
- The third example again shows that ""walm"" following ""wif"" (red) results in ""red red red.""
- The fourth example has ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" without another word after ""walm,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" indicating it doesn't need a subsequent word to determine its repetition.
- Lastly, when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" regardless of whether there's a word after ""walm"" or not.

Rule: walm -> The rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times.",1.0,94,walm
"Observing the examples given, here's what can be inferred:

In the first example, after the sequence ""lug dax zup dax"", the word ""walm"" is introduced, and the color sequence becomes ""green green red"". However, before ""walm"", the sequence ""lug dax zup dax"" maps to ""blue green yellow green"". It seems that ""walm"" somehow causes the colors to change from their original mapping.

Similarly, in the second example, the word ""walm"" appears twice. Each time after ""walm"", there is a repetition of the color ""red"", even though the previous words (""wif"", ""lug"") mapped to different colors (""red"", ""blue"").

The third and fourth examples further illustrate that the presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in a repetition of the color ""red"".

Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", meaning ""walm"" again causes a repetition of the previously mentioned color.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the previous color in the sequence.",1.0,94,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word the number of times based on how many times ""walm"" appears consecutively. 

For example:
- In the first input, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- In the second input, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" is said twice after it.
- The repetition rule still applies when ""walm"" is at the beginning of the sequence, as seen in ""wif walm"", where the color red associated with ""wif"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows it.",1.0,94,walm
"walm -> meaning. From the given examples, we can observe that the word ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat the color of the previous word. Therefore, ""walm"" functions as a repeater.

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is translated as ""red"", and therefore ""walm"" results in repeated ""red"".
  
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.

- In the third example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" is translated to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". The ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"", thus ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". Each ""walm"" follows a color (first ""green"", then ""blue"") and repeats it three times.

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which is ""blue"", leading to a triple ""blue"".

Rule: walm-> meaning. ""walm"" means the repetition of the prior mentioned color three times.

Hence, the rule is: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, it repeats the color that word represents three times in sequence.",1.0,95,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns associated with its use in the provided examples. Let's examine each example and its output closely:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   
In this output sequence, every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" except the last instance of ""lug"" following ""walm,"" which turns into ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" may change the color associated with ""lug"" from blue to red.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
Here, ""dax"" without ""walm"" would presumably result in one ""green,"" but with ""walm"" following ""dax,"" the output is three ""green."" This might indicate that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   
In this example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results again in repeated ""blue."" This reinforces the repetition rule suggested in the previous example. ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" as expected. 

4. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   
This sequence further supports the rule that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. After ""dax,"" we have three ""green"" and after ""lug,"" we have three ""blue.""

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   
Following the established pattern, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" but ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times before the sequence continues with ""green"" for ""dax.""

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous nonce word to be repeated three times.",1.0,95,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding nonce word an additional two times. Here are the instances where ""walm"" is used and how it transforms the output:

1. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> lug is blue, so walm after wif causes two more reds before the last lug which is blue.
2. dax walm -> dax is green, so walm repeats green two more times.
3. zup lug walm wif dax -> lug is blue, so walm repeats blue two more times.
4. dax walm zup lug walm -> the first walm follows dax and thus repeats green two more times; the second walm follows lug and repeats blue two more times.
5. lug walm dax -> lug is blue, so walm repeats blue two more times before moving on to dax which is green.

Given the data, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two more times.",1.0,95,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern for the nonce word ""walm"":

- Whenever ""walm"" follows the word ""lug,"" the output is a sequence of ""red"" followed by a sequence of ""blue.""
- Whenever ""walm"" follows the word ""dax,"" the output is a sequence of ""green.""
- The number of colored outputs corresponds to the number of nonce words preceding ""walm.""
- ""Walm"" does not seem to dictate a specific color but rather a sequence of colors based on the word preceding it.
- The word that comes after ""walm"" does not affect the output of ""walm.""

Using this pattern, we can formulate the following rule:

walm -> A sequence of colors that is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm."" If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""red"" followed by ""blue"" until the end of the sequence. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""green."" The number of repetitions corresponds to the overall count of words excluding ""walm"" itself.

Rule: 
If the preceding word is ""lug,"" walm results in ""red"" followed by ""blue"" until the end of the sequence. The number of ""red"" and ""blue"" repetitions will be equal to the count of words before ""walm,"" not including ""walm.""
If the preceding word is ""dax,"" walm results in repetitions of ""green"" equal to the count of words before ""walm,"" not including ""walm.""",0.8,95,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents the repetition of the last color mentioned before it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug"" represents blue, and right before ""walm,"" we see ""lug wif"" which translates to ""blue red"". Therefore, ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""

- In the second example, there's a single ""dax"" before ""walm,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Therefore, ""walm"" turns into ""green green green.""

- In the third example, the last color mentioned is ""lug"" which represents blue, followed by ""wif dax,"" leading to ""blue red green."" ""Walm"" then repeats the recent color sequence without the initial blue (as that's a repetition from lug), resulting in ""blue blue blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" follows the rule previously identified, resulting in ""green green green,"" and ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue.""

- Finally, in the fifth example, we have ""lug walm dax."" Following the rule, since ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" repeats the blue, and ""dax"" introduces a new color, green, hence ""blue blue blue green.""

Therefore, the rule is: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color(s) the number of times they were mentioned before ""walm"" until the next color or end of sequence.

"Analyzing the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input sentence, ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" in the output sequence. Therefore, the following rule can be deduced:

Meaning: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output is ""green.""",1.0,96,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green.",1.0,96,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The output is not influenced by the words that precede or follow ""dax"" within the sequences. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,96,dax
"Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" and any other rules that can be inferred for the other words within the examples.

Here's what we can observe:
- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output always contains the word ""green.""
- No matter the position of ""dax"" within the input string, the output position for ""green"" corresponds to where ""dax"" is located.
- ""dax"" does not seem to change its meaning based on context; it is always directly represented by ""green"" in the output.

Based on the examples provided, we can determine the following:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- walm -> blue
- lug -> blue

The outputs are directly correlated with the input words, and each word translates to a specific color. With the given data, the rule appears to be that each word directly corresponds to a specific color output, irrespective of position or combination with other words.

Rule: dax -> green

""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input.",1.0,96,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the output color ""green"". It does not seem to depend on its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule can be established as:

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""green"".",1.0,96,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" has a consistent translation to ""red"". In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always includes the color ""red"" in the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,96,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" is outputted. Furthermore, other words correspond to different colors—such as ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow.""

However, there may be a conflict or typo in the examples, as ""wif"" and ""walm"" both output ""red"" but are different words. Assuming this is not an error, it's possible that two different words could mean the same color in different contexts. Without additional information or examples, it is difficult to deduce if there is a more complex rule at play.

Given the information we have, the simplest rule we can extract is:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,96,wif
"Based on the examples provided where the input ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red,"" we can make the following deduction:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,96,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the inputs and the outputs. Let's break down each example.

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds directly to ""red.""

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   We know ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The new word ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

4. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   From the previous examples, we know ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   With ""zup"" being ""yellow"" and ""wif"" being ""red,"" this follows the previously seen pattern.

Based on these examples, we see that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input list. Thus the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,96,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the given examples and the associated outputs closely:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

4. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

In every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is always ""red."" This consistent mapping suggests that the meaning of the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red.

"bluf -> the color associated with the preceding word. Rule:

- If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then bluf translates to ""red red.""
- If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then bluf translates to ""green green.""
- If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then bluf translates to ""yellow yellow.""

Thus, bluf repeats the color linked to the word that comes before it twice.",1.0,96,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with the output of repeating the color that corresponds to the previous word in the input. Each unique word preceding ""bluf"" consistently yields the same color repeated twice in the output. Here are the associations based on the examples:

- The word ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red red.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green green.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently leads to ""yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it, twice.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,96,bluf
"bluf -> color of the object before it.

Rule: If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""

"Based on the examples given, we can infer the following consistent pattern: 

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".

There is a direct mapping from the first word to the color repeated twice. Each instance of ""bluf"" following a particular word results in the same color being repeated in the output. This suggests that ""bluf"" acts as a signal to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word. Therefore, the word ""bluf"" itself does not correspond to a specific color but rather to the rule of repetition of color assigned to the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> indicates to repeat the color associated with the preceding word twice.",1.0,96,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern that seems to correlate the word before ""bluf"" with a specific color in the output. Here is the breakdown of the given examples, which leads to the rule:

- wif bluf -> red red. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output color is red twice.
- dax bluf -> green green. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output color is green twice.
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output color is yellow twice.

It appears that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the assigned color for the word before it. Therefore:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the previous word and duplicates it in the output.",0.9,96,bluf
"By examining each string of inputs alongside their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the rule for ""walm"". The rule seems to directly correlate with the translation of each input term into a specific color in the output. Here is the breakdown:

1. Every instance of ""lug"" is followed by blue in the output.
2. Every instance of ""zup"" is followed by yellow in the output.
3. Every instance of ""wif"" is followed by red in the output.
4. Every instance of ""dax"" is followed by green in the output.

Now focusing on instances of ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"" and before ""zup"", and the output is ""blue blue blue yellow"". Given that ""lug"" translates to blue and ""zup"" to yellow, we can infer that ""walm"" also translates to blue here.
   
2. In the second example, ""walm"" occurs twice, and each time it translates to blue in the output confirming the deduction from the first instance.

3. The third and fourth examples further confirm the rule since both times ""walm"" is in the input, it consistently corresponds to blue in the output.

In all cases, the term ""walm"" correlates to blue in the output, no matter its position in the string.

Therefore, the rule is:
walm -> meaning: blue",1.0,96,walm

1. ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow""
2. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red""

4. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
5. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""

With these examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the output includes an instance of the color ""blue."" Additionally, each other word seems to correspond to a different color:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

It is important to notice that the sequence of ""walm"" corresponds to the output color blue repeating itself the same number of times as the word ""walm"" appears. It does not appear to change based on context or position in the sentence.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> blue",1.0,96,walm

"Based on the examples provided, the output is a sequence of colors that correspond to the input words. To decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the input and corresponding output sequences.

   - ""walm"" occurs twice after ""lug"", and both instances produce ""blue""

3. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

5. Input: zup walm wif

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow""

After examining these examples, we can see that whenever ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" but when it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" It seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding word: After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" results in a ""blue"" output. After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" results in a ""yellow"" output.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the color is blue, if it is ""zup,"" the color is yellow. It is possible that it takes the color of other preceding words as well, but there are no examples to confirm this.",1.0,96,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue."" When we see ""lug"" in the input, ""blue"" is always in the corresponding output. Additionally, ""lug"" does not seem to modify the meaning of the words that come before or after it; it merely adds ""blue"" to the sequence. Other words like ""wif"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. 

Moreover, the order of the words in the input corresponds to the order of the colors in the output. For instance, ""dax lug wif"" leads to ""green blue red,"" maintaining the sequence. If a word is repeated, such as in ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" its related color is also repeated in the output.

Rule: lug -> ""blue""",1.0,97,lug

4. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue (Other words like ""wif"", ""walm"", ""dax"", ""zup"" correspond to ""red"", ""blue"", and ""green"" respectively. But ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".)

Thus, lug -> blue.",1.0,97,lug

4. Input: ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" - Output: ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""
5. Input: ""dax lug wif"" - Output: ""green blue red""

While ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in every instance where it appears. It does not matter whether ""lug"" is preceded by ""wif"" or ""dax,"" the output is still ""blue."" The position of ""lug,"" whether it's at the start, middle, or end of the sequence, also does not affect its output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,97,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we examine each pair of inputs and outputs to look for patterns. Let's analyze them:

1. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue.""
2. ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue.""

   - The word ""bluf"" corresponds to an additional ""blue"" in the output when added after ""lug.""
4. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" translates to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue.""
   - ""walm"" after ""lug"" adds two additional ""blue"" in the output.
5. ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red.""
   - The word ""wif"" after ""lug"" does not result in any additional ""blue"" in the output.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and any subsequent color words after ""lug"" are repeated. However, when ""lug"" is not immediately followed by a color word, it does not cause the repetition effect. This doesn't explain the situation in example 4 perfectly, as ""walm"" is not directly after ""lug,"" but the pattern seems consistent in other examples.

Rule:
lug -> blue (with a possible repetition effect for subsequent color words immediately following ""lug"")",0.8,97,lug
"Rule: dax -> green

- The number of occurrences of ""walm"" in the input results in the same number of ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""walm"" does not change the color associated with other words; for example, ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". The number of times ""yellow"" appears is equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears.

Rule: walm -> yellow. Every instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to an output of ""yellow.""",1.0,97,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided for when ""walm"" is used and the corresponding output:

1. Presence of ""walm"":
   - Example 1: ""wif walm zup"" -> Output has one ""red,"" followed by three ""red"" for ""walm"" and one ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
   - Example 2: ""wif dax zup walm"" -> Output has one ""red,"" one ""green"" for ""dax,"" one ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" followed by three ""yellow"" for ""walm.""
   - Example 3: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> Output has one ""red,"" three ""red"" for ""walm,"" one ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" one ""blue"" for ""lug,"" one ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and three ""yellow"" for ""walm.""
   - Example 4: ""lug walm zup walm"" -> Output has one ""blue"" for ""lug,"" three ""blue"" for ""walm,"" one ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and three ""yellow"" for ""walm.""
   - Example 5: ""lug walm dax"" -> Output has one ""blue"" for ""lug,"" three ""blue"" for ""walm,"" and one ""green"" for ""dax.""

2. Consistency across examples:
   - Whenever ""walm"" appears, there are three of the same color following it.
   - The color that follows ""walm"" is the same as the color that would have been assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
   - Example 1 has ""walm"" following ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" resulting in three ""red.""
   - Example 4 has ""walm"" following ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" resulting in three ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, and this repetition occurs three times.

Rule: walm -> Triggers three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"".",1.0,97,walm
"Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs suggests that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with a repeated sequence of the color ""yellow."" The number of yellow outputs increases in consecutive order each time ""walm"" is included in the input.

Let's further examine the relationship between the positions of 'walm' in the inputs and the yellow outputs:

- Input: wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow
  (Single 'walm' leads to a single yellow)

- Input: wif dax zup walm | Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
  (Single 'walm' at the end leads to three yellows)

- Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm | Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
  (First 'walm' leads to one yellow, second 'walm' leads to three yellows)

- Input: lug walm zup walm | Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
  (First 'walm' leads to one yellow, second 'walm' leads to two additional yellows)

- Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green
  (Single 'walm' leads to no yellow as it is followed by 'dax' instead of 'zup')

From these observations, we can determine the following rule for ""walm"":

""walm"" following ""zup"" generates a sequence of ""yellow"" outputs, with the number of yellows increasing in relation to the number of times ""walm"" has been used consecutively in the input sequence. When ""walm"" is not directly followed by ""zup,"" there is no yellow produced in the output.

Rule: walm -> when following the word ""zup,"" outputs an increasing sequence of the color ""yellow."" When not followed by ""zup,"" it does not correspond to ""yellow"" in the output.",0.8,97,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:

1. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
2. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""

We can see that each word in the input is translated to a color in the output. The words ""wif"" and ""lug"" consistently correspond to the colors red and blue, respectively. The word ""zup"" results in the color yellow. The word ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Now let's focus on the word ""walm"":
- In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and corresponds with red.
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow) and results in three instances of yellow.
- In the third example, ""walm"" appears twice - the first instance after ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow) corresponds with a single yellow and the second time after ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue), leading to two more instances of yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and results in a double yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and corresponds with green.

When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), the word ""zup"" (yellow) appears in the output as if ""walm"" doesn't change the sequence, meaning that ""walm"" by itself could be directly translated to yellow. However, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" an additional yellow is introduced, suggesting an incremental or duplicative effect. When ""walm"" appears before ""dax"" (green) and after ""lug"" (blue), it doesn't seem to affect the output for ""dax.""

Considering the evidence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it mostly corresponds with the color yellow, potentially adding additional instances of yellow based on its position or the context of surrounding words.

4. Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green
5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif -> Output: blue green yellow green green green red

It seems that each word has a corresponding color output. To isolate the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns linked exclusively to its presence:

- When ""wif"" appears as the first word, the first color is red (Examples 1 and 4).
- When ""wif"" appears in other positions (not the first), the color for ""wif"" is red (Examples 2, 3, and 5).
- When ""wif"" repeats, as in example 2, the repeated ""wif"" continues to give a red output.

Given that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,98,wif

- Whenever the word 'wif' appears, the corresponding output is 'red'.

We can deduce that 'wif' consistently corresponds to 'red', regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,98,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we need to look for patterns in the correspondences between the input and output pairs.

Looking at the first example:
- Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
- Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" to another ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

Looking at the second example:
- Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""bluf"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The introduction of ""zup"" aligns with a new color ""yellow"", and the second ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".

The third example:
- Input: lug dax wif -> Output: blue green red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".

The fourth example:
- Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and the second ""dax"" still to ""green"".

The last example:
- Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif -> Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", the second ""dax"" still to ""green"", ""walm"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".

From these examples, it is consistently seen that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,98,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond directly with the color ""yellow."" No matter the context, whenever ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

- ""walm"" appears between ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red) and converts to ""blue""

So ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine the color outputs that correspond to the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" in each example.

1) When ""dax wif walm"" is the input, the output is ""green red red red."" The colors corresponding to ""dax"" and ""wif"" are green and red, respectively. ""Walm"" in this context repeats the color red three times.

2) With ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" the nonce word ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, and the output is ""red red red"" immediately after the previous ""wif.""

3) For ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the output after ""wif"" is again ""red red red,"" which implies that ""walm"" results in a repetition of red three times.

4) In ""dax lug walm,"" the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color that corresponds to ""lug.""

5) Finally, ""dax walm zup lug"" has ""walm"" immediately after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" repeating the color for ""dax.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding color-coded word to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three more times.",1.0,98,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the color outputs in relation to the presence of ""walm"" in the input sentences:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (which translates to ""red""), the output is a repetition of ""red"" three times.
2. Irrespective of the words preceding ""walm"" (whether ""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""zup""), the color immediately following ""walm"" in the output repeats itself thrice, except for example 5 where it repeats twice.

However, this anomaly in the fifth input might be explained by how ""walm"" appears in the sequence of input words. Since ""walm"" is followed by other words (""zup lug""), it seems that its effect—repetition of the color—is terminated by the subsequent words. Therefore, ""walm"" might be causing the next color to repeat a number of times equivalent to the number of words following ""walm"" (including ""walm"" itself) up until the next word. In the fifth example, there are three words after ""walm,"" so the resulting color (""green"") is repeated twice, perhaps the next word ""zup"" breaks the pattern established by ""walm.""

Based on these observations, one can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to repeat a number of times. If there are no following words, the color repeats thrice. If there are additional words following ""walm,"" the repetition seems to be constrained by the number of additional words plus one until the pattern is broken by a subsequent word.

Thus, we can define ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> a command to repeat the next color in the sequence a number of times, typically three if it is the last word before the colors are listed, or a number tied to the number of following terms plus one, until interrupted by another word.",0.8,98,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input and its corresponding output, looking for patterns that correlate with the appearance of ""walm.""

1. Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red
4. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
5. Input: dax walm zup lug -> Output: green green green yellow blue

Now, let's observe:

- ""walm"" always results in a sequence of colors where the last color repeats multiple times.
- The number of times the last color repeats appears to be one more than the number of words following ""walm.""
    - Example 1: No words after walm so ""red"" occurs three times.
    - Example 2: One word after walm so ""red"" occurs three times.
    - Example 3: No words after walm so ""red"" occurs three times.
    - Example 4: No words after walm so ""blue"" occurs three times. 
    - Example 5: Two words after walm so ""green"" occurs three times.
- The color that repeats is the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm.""

Using these observations, we can now deduce the rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to repeat one additional time for every word following ""walm,"" plus two more repetitions, effectively removing those words and replacing them with the repeated color.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color once for every word following ""walm,"" plus two additional repetitions. If ""walm"" is the last word, repeat the previous color three times.",0.8,98,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correspond to a series of color outputs that mirror the series of words preceding ""walm."" Here is the pattern deduced from the examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" to red. After ""walm,"" we get ""red"" repeated, which is the color associated with the word right before ""walm"" (in this case, ""wif"").

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   Rule: Colors are given for each word and after ""walm,"" the color associated with ""wif"" is repeated three times as ""walm"" is following two instances of ""wif.""

3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   Rule: Again, colors precede ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" we see the color corresponding to ""wif"" which precedes ""walm"" repeated three times.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm,"" the color associated with ""lug"" is repeated three times.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   Rule: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which is green) and hence the color green is repeated three times after ""walm,"" before proceeding to the colors for ""zup"" and ""lug.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color three times in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output sequence.",0.8,98,walm
"Examining the input and output sequences, let's look for a pattern that corresponds to the nonce word ""walm"":

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

The pattern appears to suggest that ""walm"" refers to repeating the color associated with the last word before ""walm"", for as many times as that word's color has been mentioned in the sequence up to that point, including the current sequence.

Let's apply this rule to each sequence to see if it fits:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and it has been mentioned once before ""walm"". Therefore, ""walm"" results in ""red red red"" (three times because ""wif"" has appeared a second time).
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and has been mentioned twice before ""walm"". Therefore, ""walm"" results in ""red red red red red"" (five times since ""wif"" has appeared a third time).
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and has been mentioned twice before ""walm"". Therefore, ""walm"" results in ""red red red red red"" (five times since ""wif"" has appeared a third time).
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and it has been mentioned once before ""walm"". Therefore, ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (three times because ""lug"" has appeared a second time).
5. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and it has been mentioned once before ""walm"". Therefore, ""walm"" causes ""green green"" (repeated for a total of three times since ""dax"" has appeared a second time).

However, this pattern slightly breaks down for the second and third examples, where ""walm"" does not repeat five times as we would expect from the mentioned rule. This may imply there could be a limit to how many times ""walm"" repeats a color regardless of the previous occurrences of the corresponding word. Still, in essence, it seems clear that ""walm"" repeats the previous color a variable number of times based on the input context.

Given this information and the slight inconsistency in repetition count in the second and third examples, a more tentative rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"", repeating the color as many times as that word (or its color) has been mentioned in the sequence, subject to an observed maximum number of four repetitions.

Note that this rule accounts for a maximum of four repetitions, as seen in the output of the second example (since including ""red"" itself would make five mentions). More data would be needed to refine this rule further.",0.7,98,walm

4. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" translates to ""blue blue green green."" It appears ""bluf"" follows the color of the word before it, being ""blue"" after ""lug,"" and ""green"" after ""dax.""

5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow,"" following the pattern of matching the color of the preceding word.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" matches the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,99,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning or pattern associated with the nonce word ""bluf."" By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can identify what ""bluf"" corresponds to in each case.

In the first example:
- Input: zup wif bluf
- Output: yellow red red

In the second example:
- Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
- Output: green blue yellow red red green

In the third example:
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
- Output: green green red yellow blue

In the fourth example:
- Input: lug bluf dax bluf
- Output: blue blue green green

In the fifth example:
- Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
- Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Examining these examples, the pattern for ""bluf"" seems to be that it corresponds to the color word immediately preceding it. Specifically, ""bluf"" seems to 'repeat' or 'duplicate' the color mentioned before it. Let's verify with each instance:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red.""
2. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow red red green."" Again, ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red.""
3. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green.""
4. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" translates to ""blue blue green green."" ""Bluf"" repeats ""blue"" first and then ""green.""
5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,99,bluf
"Given the patterns presented in the examples, we can try to induce the rule by looking at the correspondences between the nonce word ""bluf"" and the outputs it generates.

From the given examples:

- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
- dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
- dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
- lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
- zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

We can observe that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" except in the last example, where it corresponds to ""yellow."" Looking closely, we notice that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it: ""wif"" leads to red, ""dax"" leads to green, ""lug"" leads to blue, and ""zup"" leads to yellow. This is consistent in all cases except where ""bluf"" is the last word, in which case it seems to repeat the last mentioned color.

Thus the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it, or repeats the last mentioned color if it is the final word.

- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red (red from ""wif"")
- dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green (red from ""wif"")
- dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue (green from preceding ""dax"")
- lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green (first ""green"" from preceding ""dax"", second ""green"" from itself because it is also preceded by ""dax"")
- zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow (yellow from preceding ""zup"")

Hence:

bluf -> The color of the word immediately before it, or repeats the last mentioned color if it is the last word.",1.0,99,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""yellow."" Therefore, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,99,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each input:

1. Input: ""zup wif bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow red red""
2. Input: ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> Output: ""green blue yellow red red green""
3. Input: ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> Output: ""green green red yellow blue""
4. Input: ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> Output: ""blue blue green green""
5. Input: ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow""

Analyzing the patterns:

- In example 1, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" it seems ""bluf"" might also be ""red.""
- In example 2, ignoring the already known words, the first ""bluf"" is followed by ""red.""
- In example 3, the first ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" also, despite the different position in the sequence.
- In example 4, each ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" but considering the ""dax"" is also mapped to ""green,"" this doesn't necessarily give a clear indication of ""bluf's"" meaning.
- In example 5, the sequence ends with ""bluf,"" and the corresponding output sequence ends with ""yellow."" Since ""zup"" is also mapped to ""yellow,"" this suggests that ""bluf"" could indeed be ""yellow"" when it's at the end of the sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" represents a color, and its output color could depend on its position in the sequence or the context provided by the surrounding words.

However, since we have two occurrences where ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" and one occurrence where ""bluf"" is at the end and is represented by ""yellow,"" it's difficult to ascertain a consistent rule just from the examples provided.

Yet, the last example indicates that ""bluf"" may represent ""yellow"" when at the end of a sequence, as it corresponds with the output color for ""zup.""

So, the tentative rule based on example 5 could be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence, it represents the color ""yellow."" Otherwise, the color it represents might change depending on other factors not clearly determined from the examples.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: potentially represents the color ""yellow"" when at the end of a sequence; otherwise, its color representation is uncertain.",0.5,99,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for common patterns in the examples given.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" appears first in sequence and produces ""green""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and also produces ""green""
- ""wif"" produces ""red""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and produces ""yellow""
- ""wif"" produces ""red""
- ""walm"" is the last in the sequence and produces ""red""

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" produces ""red""
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and produces ""red""
- ""dax"" is the last in sequence and produces ""green""

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces ""yellow""
- ""dax"" after ""walm"" produces ""green""
- ""lug"" after ""dax"" and at the end of the sequence produces ""blue""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and produces ""red""
- ""walm"" is the last in the sequence and produces ""red""

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output. Instead, its output seems to depend on its position and the words around it. 

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup,"" it takes on the color of the word that precedes it.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or is the last word in the sequence, it produces ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it outputs the color of the word that precedes it unless it follows ""wif"" or is the last word in the sequence, in which case it outputs ""red.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word, but outputs ""red"" if following ""wif"" or at the end of a sequence.",0.8,99,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare each sentence and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first and third inputs, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the outputs following ""wif"" are three consecutive reds.
- In the second input, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and again, the output for ""wif"" and ""walm"" is a sequence of reds.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" the output sequence has three yellows followed by a green.
- On the fifth input, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" transitioning from a yellow to red, with two additional reds following.

From these observations, it's clear that ""walm"" influences the outputs to repeat the color that immediately precedes it three times. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color red is repeated three times. When it follows ""zup,"" the color yellow precedes it is repeated. However, when ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" it isn't clear if ""walm"" repeats green or if ""dax"" is always green since there's no instance of ""dax"" not being green in the provided examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to be output three times.",0.8,99,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, let's first observe the color output when the word ""walm"" is present:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" in a sequence that starts with ""zup,"" the output is red red red.
4. And when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the next word's output is also affected (""dax"" -> green, creating ""yellow yellow yellow green"").

Based on these observations, we notice that ""walm"" seems to affect not only its own output but also the output of the following word, except when ""walm"" is the last word. Also, the effect of ""walm"" seems to primarily depend on the word that precedes it. We can hypothesize a rule about ""walm"" as follows:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in the color green.
- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in the color red, and it also turns the subsequent word red if there is one.
- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""walm"" appears to maintain the color for ""zup"" which is yellow and makes the next word green if it's ""dax"" (but we only have one example of this).

Let's articulate this into a rule:

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" depends on the preceding word. It seems to adopt the corresponding color pattern when preceded by certain words and can affect the color of the following word:
- After ""dax,"" it and the word following ""walm"" turn green.
- After ""wif,"" it and potentially the next word (if there is one) turn red.
- After ""zup,"" the color pattern maintains yellow, and if followed by ""dax,"" the next word turns green.",0.8,99,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider the outputs corresponding to each instance where ""walm"" appears and look for a pattern.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Here, ""walm"" coincides with the second ""green"" in the output.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""walm"" occurs after ""wif,"" and the output for both is ""red red.""

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again and takes on the color ""red,"" and there is an extra ""red"" following it.

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""walm"" is in between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" corresponding to extra ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- Just like before, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and both produce ""red"" with an additional ""red.""

The key observations are:
1. ""walm"" tends to produce an additional instance of the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it.
2. ""walm"" appears to elongate the color pattern.

Based on the consistency of these results, it seems that ""walm"" leads to the duplication of the color associated with the previous word in the output. When ""wif"" is red and it precedes ""walm,"" the output is red red, indicating duplication.

Rule: walm -> causes the duplication of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.",0.8,99,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll analyze the common patterns in each example where the word appears and the corresponding outputs.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" is followed by three greens, so ""dax"" could mean ""green.""
- ""wif"" leads to a red at the end.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" is followed by two yellows.
- ""bluf"" leads to red.
- The sequence ""wif walm"" leads to two reds.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" leads to red.
- ""walm dax"" results in red green.

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""zup"" leads to two yellows.
- ""walm dax"" results in yellow green.
- ""lug"" by itself is blue.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" leads to yellow.
- The sequence ""wif walm"" results in three reds.

From the above examples, we can try to draw some conclusions:

1. ""zup"" may stand for yellow by itself as every time ""zup"" is present at the beginning, a yellow appears in the output.
2. ""dax"" seems to represent green, but when it follows ""walm,"" it leads to red followed by green.
3. ""wif"" consistently leads to red.
4. ""walm"" doesn't have a consistent color output by itself; instead, it seems to affect the color that comes after it. For example, after ""walm,"" ""dax"" leads to green but is preceded by a red. When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" we see a sequence of reds.

Considering these patterns, ""walm"" appears to be a modifier that may introduce an additional red and potentially modify the output color of the word that follows it.

"Rule: dax -> green

"Rule: dax -> green

"Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the relationship between the input and the output to determine the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax.""

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to either ""green"" or ""red"" in the output, so it does not represent a single, unchanging color.
2. But looking at the pattern, ""dax"" takes a color in the output that is the same as the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it in the next instance of ""dax."" For instance, in the first input, ""lug"" precedes the first ""dax"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is followed by ""blue"" in the output. In the second example, ""wif"" comes before ""dax,"" and ""red"" follows in the output.

From these observations, I can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color that is associated with the word immediately following the next occurrence of ""dax."" If ""dax"" is the last word or there is no subsequent occurrence of ""dax,"" it defaults to green.

Thus: dax -> green or the color of the following word after the next ""dax"".",0.8,100,dax

- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color word that comes before it, so it also translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" because ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color word, resulting in another ""red"".
- In contexts where ""bluf"" is between two different color words (like ""lug bluf wif""), it repeats the one that comes directly before it (""blue blue""). When a different color comes after ""bluf"" (like in ""wif""), that color is simply translated on its own (resulting in ""red"").

Therefore: bluf -> meaning: bluf repeats the color word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,100,bluf
"Observing the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" operates as a rule telling us to repeat the color denoted by the word that comes before it. Whenever ""bluf"" follows a word, the color that corresponds to the word is repeated in the output.

- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""red red"", indicating a repetition of the color red.

- If ""bluf"" follows any other word or appears at the beginning, the examples don't provide sufficient context to determine its meaning.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,100,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look closely at the patterns of the input and their corresponding output colors. Here are the patterns:

2. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
3. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
4. ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue""
5. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""

From these patterns, we can see that:

- ""walm"" always produces a repetition of the previous word's color until the next distinct word comes along (even if that word was before the ""walm"").
- After ""walm,"" the pattern is broken by the next new word, with ""dax"" being followed by green and ""lug"" by blue.
- ""zup"" and ""wif"" both appear after ""walm"" in different instances, and ""zup"" is followed by yellow while ""wif"" is followed by red consistently.

Given these observations, we could infer that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color from the word before it, until a new word appears, which will have its own color (green for ""dax,"" blue for ""lug,"" yellow for ""zup,"" and red for ""wif"") regardless of their position relative to ""walm"". 

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word to repeat until a new word appears. After ""walm,"" the next new word returns to its designated color.",0.9,100,walm
"Based on the given examples, the outputs appear to reflect a consistent pattern with respect to the nonce word ""walm."" It is reasonable to conclude that ""walm"" causes the color word that follows it (or precedes it, if there is no following color word) to be repeated three times in the output before continuing with the normal sequence of colors.

Let's analyze the given examples:

1. Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
2. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
3. Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
4. Input: dax walm lug -> Output: green green green blue
5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif -> Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

In each case, the color associated with the word immediately following walm is repeated three times. When walm is the last word before a color, there's no word to repeat, thus the repeating does not occur.

Therefore, the inferred rule for the meaning of ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: Walm causes the next color-named object (or the color-named object before it, if there are no following colors) in the sequence to repeat three times in the output.

Walm -> Rule: Repeat the following (or preceding if there is no following) color word three times.",0.8,100,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the output color to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it in the input sequence. Here is the breakdown of the input and output patterns that lead to this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and following ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" repeats twice before ""dax"" changes the color to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" repeats twice before ""dax"" changes the color to ""green,"" followed by a change to ""yellow"" by ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""zup walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" which repeats twice following ""walm"" before changing to ""green"" with ""dax"" and then to ""blue"" with ""lug.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" which repeats twice after ""walm,"" eventually changing to ""blue"" with ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, the pattern is slightly different—after ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is mentioned, followed by ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue."" ""Walm"" then makes ""blue"" repeat twice before ""zup"" and ""wif"" change the colors to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively.

"To discern the meaning of ""walm,"" let's organize the given input-output pairs and identify the rules:

1. `lug walm` -> `blue blue blue`
2. `lug dax walm` -> `blue green green green`
3. `dax walm` -> `green green green`
4. `zup wif dax walm lug` -> `yellow red green green green blue`
5. `dax walm` -> `green green green`

Here are the observations:

- The appearance of ""walm"" in each input corresponds to a pattern of repeated color words in the output.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", we see a repetition of ""blue."" Therefore, ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", we see a repetition of ""green."" Therefore, ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green.""
- The output always has one more repetition of the color word than the number of times ""walm"" appears, indicating that ""walm"" likely means ""repeat the previous color word.""
- We have additional words ""zup"" and ""wif"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, reinforcing the idea that nonce words correspond to color words.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color word one more time than the number of occurrences of ""walm.""

Example Application of Rule:
- `lug walm` has one ""lug"" before ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated (once for ""lug"" + once for ""walm"") = `blue blue blue`.
- `dax walm` has one ""dax"" before ""walm,"" so ""green"" is repeated (once for ""dax"" + once for ""walm"") = `green green green`.",1.0,101,walm
"From the given examples, the word 'walm' seems to trigger the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", where 'lug' is 'blue', and 'walm' indicates that 'blue' should be said three times.
- ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green"", where 'lug' is 'blue', 'dax' is 'green', and 'walm' only affects 'green', repeating it three times.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", where 'dax' is 'green' and 'walm' repeats it three times.
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue"", where 'zup', 'wif', 'dax', and 'lug' are 'yellow', 'red', 'green', and 'blue' respectively. 'walm' again only affects 'green', indicating that it repeats the word that precedes it three times, leaving 'blue' at the end as is.
- ""dax walm"" is again ""green green green"", consistent with the previous explanation.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word immediately before 'walm' three times.",1.0,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern in the examples:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Observing the patterns:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Now, focusing on ""walm"":

- ""lug walm"" translates to an output with three ""blue"" colors.
- ""dax walm"" translates to an output with three ""green"" colors.
- When both ""lug"" and ""dax"" are present, as in the second input, the number of ""green"" colors in the output increases by one to four, suggesting that ""walm"" interacts with the preceding word to set the color count.
- Since ""walm"" follows ""lug dax"" and ""dax,"" it seems that ""walm"" causes output of a color three times (for ""dax"") or four times (when preceded by both “lug” and ""dax"").
- Additionally, even when mixed with other colors, such as ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the number of ""green"" and ""blue"" colors corresponds to the presence of ""dax"" and ""lug.""

This could mean that ""walm"" acts as a multiplier for the color stated by the word preceding it. Specifically, it could be multiplying the color output by three. When ""lug dax"" precedes ""walm,"" this seems to increase the multiplier to four for ""dax"" and maintains a three multiplier for ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> For the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" output its corresponding color three times. If ""lug"" and ""dax"" both precede ""walm,"" output ""dax's"" corresponding color four times followed by ""lug's"" corresponding color three times.",0.9,101,walm
"Walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" appears to represent the repetition of a preceding color word. The amount of repetition is determined by the number of color words and their order that precede the word ""walm"" in the input. 

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after one or more color words (lug, dax, zup, wif representing blue, green, yellow, and red respectively), it results in the repetition of the colors that come before it in the input. Each color word preceding ""walm"" causes repetitions equal to its position in the sequence.

Examples:
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue"" one time because ""lug"" (blue) is the first color word before walm, so it's repeated once.
- ""lug dax walm"" outputs ""blue"" once followed by ""green"" twice because ""lug"" is in the first position, so ""blue"" is repeated once, and ""dax"" is in the second position, so ""green"" is repeated twice.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green"" three times because ""dax"" is the first and only color word before ""walm,"" so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red green green green blue"" because ""zup"" is first (yellow repeated once), ""wif"" is second (red repeated twice), ""dax"" is third (green repeated three times), and ""lug"" comes after ""walm,"" so it does not influence the repetition and is simply added as ""blue"" at the end.",0.8,101,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of colors that are expanded upon by the words that come before it. Here is the rule induction based on each input and output pairing:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" which suggests that ""lug"" might correspond to the color blue, and ""walm"" might represent a repetition of that color three times.

2. ""lug dax walm"" leads to ""blue green green green"" where ""lug"" is followed by ""dax"" and then ""walm."" Given that ""lug"" is blue and the sequence has one blue followed by three greens, it suggests ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" represents a repetition of the last color mentioned three times.

3. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" which supports the previous rule that ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" repeats that color three times.

4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green blue,"" which additionally suggests ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and the previously deduced color associations for ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" hold. Here, ""walm"" continues to represent a repetition of the last mentioned color thrice followed by the sequence's first color after ""walm,"" as seen by the final blue.

5. ""dax walm"" again confirms the rule, resulting in ""green green green.""

Based on the patterns, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be a repetition of the preceding color term three times. If ""walm"" is not the last word in the sequence, it seems that the pattern begins with a triple repetition of the last color before ""walm"" and ends with the color corresponding to the first word in the sequence after ""walm.""

Rule: walm indicates a repetition of the immediately preceding color word three times. If ""walm"" is followed by another color word(s), the color corresponding to the first word following ""walm"" is added to the end of the sequence.",0.8,101,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Thus we can deduce the following:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,102,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position within the sequence or the context provided by surrounding words. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each given example, regardless of the context or the other words present.",1.0,102,wif
"From the given examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The colors seem to be consistent for given words in different inputs, except for the nonce word ""zup."" Let's analyze the word ""zup"" in each example and see how it is reflected in the output:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Since ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" to red in other examples, and ""walm"" also appears to correlate with the color red (based on other examples), it seems that ""zup"" is represented by the first ""yellow"" in the output.
  
- In the second example, ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red."" We know ""wif"" is red and ""bluf"" is yellow; therefore, ""zup"" is likely the first yellow again.
  
- In the third example, ""dax wif zup"" leads to ""green red yellow."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red from previous examples, ""zup"" must represent the yellow.
  
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup"" maps to ""red yellow,"" where ""wif"" is known to be red, suggesting ""zup"" is yellow.
  
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" From this, it appears that ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" is green, with a rule likely indicating that it repeats the color for the number of times it appears in sequence. This would leave ""zup"" as the sequence of ""yellow yellow yellow.""

All evidence points toward ""zup"" representing the color yellow in the output, with the exact number of occurrences depending on the specific color repetition rule in place for other words. 

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,102,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output in each example:

1. Example: ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
2. Example: ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
3. Example: ""dax wif zup"" -> ""green red yellow""
4. Example: ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
5. Example: ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""

From these examples, we can discern the following pattern:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""wif"" also corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""zup"" must correspond to the color yellow since it's the remaining color expressed in the output that is not accounted for by the other words.

Therefore, in each case where ""zup"" appears, the output includes the color yellow. Notably, when ""zup"" is paired with ""walm,"" which translates into green, the number of times ""yellow"" is repeated in the output corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" (therefore ""green"") appears after ""zup."" This suggests that ""zup"" translates into a single instance of the color yellow when it appears before any instance of ""walm,"" as observed in the last example.

Zup -> meaning: ""yellow"" (with a repetition rule that states if ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the word ""yellow"" is repeated as many times as ""walm"" follows ""zup"" in sequence).",1.0,102,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word translates to a certain color. Each word appears to map consistently to the same color output for each instance:

- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- zup -> yellow

It is also notable that for each occurrence of ""walm"" after ""zup,"" there are multiple outputs of ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Additionally, there is a pattern of repetition for some of the words. Specifically, ""walm"" when following ""zup"" results in a repeated sequence of ""red."" However, given that in the first example ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in a single ""yellow"" rather than a sequence, we will disregard this repetition pattern in deriving the core meaning of ""zup.""

Thus, the consistent rule we can deduce from the examples is:
Rule: zup -> yellow.",0.8,102,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to a series of colors being output. To identify a pattern, we need to observe the presence of ""zup"" and the generated output colors in each example.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: dax wif zup
Output: green red yellow

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

From these inputs and outputs, we notice that when ""zup"" is present, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Specifically, ""yellow"" appears after the terms that follow ""zup"". Also, ""yellow"" repeats an amount of times equal to the number of occurrences of ""walm"" after ""zup"". 

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" in the input, and two instances of ""yellow"" appear in the output.
- In the second example, no ""walm"" follows ""zup"", so only one ""yellow"" appears.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""zup"" is followed by no other input or by ""dax"" which does not affect the number, so there is only one ""yellow"" after ""wif"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, two occurrences of ""walm"" follow ""zup"", resulting in three repetitions of ""yellow"" (since it's possible that the base rule includes one instance of ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and then an additional ""yellow"" for each ""walm"" after it).

By considering these observations, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be that it results in ""yellow"" in the output, with additional ""yellow"" for every ""walm"" that appears after it in the input.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" plus one additional ""yellow"" for every occurrence of ""walm"" that follows ""zup"" in the input sequence.",0.8,102,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to infer a pattern that dictates what the nonce word ""zup"" represents in terms of colors.

Let's observe the nonce words and outputs:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. dax wif zup -> green red yellow
4. wif zup -> red yellow
5. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow

We need to focus on what the outputs are when ""zup"" appears in different positions and contexts. From the examples, we can see:

- In outputs 1 and 2, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the colors start with double yellow irrespective of the position of ""wif"".
- In output 3, when ""zup"" is at the end and ""dax"" is at the beginning, it corresponds to a single yellow.
- In output 4, ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to a single yellow.
- In output 5, ""zup"" is in between two ""walm"" and corresponds to two yellows.

From these observations, we can infer a rule that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and the number of times yellow appears is directly related to the number of times the word following ""zup"" occurs consecutively after it. 

For instance, in example 1, ""walm"" appears once after ""zup,"" and there's one yellow. In example 5, ""walm"" appears twice in a row after ""zup,"" resulting in two yellows. However, it is not entirely clear whether the same word has to follow ""zup"" consecutively or just appear after ""zup"" regardless of position for the count of yellows to increase. But given that ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" twice, and two yellows are outputted each time, it seems likely that the consecutive rule plays a part. 

Though the rule is not explicitly clear regarding how the count of yellows is determined without seeing more varied examples, the basic translation for ""zup"" based on the given data is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow (where the number of yellows is possibly related to the count of the word that immediately follows ""zup"" in the input).",0.8,102,zup
"bluf -> the color associated with the word that precedes it.

"bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf seems to be the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, repeat the color that corresponds to the preceding word.",1.0,102,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the context in which it appears:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

From the given examples, we can observe the following:

- The outputs are sequences of colors, and each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output.

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green and appears consistently as green in the outputs.

- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow and appears consistently as yellow in the outputs.

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and appears consistently as blue in the outputs.

- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and appears consistently as red in the outputs.

- The word ""bluf"" does not have a color associated with it in the examples provided, but it appears before blue consistently when ""lug"" is present, suggesting that ""bluf"" does not alter the color sequence.

Now let's examine the positions of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), and it results in a sequence of three yellows followed by a red.

- In the second example, ""walm"" is after ""dax"" (green) and followed by ""lug"" (blue), resulting in three greens followed by a blue.

- In the third example, ""walm"" is before ""dax"" (green), and after the sequence ""bluf lug"" (blue blue), resulting in blue blue blue followed by green.

- In the fourth example, without the last ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" results in the same sequence as the third example without its last color: blue blue blue.

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is after ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), and it results in three reds.

Taking all of this into consideration, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color immediately preceding it in the sequence, for a total of three occurrences of that color.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.",1.0,102,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the output colors corresponding to each word in the given examples. Here is the observed pattern for each word:

- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to green when it is at the beginning or at the end of the sequence.
- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" consistently translates to blue, regardless of its position.
- No color is repeatedly associated with ""walm,"" indicating that its output may be context-dependent.

Now let's look at the placement of ""walm"" to better understand its context:

1. In the first input ""dax zup walm wif,"" the word ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" (which is red), and following ""walm"" are three yellows and a red.

2. In the second input ""dax walm lug,"" ""walm"" is followed by three greens and a blue (corresponding to ""lug"").

3. In the third input ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" here ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (which is blue) and is followed by a sequence containing blue and green.

4. In the fourth input ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""walm"" comes after a word corresponding to blue and is followed by one blue.

5. In the fifth input ""zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which is red) and is followed by two reds.

From these observations, we see that ""walm"" tends to replicate the color of the word that precedes it:
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" leads to yellow.
- After ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" leads to red.
- After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" leads to blue.
- In the cases where ""dax"" is the first word, it's green, but there is no immediate pattern with ""walm"" following ""dax.""

Therefore, we can induce the rule for ""walm"" seems to be replicating the color of the preceding word, with the exception of possibly interacting differently when following ""dax.""

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word (conditionally, as the context with ""dax"" is unclear).",0.9,102,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the input with the output color sequences to look for patterns.

1. In the first input ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Therefore, since ""walm"" appears between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" it seems to correspond to the repeated color ""yellow.""

2. In the second input ""dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" thus corresponds to the repeated color ""green.""

3. In the third input ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" we already know ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is not given but does not repeat, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" The color sequence after ""walm"" is ""blue blue green blue,"" which indicates that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color, ""blue.""

4. In the fourth input ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" without the presence of ""dax,"" the pattern holds as ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and once again corresponds to the repeated color ""blue.""

5. In the fifth input ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to the repeated color ""red.""

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it represents a repetition of the immediately preceding color in the sequence. Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it.",0.8,102,walm
"Observing the examples, it seems that the output color changes depending on the position of the nonce word ""walm"" and its surrounding words. Here are some deductions:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (Examples 1 and 2), the output color that follows ""walm"" is green. 
- When ""walm"" is at the end of the input (Examples 2 and 4), the color is blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs red), the output color is red (Examples 1 and 5). However, when ""walm"" is the last word, it appears to cause the word ""lug"" to be blue rather than ending in red (Examples 3 and 4).

Considering these patterns, it appears that ""walm"" may dictate or transform subsequent outputs based on its position and the preceding word. However, the exact rule for ""walm"" is not entirely clear from these examples alone, as there are inconsistencies. For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it causes the next color to be green, regardless of what the word is.

One possible rule based on the examples given is the following:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the next word's output is green. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red for both ""wif"" and ""walm."" When ""walm"" is at the end of the input, the color is blue. If ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" then regardless of its position, ""lug"" turns blue. If ""walm"" is directly after ""zup,"" it adopts the color of the previous word, which is yellow.

In simplified form:
- walm after dax -> next word is green.
- walm after wif -> walm and wif are red.
- walm at end -> walm is blue.
- walm before lug -> lug is blue.
- walm after zup -> walm is yellow.",0.7,102,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" determines the color that the immediately preceding word will output. Here is the explanation for each example:

- In example 1, ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" so ""wif"" results in the color ""yellow,"" which is a change from the usual ""red"" we observe in other examples where ""wif"" appears without ""walm"" afterward.
  
- In example 2, ""walm"" precedes the word ""lug,"" resulting in ""lug"" being colored green instead of its usual blue.
  
- In the third example, we see that ""lug"" is normally ""blue,"" but when ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" it changes ""wif"" to ""blue"" instead. In this sequence, ""lug"" also appears without ""walm"" afterward and reverts to its usual ""blue"" color.
  
- The fourth example is similar to the third one: it confirms the rule that ""walm"" changes the color of the word right before it to ""blue.""
  
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which turns ""wif,"" usually ""red,"" into ""red"" once again.

From all the examples above, one might initially think that ""walm"" changes the preceding word to ""blue"". However, the first and fifth examples challenge this by showing differing colors for ""wif"" depending on whether ""walm"" is present. 

Given the first and fifth examples being somewhat inconsistent with the straight ""turns previous word to blue"" pattern, it might indicate that ""walm"" could have an influence based on the preceding word itself or its normal output color, possibly inverting it or altering it in a specific manner. However, with the examples given, this rule doesn't hold up consistently.

A concrete rule cannot be ascertained with high confidence from these examples alone, as there is more than one instance where the term ""walm"" results in a color change that isn't limited to just blue (e.g., ""wif"" going from red to yellow, and ""lug"" going from blue to green). There's likely another pattern at play that determines what color ""walm"" will change the previous word to, but the provided examples are insufficient for defining that pattern conclusively.

Therefore, the best deduction given the contradictory examples is that ""walm"" affects the color of the preceding word, but the specific rule of how it changes the color is unclear based on the provided data. 

Rule: walm -> alters the color output of the preceding word, specific alteration rule is unclear.",0.3,102,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue' in the provided examples.",1.0,103,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,103,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. It does not appear to be context-dependent given the same input always results in the same output. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,103,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,103,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,0.8,103,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""
2. The presence of ""dax"" without any context (Example 4: Input: dax Output: green) indicates that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
3. When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the output sequence includes both colors corresponding to ""wif"" and ""dax"" (red green).
4. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence (whether it's in the middle or at the end), it always corresponds to the output ""green.""
5. Other input words like ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" correspond to their outputs blue, yellow, and yellow, respectively, without altering the output related to ""dax.""

Thus, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,103,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to the context in which ""dax"" appears.

1. wif dax -> red green
2. wif dax -> red green
3. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
4. dax -> green
5. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue

In examples 1 and 2, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and the output is consistently ""red green."" This initially suggests that ""dax"" might translate to ""green"" since ""wif"" could be ""red,"" but we need more information.

In example 3, the sequence ""wif dax"" within a longer string still results in ""red green"" which is consistent with the previous cases. However, ""dax"" appears after multiple other words, so we have to examine whether they have an influence on the meaning of ""dax.""

Example 4 provides a crucial clue: ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green,"" which confirms that the presence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output without other influences.

Finally, in example 5, ""dax"" is again accompanied by ""wif,"" and the sequence ""wif dax"" once again translates to ""red green."" ""Bluf wif lug"" translates to ""green red blue,"" which helps to confirm ""wif"" as ""red"" from previous examples, since ""lug"" is consistently ""blue.""

From the above observations, we can infer the following:

Rule:
- ""dax"" on its own or following another word translates to ""green.""
- ""dax"" does not seem to be influenced by any preceding words, except for ""wif,"" which appears to have its meaning (""red"") regardless of ""dax""'s presence.

Therefore:
dax -> green",1.0,103,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. However, we also observe other words being translated to colors: ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

So, the rule in this context appears to be a direct mapping of nonce words to specific colors. The other words don't always directly precede or follow ""dax,"" which indicates that ""dax"" does not modify the preceding or following word but stands alone as its own color.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,103,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's consider each input and its corresponding output:

- `wif dax` -> `red green`
- `wif dax` -> `red green`
- `zup walm lug zup wif dax` -> `yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green`
- `dax` -> `green`
- `lug wif dax bluf wif lug` -> `blue red green green red blue`

Analyzing the outputs in relation to the given inputs, we notice the following patterns:

1. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output sequence.
2. The word ""dax"" appears to be independent of other words when it comes to its output, since ""wif dax"" always results in ""red green"" (with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"") and ""dax"" alone translates to ""green.""

Based on the information from the examples, we can determine the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green"".",1.0,103,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.",0.8,103,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output. This relationship holds true regardless of the other words present or their associated colors. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output corresponding to the occurrence of ""wif.""",1.0,103,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". The presence of ""wif"" in every input corresponds to ""red"" in every output, regardless of what follows ""wif"". Each additional word paired with ""wif"" adds a color to the sequence, but the presence of ""wif"" itself consistently leads to the output of ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,103,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. The number of times ""red"" appears corresponds to the number of words in the input, specifically incrementing for each additional word that follows ""wif."" It is not clear what the rules are for the transformation of the other words such as ""zup"" to ""yellow"" or ""walm"" to ""red red red,"" but for ""wif"" the pattern is clear.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red,"" and the occurrence of ""red"" in the output increases according to the number of words following ""wif"" in the input.",1.0,103,wif
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the patterns in the examples provided.

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", irrespective of its position in the input or the other words around it.

- Whenever ""wif"" appears on its own, it outputs ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" it outputs ""red yellow"" consistently.
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" it outputs ""red red red"".

It's also noted that words not immediately following ""wif"" do not consistently translate to the same color. For instance, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" but ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""wif,"" indicating ""wif"" might only affect the word directly following it.

However, there's not enough information to deduce if or how ""wif"" affects other words, as we only see ""zup"" and ""walm"" following ""wif"" and no other contextual words preceding ""wif."" Thus, it's difficult to formulate a rule about how ""wif"" might affect the words that follow it beyond the examples given.

From the information we have, the rule we can infer is:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string. The words after ""wif"" are translated to different colors depending on the specific word, but ""wif"" itself remains constant as ""red"".",1.0,103,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."" When ""wif"" is followed by another word, additional words in colors are produced corresponding to each syllable or segment in the following word. However, ""wif"" alone produces only ""red.""

Here are the deductions that lead to this understanding:

- ""wif zup"" outputs ""red yellow,"" suggesting that ""wif"" represents ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" which suggests each syllable in ""walm"" produces a ""red."" With the presumption that ""walm"" might consist of three components according to this logic.
- ""wif"" alone results in ""red,"" reinforcing that ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" outputs ""green green red yellow,"" which, as per the sequence keeps the ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"" consistent; ""dax"" and ""bluf"" must therefore correspond to ""green green,"" respectively.
- Finally, ""wif zup"" being repeated with the output ""red yellow"" is consistent with the initial occurrence, confirming the association.

Given this information, the rule for wif is:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"". When ""wif"" precedes another word, it outputs ""red"" followed by colors representing the syllables or parts of the following word, with ""zup"" specifically translating to ""yellow."" When ""wif"" is standalone, it simply outputs ""red.""",1.0,103,wif
"From the examples given, it seems that the word ""zup"" always translates to the word ""yellow."" Furthermore, it seems that each other word provided in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Let's examine the repeated words and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
2. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
3. ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green."" It's important to note that ""dax"" and ""walm"" appear to share the same color output.
4. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Given this pattern, the rule for ""zup"" based on the available data is that ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,103,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples, it appears that ""zup"" correlates directly to the word ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output as a direct translation, irrespective of the position of ""zup"" within the sequence.",1.0,103,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the examples you provided corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, we can inductively conclude that the nonce word ""zup"" is used to represent the color ""yellow.""",1.0,103,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern: 

- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" in the output. 
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" in the output. 
- ""walm"" consistently maps to ""green"" in the output, no matter its position relative to ""dax"". 
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" in the output.

The word ""zup"" occurs at the end of each input sequence, and in each case, the word ""yellow"" occurs at the end of the output sequence. This consistency suggests a direct mapping from ""zup"" to ""yellow"", regardless of the other words' positions. It is not context-dependent and does not change based on the other words present in the input. Therefore, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,103,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look at each instance where it appears and identify any patterns or consistent results in the outputs:

1. lug zup -> blue yellow
2. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
3. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
5. zup lug -> yellow blue

Here are some observations based on the given examples:

- The word ""zup"" always results in the color ""yellow"" appearing at the end of the output, right before ""blue"" if ""lug"" is present.
- ""Zup"" does not produce output when it appears in the middle or at the beginning of a sequence.
- ""Zup"" could indicate the end of a color sequence or trigger yellow in the output.

Considering these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" signals the addition of the color ""yellow"" at that specific point in the sequence. If ""lug"" follows ""zup,"" it then adds ""blue"" following ""yellow."" If ""lug"" precedes ""zup,"" it contributes ""blue"" before ""yellow.""

So: zup -> triggers the color yellow at its position in the sequence.",0.9,103,zup
"Considering the provided examples, we can see that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Let's identify the color associated with each word, including ""bluf"":

1. wif -> red
2. dax -> green
3. lug -> blue
4. zup -> yellow
5. walm -> not explicitly shown, but we can deduce it later.

Now, we need to deduce the color represented by ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which results in ""red green"". We already know that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" must correspond to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is the last word and the output ends with ""yellow"". However, the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which we know translates to ""yellow"". Therefore, we cannot confirm that ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green"". Since ""dax"" is ""green"", this suggests ""bluf"" might also be ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is at the end, preceded by two instances of ""lug"", which is ""blue"". The output ends with ""blue blue"", which might imply ""bluf"" is also ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output is ""yellow blue"". Again, since we know ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""bluf"" could be ""yellow"" in this context.

Given the potentially conflicting evidence, it is necessary to find a pattern that reflects the context of the word ""bluf"" in order to determine its color consistently across all examples. By analyzing all examples, we notice that ""bluf"" always results in the color of the word that follows it (if it's not the last word) or the one that precedes it:

- In the first and third examples, ""dax"" (green) is after ""bluf"", and the output is ""green"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is the last word, and the word before it is ""zup"" (yellow), and the output is ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is the last word, preceded by ""lug"" (blue), and the output is ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" (blue) is after ""bluf"", and the output is ""blue"".

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately following it. If there is no word after ""bluf"", it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning is that ""bluf"" represents a chameleon-like behavior, taking on the property (in this case, color) of the adjacent word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the adjacent word",1.0,103,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> green when following dax; blue when following lug; yellow when following zup; otherwise, red.",1.0,103,bluf
"To induce a rule for the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each input where ""bluf"" appears:

1. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
2. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
3. Input: dax bluf lug wif -> Output: green green blue red
4. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
5. Input: zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue

By analyzing the outputs, we can observe the following patterns:

- In cases 1 and 3, ""bluf"" follows a word, and the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the output for the word immediately preceding it: ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""red""; ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" following it also translates to ""green.""

- Case 2 differs as ""bluf"" is the last word, and it repeats the color of the word just before it (""zup"" -> ""yellow"").

- Case 4 is a longer string with multiple instances of ""lug."" The last word ""bluf"" repeats the output color of the word before it (""lug"" -> ""blue"").

- In case 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is translated as ""yellow"" as well.

Putting these observations together, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the output color for the word immediately before it.",1.0,103,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green when preceded by the word ""dax,"" and yellow when preceded by the word ""zup"". However, it corresponds to blue when following the word ""lug"", and when it is the last word in the sequence, it seems to take the color of the prior color in the sequence. 

Using this information, we can induce a rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes or follows it. If ""dax"" precedes it, ""bluf"" means green. If ""zup"" precedes it, then ""bluf"" is yellow. If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it is blue. If ""bluf"" is the last word, it repeats the color of the word immediately before it unless that word is ""lug"" or ""zup"". 

Therefore, ""bluf"" does not have a consistent meaning; its meaning changes based on specific rules related to the surrounding words.",0.8,103,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".",0.0,103,bluf
"Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: zup wif walm

   Output: green green green

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

It appears that the word ""walm"" causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated three times. We can deduce this as follows:

- Every occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by three repetitions of a color in the output.
- The color that is repeated corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"".
   - In examples 1 and 3, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" three times.
   - In example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" three times.
- In example 4, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""zup"" and ""wif""; the sequence of colors ""blue blue blue"" corresponds to ""lug walm"", and the colors for ""zup"" and ""wif"" follow it in the output.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used after another word, the output is that preceding word's color repeated three times.

Similarly, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" so ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,103,walm
"walm -> repeating the color associated with the preceding word three times. Rule: When the word 'walm' follows another word, the color associated with the previous word is repeated three times.",1.0,103,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color assigned to the word immediately preceding it three times. Here's how it breaks down:

- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- The ""dax walm"" example is repeated, confirming the consistency of the ""green green green"" result.
- In ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which supports the rule.
- Finally, in ""lug walm,"" we again see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

From the examples, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be:

- Other words must have consistent meanings since the pattern in color output is accordingly consistent across different examples.
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
- ""walm,"" when it occurs once with ""zup"" and ""lug,"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (second input/output pair), but when with ""wif"" and ""lug"" it corresponds to ""red"" (first input/output pair).

"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word

Explanation: In each example, the color associated with the word ""bluf"" matches the color of the word immediately preceding it.

- In the first input, ""wif"" translates to red, and the output for ""bluf"" is also red.
- In the second input, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" is also green following it.
- In the third input, ""zup"" is yellow, and again ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In the fourth input, the output for ""bluf"" is red, which is the color of the preceding word ""wif"".
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which is colored blue, and thus ""bluf"" is also blue.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,104,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the following word. If there is no following word, repeat the color of the previous word.

In every example provided, when the word ""bluf"" is followed by another word, the color outputted by ""bluf"" is the same as the color given for the following word. In case ""bluf"" is positioned at the end with no word following it, it repeats the color of the word preceding it.

Here's the breakdown of the examples to illustrate the rule more clearly:

- In ""wif bluf dax"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", which outputs ""green"". Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""green"".
- In ""dax bluf wif lug"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", which outputs ""red"". Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf"", ""bluf"" is followed by no word, but precedes ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"". Thus, ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"".
- In ""dax zup wif bluf lug"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", which outputs ""blue"". Thus, ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"".
- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", which outputs ""red"". Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""red"".

This pattern holds for all the given examples, allowing us to deduce the rule as stated.",1.0,104,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it. Therefore, when ""bluf"" occurs after a word, the output color is the same as the color associated with the preceding word. 

Examples:
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,104,bluf
"From the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" duplicates the color used for the word that immediately follows it. In other words, the color assigned to the word after ""bluf"" is used twice—once for ""bluf"" and once for the following word itself. Let's examine each example:

- wif bluf dax -> red red green (Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"" which is green.)
- dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue (Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"" which is red.)
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.)
- dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue (Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"" which is blue.)
- lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue (Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"" which is red.)

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it mirrors the color assigned to the immediately subsequent word.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the next word.",1.0,104,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to relate to the color associated with the word that directly follows ""bluf."" Each time ""bluf"" is followed by a specific word, the output color directly after ""red"" (which corresponds to ""bluf"") is consistently the same, suggesting that ""bluf"" functions to duplicate the color associated with the following word. 

For example:
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and following ""bluf,"" the color red is followed immediately by green.
- In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""wif"" after ""bluf"" leads to the color red again after the red for ""bluf.""
- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" ""wif"" again follows ""bluf"" and results in the color red after the red for ""bluf.""

Given this consistent pattern, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: The output for ""bluf"" is always ""red,"" followed by the color associated with the word that comes immediately after ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""

Thus:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is: bluf outputs ""red"" followed by the color associated with the next word in the sequence.",1.0,104,bluf
"Based on the examples provided and analyzing the pattern of colors, walm seems to be translated as a color that matches the color word that immediately precedes it. The rule can be derived by observing that every time walm occurs, it takes on the color value of the preceding color word.

Here is the justification:

1. (lug walm dax) -> (blue blue green): walm follows lug, which is blue, so walm is also blue.
2. (wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug) -> (red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue): walm follows lug, which is blue, thus walm is also blue.
3. (lug dax zup dax walm wif) -> (blue green yellow green green green red): walm follows dax, which is green, hence walm is also green.
4. (lug wif dax walm zup) -> (blue red green green green yellow): walm follows dax, which is green, so walm is green again.
5. (wif zup lug dax zup walm) -> (red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow): walm follows zup, which is yellow, therefore walm is yellow.

Rule: walm -> the color that is the same as the color word immediately before it.",1.0,104,walm
"By analyzing the input and output pairs in the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""walm."" To do this, let's look at the corresponding colors for each nonce word and identify the pattern.

In every instance, ""walm"" results in a repeated color from immediately prior in the sequence. Here are the examples laid out:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""walm"" corresponds to a repeat of ""blue,"" which is the color of the word before ""walm"" (lug).

2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""walm"" corresponds to a repeat of ""green,"" which is the color of the word before ""walm"" (dax).

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""walm"" corresponds to a repeat of ""blue,"" which is the color of the word before ""walm"" (lug).

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""walm"" corresponds to a repeat of ""green,"" which is the color of the word before ""walm"" (dax).

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" corresponds to a repeat of ""yellow,"" which is the color of the word before ""walm"" (zup).

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next assigned color to be a repeat of the color assigned to the word immediately prior to ""walm.""

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" is to induce a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,104,walm
"The word ""walm"" seems to be a function that applies to the word that immediately follows it. When ""walm"" is followed by a color word (or a word that represents a color), it outputs that color until another color word appears or until the sequence ends.

To determine the exact rule, we should look at the words before and after ""walm"" to see how it affects the corresponding colors in the output:

1. ""lug walm dax lug"" yields ""blue blue blue green blue"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". After ""walm"", ""dax"" still corresponds to ""blue"" instead of its usual ""green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" changes the following sequence to maintain the color of the word immediately before it.

2. ""dax walm wif"" generates ""green green green red"", where ""dax"" normally corresponds to ""green"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and ""wif"" which usually corresponds to ""red"" turns to ""green"" in the output until the color changes.

3. ""walm dax lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue"". In this case, we can see that ""walm"" is making the following ""dax"" to be ""blue,"" taking the color from the previous ""lug"".

4. ""wif dax walm zup"" results in ""red green green green yellow"". The presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" ensures that ""zup"" which normally is ""yellow"" comes out as ""green"" again. It's not turning ""wif"" into ""green"" since there's ""dax"" in between.

5. ""lug dax zup walm"" outputs ""blue green yellow yellow yellow"". So here, ""walm"" keeps the color of ""zup"" as ""yellow"" until the end.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the usual color of the subsequent words to match the color of the word just before ""walm"", and this continues until a new color word ""resets"" the sequence or the sequence ends.

So, walm -> meaning. Meaning: Walm is a rule that makes the subsequent words maintain the same color as the word immediately before walm, until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.",0.9,104,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to correspond to the color that immediately follows it. To derive this rule, we can look at the sequences where ""walm"" is followed by another word and the associated colors in the output:

- In the first example, ""walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue green blue."" The word ""walm"" comes before two instances of the color blue.
- In the second example, ""walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green red."" Here, the word ""walm"" is followed by the color green.
- In the third example, ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green."" The word ""walm"" is followed by the color blue.
- In the fourth example, ""walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" precedes the color green.
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""walm"" comes before the color yellow.

In every case, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the same color. It looks like ""walm"" results in the next color being repeated or extending the current color streak if possible (as seen in the third example). 

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next color word to be repeated in the output or continues the current streak of color.

Note: Since the color directly after ""walm"" is always repeated at least once in the output, ""walm"" could be interpreted as a command to repeat the following color word. However, since ""lug walm dax"" does not introduce a new color after ""walm"" but continues with blue (""blue blue blue green""), it seems more likely that ""walm"" is extending the color streak if followed by the same color word that precedes it. If the color word following ""walm"" were different, the rule might dictate that this new color starts a repeated sequence. However, there isn't an example that directly shows this case.",0.8,104,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each input and its corresponding output, looking for patterns:

Input 1: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output 1: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Input 2: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output 2: blue green yellow green green green red

Input 3: lug walm dax
Output 3: blue blue blue green

Input 4: lug wif dax walm zup
Output 4: blue red green green green yellow

Input 5: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output 5: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Rule:

Looking at inputs and outputs, when the word ""walm"" appears, the following pattern can be observed in the outputs:

- The color before ""walm"" is repeated one more time after ""walm"" before it moves onto the next color (if there is any change). For example:
In Input 1, the color before ""walm"" is blue and after ""walm"" it is again blue before changing to green.
In Input 2, the color before ""walm"" is green and after ""walm"" it remains green before changing to red.
In Input 3, ""walm"" is followed by green, suggesting the previous color was blue, and it continues being blue after ""walm.""
In Input 4, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of greens, indicating repetition of the prior color.
In Input 5, ""walm"" is followed by a yellow, suggesting a continuation of the previous color sequence before ""walm.""

It's worth mentioning that there could be alternative interpretations or rules that fit these examples, but based on the given data, the repetition rule seems to be consistent.

Therefore, based on the provided data:

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,105,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems to be the following:

Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red."" The word ""wif"" itself does not seem to influence the color associated with other words; instead, each word is associated with its own color independent of ""wif.""

Here's the breakdown by example:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is not repeated, so we cannot determine its color; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to three ""greens"" when it appears twice, indicating repetition might increase the count of associated colors; ""wif"" corresponds to two repetitions of ""red.""
3. ""walm"" is associated with ""green,"" and with ""wif"" preceding it, the count of ""red"" is three, matching the count for ""green"" corresponding to ""walm.""
4. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" with no duplication-related increase in count.
5. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" regardless of context is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,105,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be related to the color it outputs when it appears in the input. When ""wif"" appears, the output is red. Meanwhile, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""dax"" corresponds to green. However, ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it causes a repetition of red in the output.

Here's a breakdown:

- ""zup"" appears to translate to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green.""
- ""wif"" appears to translate to ""red.""
- ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it in the sequence.

Therefore:

wif -> red",1.0,105,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red."" However, there's an additional pattern, in that ""wif"" doesn't just correspond to the color ""red"" once but repeats it a number of times based on some aspect of the previous word(s). 

Here's the pattern we observe:

1. Input: zup bluf wif
   - The word ""wif"" follows ""bluf"", and the output is ""yellow yellow red"". 
   
2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   - Here ""wif"" follows ""walm"", and the output after ""wif"" is ""red red red"". Notice that ""walm"" triggers three ""red"" in the output.

3. Input: wif walm
   - When ""wif"" is first, followed by ""walm"", it still results in three ""red"" in the output.

4. Input: zup wif zup dax
   - Following a ""zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"".

5. Input: zup wif
   - ""Wif"" follows ""zup"" and there is a single ""red"" in the output.

The pattern seems to be that ""wif"" triggers a number of ""red"" repetitions in the output equal to the repetitions of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which appears once before ""wif,"" so ""wif"" leads to ""red"" once.
2. ""walm"" does not have a clear color associated with it in the examples without ""wif,"" but since it immediately precedes ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red"", it might mean that ""walm"" prompts three repetitions of any following color, including ""red"" from ""wif.""

Therefore, the inferred rule is that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" with the number of repetitions equal to the number of times the preceding color is mentioned. If there is no preceding color, as in example 3, it seems to default to three repetitions of ""red."" However, there is not enough information to determine why the default is three repetitions.

Rule: wif -> ""red"" (repeated according to the number of times the preceding color appears; default to three repetitions if it starts the sequence or if the preceding word does not correspond to a clear single color).",0.9,105,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. Every time ""dax"" occurs, the output is ""green.""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
4. ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the output ""green"" as in second and ""red"" as in first input.
5. ""walm"" results in ""green"" when combined with ""dax"" but ""blue"" otherwise.

The difficult part is determining the meaning of ""zup."" Let's try to see a pattern:

- In the first input, ""zup"" occurs after ""lug"" and before ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the second input, ""zup"" is between ""wif"" and ""wif,"" with ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the third input, ""zup"" is the first word, and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth input, ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow."" 
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output is ""green yellow.""

From these observations, irrespective of its position or the words around it, ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow."" 

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,105,zup
"Analyzing the given examples, let's identify if there's any pattern that links the input to the output by focusing on the occurrences of the word ""zup"" and its corresponding output.

In each instance:

1. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""
   The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   
2. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red""

   Once more, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   
5. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""

From these examples, it'd seem that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" without dependence on its position in the sentence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup means yellow.",1.0,105,zup
"Based on the examples given:

1. When it is between ""lug"" and ""wif"" as in ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

3. When it is the first word as in ""zup lug walm,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
4. When it is surrounded by ""walm"" and ""lug"" as in ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
5. When it follows ""dax"" as in ""dax zup,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. dax bluf wif zup wif  -> green green red yellow red
3. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
4. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" aligns to ""red red green green green,"" suggesting ""bluf"" could mean ""red.""
2. ""lug bluf"" aligns to ""blue blue,"" which could imply that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" since ""lug"" itself translates to ""blue.""
3. ""zup wif bluf"" aligns to ""yellow red red,"" so if ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""bluf"" in this context also translates to ""red.""
4. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" aligns to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" Considering the meanings of ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax,"" it appears that ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" here since it's between two instances of ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow.""
5. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" aligns to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" In this, ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" when following ""lug"" and ""yellow"" when preceding ""wif.""

From this analysis, it seems that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed meaning but instead takes on the color of the word that immediately follows or precedes it. 

Based on the provided examples, which are inconsistent with one another but contextually coherent within each sequence, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word it immediately follows or precedes.

Hence, the rule can be represented like this:

bluf -> Takes the color of the next or previous word's meaning depending on the context.",0.8,105,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" means ""red."" 

Evidence:
- In the first input, the presence of ""bluf"" yields ""red red"" in the output.
- In the second input, the output for ""lug bluf"" is ""blue blue,"" but since ""lug"" is a new word preceding ""bluf,"" it appears ""lug"" could correspond to ""blue,"" leaving ""bluf"" to mean ""red.""
- In the third input, ""zup wif bluf"" gives the output ""yellow red red,"" which supports the notion since ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- The fourth and fifth examples continue to support the rule that ""bluf"" correlates with ""red,"" regardless of its position amongst the other words.

bluf -> red",0.8,105,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

The examples indicate that whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"". 

- In the first input, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax walm"", and the corresponding output has ""red"" following the color that ""wif"" represents (red) and before the sequence of colors that ""dax walm"" represents (green green green).
- In the second input, ""bluf"" stands alone with ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue"", indicating ""lug"" represents blue and ""bluf"", again, is red. However, since the output does not include red, the rule may not be simply ""bluf → red"". 
- In the third input, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and there is no word after ""bluf"", and the corresponding output has ""red"" following the color that ""wif"" represents (red).
- In the fourth and fifth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""wif"", with corresponding outputs mirroring the placement of ""red"".

Given this evidence, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"", but it's important to note there could be more complicated rules at play that are not evidenced in the limited examples provided.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the output being repeated thrice with the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's how we deduce the rule:

- Input: zup walm => Output: yellow yellow yellow
  (The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and after the word ""walm"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.)

- Input: dax walm => Output: green green green
  (The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" and after the word ""walm"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.)

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm => Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
  (The word ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and after the word ""walm"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.)

Therefore, the rule is that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that comes immediately before it to repeat three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,105,walm
"Observing the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" dictates the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Each time ""walm"" is used, the color word before it is repeated three times in the output. Here are the rules I have deduced:

- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the previously mentioned color, i.e., ""red red"" when following ""wif,"" and ""yellow yellow"" when following ""zup.""

Now, for each of the ""walm"" instances:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""

"Based on the examples given, we can establish a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

- Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red"".
- The position of ""wif"" in the input doesn't change the output color associated with it.
  
Additionally, the other words in the examples seem to correspond with their own consistent output color:

- ""bluf"" corresponds with ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" and with ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"". There's not enough data about ""bluf"" in other contexts to determine a pattern for it alone.
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"".
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"".
- ""walm"" corresponds with ""blue"".

Given these observations, we can determine that ""wif"" correlates to ""red"" regardless of its context, while the meanings of the other words might change based on what precedes them.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,106,wif
"Based on the sequences provided, let's analyze the outputs in relation to the presence of the nonce word ""wif"":

1. When ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
2. ""wif"" by itself does not determine the other colors in the sequence.
3. ""wif"" seems invariant, always resulting in ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the input.

Looking at the examples:
- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" once in the output. ""Bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is before and after ""lug,"" and both ""wif"" occurrences correspond to ""red"" in the output. ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is at the end and again corresponds to ""red."" ""Dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears three times and each time corresponds to ""red"" in the output. The rest of the words correspond to the color they previously matched with (e.g., ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue""). ""Walm"" is new, but by deduction, it must be ""blue"" because each time it appears, it corresponds with ""blue"" in the output.

Hence, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input maps to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,106,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif.""

Let's look at each instance where ""wif"" is used and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: wif lug wif -> Output: red blue red
3. Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red
4. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

From these examples, it looks like every time the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is in the corresponding output in the same position as ""wif"". There is no instance where ""wif"" corresponds to another color. Thus, we can deduce that:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,106,wif
"Observing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, a pattern can be discerned that indicates what the nonce word ""wif"" might mean in this context. Here are the patterns observed:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is always in the corresponding position in the output.

2. Other words also have consistent outputs:
   - ""bluf"" leads to the output ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" and ""red"" otherwise.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when followed by another word besides ""wif"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Given the fact that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"" and does not seem to depend on context (unlike ""bluf"" which changes based on preceding words), the rule for ""wif"" can be determined as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"" regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Therefore:

wif -> red",1.0,106,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" independent of the context in which it is used. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,106,wif
"In each example, ""zup"" consistently produces the output ""yellow"". However, it also appears to transform the other non-zup words into colors as follows:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green when following dax, but following zup it gives yellow
- lug -> blue only when following zup

The transformation could be context-dependent for some words (like ""bluf""), but in each case, ""zup"" alone yields ""yellow."" The color output sequence corresponds to the position of the input words relative to ""zup"".

So the rule appears to be that ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and it triggers translation of adjacent words into specific colors based on their position and what they are combined with.

Rule: 
zup -> ""yellow"" (zup translates to the color yellow, and influences the translation of nearby words into colors based on their order and combination.)",1.0,106,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. When other nonce words precede ""zup,"" their translations appear before the word ""yellow"" in the output. For instance, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when used with ""zup"" but translates to ""yellow"" on its own. ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow,"" and when used with other nonce words, each nonce word has its own color translation which appears in the same order before the word ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,106,zup
"Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and is followed by another color word corresponding to the word before ""zup"". If there is no word before ""zup"", then only ""yellow"" is the output.

- wif zup -> red yellow (because ""wif"" comes before ""zup"" and corresponds to ""red"")
- dax zup -> green yellow (because ""dax"" comes before ""zup"" and corresponds to ""green"")
- dax bluf zup -> green green yellow (because ""bluf"" comes before ""zup"" and corresponds to ""green""; ""dax"" also appears and corresponds to ""green"")
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (because ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow"")
- zup lug dax -> yellow blue green (because ""lug"" comes after ""zup"" and corresponds to ""blue""; ""dax"" comes last and corresponds to ""green"")",1.0,106,zup
"From the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In each case, regardless of the other words present, the output always includes the color yellow whenever the word ""zup"" is included in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,106,zup
"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" appears to translate to the word ""yellow."" However, it's important to note that zup appears to produce an output that reflects a sequence of colors corresponding to the words preceding it, and ending with ""yellow.""

In every instance, the final color in the output sequence is ""yellow,"" and this is consistent even when the word ""zup"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence. Furthermore, the input words before ""zup"" influence the colors that precede ""yellow"" in the output.

For example, the input ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow,"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red."" The input ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow,"" with ""dax"" translating to ""green."" When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" as in ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow."" In the case of ""dax bluf zup,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""bluf"" to ""green"" again, resulting in ""green green yellow.""

Finally, in ""zup lug dax,"" the output is ""yellow blue green,"" suggesting that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" once again to ""green,"" with ""zup"" starting the sequence with ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it adds ""yellow"" to the output sequence and the other words correspond to specific colors that precede this ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow (with the preceding input words determining the sequence of colors before ""yellow"" in the output).",1.0,106,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we have the following correlations:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""

Since ""bluf"" consistently results in two color outputs and always the same color (red in this case), we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> red red

Meaning that ""bluf"" is translated into the color ""red"" repeated twice.",1.0,106,bluf
bluf -> red,1.0,106,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking at the consistent output whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input.

- In every instance of ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- The presence of other words affects the output (e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"").
- Regardless of the other words in the string, ""bluf"" always produces ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""red.""",1.0,106,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

1. zup corresponds to yellow,
2. lug corresponds to blue,
3. dax corresponds to green,
4. wif corresponds to red,
5. bluf corresponds to repeating the color of the word immediately preceding it.

So the rule for the meaning of bluf is:

bluf -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.

Examples:
- In ""wif bluf"", wif corresponds to red, and bluf repeats that color, resulting in ""red red"".
- In ""dax zup bluf"", zup corresponds to yellow, and bluf repeats that color, resulting in ""green yellow yellow"".
- In ""wif bluf dax lug"", wif corresponds to red, and bluf repeats that color, then dax is green and lug is blue, resulting in ""red red green blue"". 

So the rule is:
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,106,bluf
"After examining the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a sequence of colors that are derived from the words preceding it. Each of the examples involves a sequence of words followed by ""bluf,"" and the output reflects a sequence of colors where ""bluf"" generates a specific sequence of colors. The sequence of colors created by ""bluf"" is influenced by the preceding word, as follows:

- After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow""
- After ""wif,"" ""bluf"" produces ""red red""
- After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" produces ""green""
- After ""lug,"" there is no example, so we cannot determine the result.

By following the pattern, we can deduce the corresponding color changes for ""bluf"" based on the word variation before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" causes a repetition of the last color mentioned:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" after ""wif"" results in ""red red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" after ""dax"" results in just ""green"" (which may indicate only a single repetition is needed).
- There is not enough information to determine the rule when ""bluf"" is preceded by other words (like ""lug"").",0.9,106,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by looking for patterns corresponding to its occurrences. Here is the analysis:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""blue"" appears in the output.
2. The sequence of ""blue"" seems to be of a length corresponding to the position of ""walm"". For example:
   - In the first example, ""walm"" is the second word and there are two ""green"" before it, so it's followed by two ""blue"".
   - In the third example, ""walm"" is the fourth word and followed by four ""blue"" in sequence.

Given this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Indicates a sequence of ""blue"" in the output equal in number to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence counting from the first ""walm"". If there are multiple instances of ""walm"", the count resets with each occurrence.",0.9,106,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example. We'll examine which parts of the input correspond to which parts of the output:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup -> Output: green green green red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the final two ""blue""

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
Noticing a pattern for ""wif"" and ""zup"", it's evident ""walm"" takes on the last color mentioned before it, but since it is ""walm zup walm wif"", ""walm"" must repeat the color:

4. Input: lug walm zup -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the second and third ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

In this case, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with ""lug"".

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the three ""yellow"" following the second ""zup""

Given these analyses, it seems that ""walm"" refers to the repetition of the color value of the preceding word (the color associated with the preceding word in the output string). However, because of the third input where ""walm"" follows a ""zup"" and ""wif"" follows the second ""walm,"" which in turn produces three repetitions of ""yellow"" followed by ""red,"" it may also have an additional rule of outputting the color value of the subsequent word if it immediately follows ""walm"". This is a contradicting situation as the first rule that we have established should make the output red, not yellow.

However, since there is only one instance of this contradiction, and additional data may be required to establish this as a rule, we will proceed with the first rule as the working rule with a note of potential exception as per the third example:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated in the output. (Note: may also influence the output based on the following word based on the third example, but further examples would be needed to confirm this.)",0.8,106,walm
"Reviewing the examples provided, we can analyze and induce the rule for what ""walm"" might signify by identifying patterns in the Input and their corresponding Output:

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

By examining the usage of ""walm"" and the output colors, it seems that whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, multiple instances of the color immediately preceding ""walm"" repeat in the output before moving to the next color in the sequence. For instance:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, and the output shows three greens.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and in the output, there are three blues.
- In the last example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and we see three yellows in a row in the output.

It is possible that ""walm"" serves as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times before continuing with the sequence.

Thus, the rule appears to be:
Walm -> Repeat the color represented by the preceding word three times.",0.8,106,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided.

Example 1:
Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
Here, ""walm"" is used after ""dax"" and the resulting color is ""green."" The sequence ends with ""wif zup"" resulting in ""red yellow.""

Example 2:
Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the result is ""blue.""

Example 3:
Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
In this example, ""walm"" appears twice. The first time after ""lug"" with the result being ""blue"" again. The second time after ""zup"" with the result being ""yellow,"" and finally it is followed by ""wif"" which results in ""red.""

Example 4:
Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue,"" then it precedes ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

Example 5:
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" follows the sequence ""dax zup"" resulting in ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, we can notice the following patterns:
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color is blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color is yellow.
- ""walm"" does not precede ""wif"" in the examples, so we don't have a pattern for that.
- ""walm"" does not directly follow ""dax"" except in the first example where ""walm wif"" resulted in ""green red,"" making it unclear if ""walm"" or ""wif"" contributed to the ""green.""

With these patterns in mind, it seems that ""walm"" could represent a rule that carries over the color of the previous word but modifies it in some situations.

From the examples available, we can induce the following tentative rule:

Rule: ""walm"" carries the color of the previous word unless it follows ""zup,"" in which case it changes the color to yellow.

Therefore, we can write:
walm -> meaning: Carries the previous word's color, but changes it to yellow if following ""zup.""",0.8,106,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern in each given example:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Now, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   In this sequence, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" the first time and ""yellow"" the second time.

4. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   Again, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Considering these examples, the pattern seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

- When ""lug"" is the sole input, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is combined with ""bluf,"" which translates to ""blue,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" also means ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is alongside ""dax,"" which results in ""green,"" the distinct output for ""lug"" remains ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is surrounded by ""zup bluf"" and ""zup,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the word ""lug"" is still translated as ""blue.""

"Based on the inputs and the corresponding outputs, it seems like each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Repeated input words yield repeated colors in the output, such as ""dax"" always corresponding to green and ""lug"" always corresponding to blue.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

"Reviewing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it looks like the nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently associated with the color red. In every instance of the word ""bluf"" being used, the output includes the color red. No other word in the examples provided results in the color red being part of the output.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,107,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the input-to-output mapping given in the examples. Looking at the outputs, we see that they consist of color words: green, red, blue, and yellow. Each input word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output.

Here are the observations based on the given examples:

- Every occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" does not depend on its position in the sentence for the output color.

With this information, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red.",1.0,107,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf consistently results in the color red, except for one instance where it yields a different color (blue). Since every other word consistently maps to a single color, the discrepancy with bluf likely indicates a context-dependent rule rather than a straightforward one-to-one mapping.

Examining the context, it seems that bluf results in the color red when preceded by different words (dax, wif, zup) and when followed by different words (wif, lug, walm). However, in the single instance where bluf is followed by another occurrence of the same word (lug), the output color for bluf changes to blue.

This suggests that bluf maps to red when it is either before or after a word that does not repeat immediately. When bluf is immediately followed by a repeated word, its color changes to the color corresponding to that word.

Rule: bluf -> red, except when immediately followed by a repeated word, in which case bluf yields the color of the repeated word.",0.8,107,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will correlate each occurrence of the word with its output across the examples. By examining the input and output pairs, the pattern for ""bluf"" becomes apparent:

1. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   - ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red""

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red""

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red""

4. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow""

5. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red""

Based on these examples, we see that in four out of five times ""bluf"" occurs, it corresponds with ""red."" However, in the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow."" Thus, it's evident that there is a conditional rule in play related to the context of ""bluf"" within the sequence.

With the given data, we can hypothesize a rule such that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" except when preceded by ""zup zup,"" in which case it corresponds to ""yellow."" This is based on the anomaly in example four, where the pattern ""zup zup"" occurs before ""bluf."" However, we'd need additional examples to confirm this rule or establish a more complicated pattern if other conditions yield different colors.

Rule: bluf -> red (except when preceded by ""zup zup,"" then it corresponds to yellow).",0.8,107,bluf
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Rule: If a color is mentioned directly before ""walm,"" then the output is a repetition of the associated color with ""walm"" as many times as the number of syllables in the preceding color word. For instance, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and has one syllable, so ""walm"" repeats the word ""blue"" three times. Similarly, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, reflecting the single syllable in ""dax.""",1.0,107,walm
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Here's the observed pattern:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated (""red red green green green"").
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated (""blue blue blue"").
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated (""yellow yellow yellow"").
- When ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green) both precede ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated, since ""dax"" comes last before ""walm"" (""blue green green green"").
- When only ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated (""green green green"").

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color of the word immediately before it to repeat in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it in the output.",1.0,107,walm
"walm -> repetitive color based on the previous word. Rule:

- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup"", respectively, each time resulting in three repetitions of their associated colors ""blue"" and ""yellow"".
- The fourth example again shows ""dax"" before ""walm"" yielding three ""green"" outputs in a row.
- The last example, where “walm” follows directly after ""dax"", leads to three ""green"" outputs.

"walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, walm seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. For instance:

- In the first example ""wif bluf dax walm,"" wif corresponds to 'red', bluf corresponds to 'red', and dax corresponds to 'green'. The output has the color 'green' repeated three times after 'dax', indicating that walm is causing the color associated with 'dax' to be repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm,"" lug corresponds to 'blue' and is followed by 'blue' repeated three times.
- In ""zup walm,"" zup corresponds to 'yellow' and is followed by 'yellow' repeated three times.
- In ""lug dax walm,"" lug corresponds to 'blue', and dax corresponds to 'green' which is then repeated three times, seemingly replacing 'blue'.
- In ""dax walm,"" dax corresponds to 'green', which is then repeated three times.

Rule: Walm repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times.",1.0,107,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe a pattern where ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that precedes it. The number of color repetitions seems to be consistent with the number of syllables or segments in the word that directly precedes ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green."" ""Dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green."" Since ""dax"" has one syllable, ""walm"" leads to it being said three times in total.
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue."" ""Lug"" has one syllable, and ""walm"" translates to three total occurrences of ""blue.""
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow."" Given ""zup"" has one syllable, ""walm"" yields three ""yellow"" in sequence.
- ""lug dax walm"" outputs ""blue green green green."" Here, ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" so ""green"" is repeated three times after ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" Again, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and thus three ""green"" are generated.

In the second example:
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" which translates to ""blue yellow"". The sequence ""walm"" has an output of two ""yellow"" and ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red"".

In the third example:
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green""
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both at the beginning and at the end of the series, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" irrespective of its position.

In the fourth example:
- ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue""
This sequence also places ""wif"" translating to ""red"" despite the different context of surrounding words.

In the fifth example:
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green""
Here again, the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" at the beginning of the sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, we can try to decipher the meaning of the word ""wif"" by looking at the colors that correspond to its usage and the context it appears in. 

In every output, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". No matter what other words (""lug"", ""bluf"", ""zup"", ""walm"", ""dax"") are around it, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". Other words correspond to their own unique colors, too.

- In the second example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" becomes ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"", and ""zup"" is where ""yellow"" appears right after ""blue"".

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" and the corresponding color is red, which is the same as ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word immediately preceding it. ""Bluf"" takes the color that corresponds to the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,108,bluf

3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"", the output becomes ""blue"".
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", the output becomes ""red"".

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If no word comes before it (which is not demonstrated in the examples), we cannot determine the color and would need more examples to infer a rule.

Example 2: ""dax walm zup lug walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Here again, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" hence, green is repeated three times, and later ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in blue being repeated three times after it is first mentioned.

Example 3: ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and it's repeated two more times.

- In the second example, ""walm"" again follows ""dax,"" and the output repeats ""green green green."" However, when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which supports the previous suggestion that ""walm"" is a repeater of the color of the preceding word.
- The third example has ""walm"" following ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color that corresponds to the preceding word.
- The fourth example reaffirms this rule, as ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and produces ""blue blue blue,"" just like when ""lug"" is by itself.

Rule: The term ""walm"" requires that the color associated with the preceding word be repeated for the remaining output sequence.",1.0,109,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that comes immediately prior to it in the sequence. 

1. In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""red red red"".
2. In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""blue blue blue"".
3. The third example is identical to the first and results in the same pattern of colors.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""green green green"".
5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""green green green"".

Based on these examples, we can determine the following rule:

Rule: walm -> leads to the repetition of the color word immediately preceding it, repeating that color three times.",1.0,109,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the output colors corresponding to the inputs, comparing the position and repetition of ""walm"" and the other words.

Inputs:
1. zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
2. wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
3. zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
4. dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
5. wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green

Let's look for patterns:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""walm"" is at the end, and the color following the first color is repeated three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is in the second position, and we see that the color for ""dax"" is repeated three times before the color for ""wif"" appears.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is at the end, following ""dax"". Here the color for ""dax"" is repeated three times after two occurrences of the color for ""wif"".

We can derive some rules about the other words too:
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to blue (as seen in example 2).

The common pattern is that whenever ""walm"" appears, the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" (if there is one) is repeated three times. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to create repetition in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the immediately preceding word to repeat three times.

Note: The color for ""bluf"" is not provided, but it would logically fall into the same rule since it is followed by ""walm"" and the previous rule applies.",0.9,109,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a series of colors that follow a specific pattern depending on the word that comes before it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first and third inputs, ""walm"" follows the word ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows the word ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows the word ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green.""
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" is at the end after ""dax"" and the output is ""green green green.""

From the above, it seems that:
- The output color repeats three times.
- The color is determined by the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

Thus, based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in an input, the output is a color that is determined by the immediately preceding word, and this color repeats three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to trigger a triplet repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

walm -> meaning: The word preceding ""walm"" dictates the color, and ""walm"" indicates that this color should be repeated three times.",0.8,109,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" To derive a rule or pattern, we'll assess each example and the associated output:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the last three reds.

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the last three blues.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - This is the same as the first example and provides no new information.

4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""walm"" appears before ""wif"" and corresponds to three greens.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""walm"" appears at the end and corresponds to three greens again, similarly to when it followed ""dax"" in the previous example.

Considering the above examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to correlate with it being followed by three of the same color, and the color depends on the word that appears immediately before ""walm."" However, it's crucial to highlight that the word before ""walm"" doesn't always map to the same color when it's not in the position right before ""walm"" (e.g., ""wif"" is red normally but not followed by ""walm"").

With this in mind, let's formulate the rule as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" in an input sequence causes the output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Now, let's express the rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

walm -> meaning. Meaning: When ""walm"" follows another word, the output is three consecutive instances of the color corresponding to that preceding word.

Rule: If ""X"" is the word before ""walm"", and ""X"" has a corresponding color ""Y,"" then the output for ""walm"" will be ""Y Y Y."" If there is no word before ""walm,"" the rule cannot apply, and another rule must be found for cases where ""walm"" is at the beginning of the sequence.",0.8,109,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,110,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue"" in the outputs. Thus, the rule can be succinctly summarized as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,110,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' translates to the color blue.",1.0,110,lug

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,110,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,110,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue

Input: lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

Input: lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

From these examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" The word ""bluf"" seems to always result in ""red."" Notice that when ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the same relative position.

Therefore, the rule appears to be: wif -> red.",1.0,110,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Each occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output.",1.0,110,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns between the input and the output strings.

Looking at the second and fourth examples where the input is ""lug wif lug,"" the output is ""blue red blue,"" showing that ""lu""g correlates to ""blue"" and that ""wif"" correlates to ""red"" in both instances.

Now, we examine cases with ""bluf"" and ""dax."" In the first input, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue red red green blue blue,"" from which we can observe that ""bluf"" results in a ""blue"" output, but it is ""red"" when it is immediately after the nonce word ""wif."" Similarly, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 

In the third input, ""dax walm wif walm,"" the output does not follow a simple word-to-color mapping as the first two words ""dax walm"" result in ""green green,"" but the following ""wif walm"" sequence corresponds to ""green red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" might have some effect on the words following it.

However, since there are no other examples to support a more complex function of ""wif"" and every instance of ""wif"" is directly translated to ""red"" in the output, we can conclude that the complexity in the third example likely lies with the word ""walm"" which we don't have enough examples to decode, instead of ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""",1.0,110,wif
"Observing the provided examples, each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Whether 'zup' appears alone, at the beginning, middle, or end of a sequence, or adjacent to other words such as 'walm' or 'lug,' the corresponding output for 'zup' remains consistent as ""yellow"".

Here are the breakdowns that support this deduction:

- Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
  ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.

- Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
  The first ""zup"" corresponds to the fourth ""yellow,"" and the second ""zup"" to the sixth ""yellow"".

- Input: zup -> Output: yellow
  ""zup"" is the only word and corresponds directly to ""yellow"".

- Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
  ""zup"" corresponds to the last ""yellow"" in the output.

- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
  ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow,"" and we can deduce that ""walm"" refers to repeated ""yellow"" as it appears more than once.

Rule:

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the inputs is translated into ""yellow"" in the outputs, regardless of its position or the other words around it.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns of input and output.

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" producing ""red red.""
- Continuing to the third example, the pattern holds with ""walm"" producing two additional repetitions of ""green.""
- The fourth example again confirms this pattern, with ""walm"" causing a triple repetition of the last color, which is ""green"" in this case.
- The fifth example consolidates the pattern, with ""walm"" inducing a triple repetition of the last mentioned color, which is ""red"" here, followed by its appearance later inducing a triple repetition of ""blue.""

Rule: 
walm -> induces a repetition of the last mentioned color three times.",1.0,110,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze each instance where it occurs and the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

From the inputs and outputs we can start to deduce the following patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, it seems to generate multiple instances of a certain color in the output.
- The color that is repeated appears to be dependent on the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""
- Specifically, it seems that:
  - ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
  - ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
  - ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word preceding it, three times.

For example:
- In the first input (""dax lug walm""), ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue thus the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second input (""wif walm zup""), ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""wif"" corresponds to red thus the output is ""red red red.""

Given this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as:

Rule: walm repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times.",1.0,110,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the input-output pairs:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - After ""lug"" we see ""blue blue,"" which could indicate that ""walm"" stands for ""blue.""

2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - After ""wif"" we see ""red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could also mean ""red.""

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - This time ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and we get ""green green.""

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output again includes two ""green"" in a row.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""Walm"" follows both ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and the color ""red"" or ""blue"" appears multiple times following it.

From the patterns observed, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example, when ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the color green is repeated; when ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated; and when ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" the color red is repeated. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the output color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",1.0,110,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us analyze the correlation between the input and the output across the provided examples. We can observe that ""walm"" seems to produce multiple instances of the color that precedes its occurrence in the input:

1. dax lug walm -> green (from dax) blue (from lug) blue (from lug) blue (from lug)
2. wif walm zup -> red (from wif) red (from wif) red (from wif) yellow (from zup)
3. lug zup dax walm -> blue (from lug) yellow (from zup) green (from dax) green (from dax) green (from dax)
4. dax walm zup lug dax -> green (from dax) green (from dax) green (from dax) yellow (from zup) blue (from lug) green (from dax)
5. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red (from wif) red (from wif) red (from wif) green (from dax) yellow (from zup) red (from wif) blue (from lug) blue (from lug) blue (from lug)

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" produces three instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Hence, we can summarize the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color output of the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,110,walm
"To understand what ""walm"" means, let's break down each input and output one by one and look for patterns.

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". After ""walm"", the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". After ""walm"", we see ""red"" repeated two more times, then ""zup"" changes the pattern with ""yellow"".

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   Again, each word corresponds to a color change (lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, dax -> green). ""Walm"" is followed by repeating the color ""green"" two more times.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   The pattern for ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" continues, and ""walm"" is followed by repeating the color ""green"" two times before the pattern changes with ""zup.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   Similar to the previous examples, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that came before ""walm"". After ""wif,"" it repeats ""red"" two more times. Following the ""lug"" before ""walm"", ""blue"" repeats twice.

From these examples, the rule we can deduce is that ""walm"" causes the last color to be repeated two additional times before the next word potentially changes the color pattern.

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.",1.0,111,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule:
Based on the examples provided, each time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. There is a one-to-one mapping between ""lug"" and ""blue,"" regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence or the other words present.",1.0,111,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the provided examples.",1.0,111,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".",1.0,111,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time it is mentioned, the output is the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,111,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the Output. Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the color green shows up in the Output, no matter the position of ""dax"" within the Input sequence or the presence of other words.

Hence, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,111,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,111,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.",1.0,111,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,111,dax
"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to translate to the word ""red."" However, its presence also seems to trigger repetition in the preceding color words. 

Examining the examples closely:
- In the first example, ""dax wif"" results in ""green red,"" indicating that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""wif"" means ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" The word ""walm"" is repeated twice after ""wif,"" which corresponds to a triple repetition in the output. This suggests that ""wif"" causes the word that follows it to repeat in the following pattern: one occurrence of the word before ""wif,"" followed by ""red,"" leads to two repetitions of the color that follows ""wif.""
- Looking at the third example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" we find that ""lug"" and ""walm"" are repeated after each ""wif"" according to the same pattern we've observed: we say the color, then ""red,"" then the color as many times as the position of the ""wif"" in the sequence (second ""wif"" leads to two repetitions).
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the presence of ""wif"" still results in ""red,"" with preceding colors mentioned once before it.

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and causes the color word immediately following it to repeat a number of times based on the position of ""wif"" in the word sequence (e.g., ""wif"" being the nth word would mean the following color repeats n-1 times.)

wif -> ""red"" (triggers repetition of the following color word)",1.0,111,wif
"Analyzing the given examples:

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
Here, 'dax' translates to 'green', followed by 'wif', which seems to produce 'red'.

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
'zup' becomes 'yellow', 'lug' becomes 'blue', 'walm' becomes 'blue'. After 'wif', 'walm' now translates to 'red', which is different from the initial 'blue'.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
'lug' is 'blue', 'bluf' is 'blue', 'wif' changes the next 'lug' to 'red'. Another 'wif' changes the next 'walm' to 'red', and we see that effect continues as the following 'lug' is also 'red'. The final 'lug' is 'blue' again, as it is not preceded by 'wif'.

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
'dax' is 'green', 'bluf' is 'green', 'wif' changes 'zup' to 'red', but the next 'lug' is 'blue', so it seems the effect of 'wif' does not continue indefinitely.

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red
'lug' translates to 'blue', 'dax' to 'green', and after 'wif' we have 'red'.

From these examples, ""wif"" appears to change the meaning of the word following it to ""red"". However, this rule does not perpetuate indefinitely as evidenced by sequences where subsequent words revert to their original translations. Hence:

wif -> changes the meaning of the next word to ""red"".",1.0,111,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

In the sequences provided, each word prior to ""wif"" seems to map to a specific color:

- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""walm"" maps to ""red""
- ""bluf"" repeats the color before it

The word ""wif"" itself, following each sequence of color-associated words, results in the word ""red"". Additionally, the sequence after ""wif"" seems to repeat the color of the word that came just before ""wif"" as well as adding ""red"":

- In the first example, ""dax wif"" yields ""green red"". ""dax"" is ""green,"" followed by ""wif"" which results in an additional ""red"".
- In the second example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" yields ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"". The sequence ""wif walm"" gives us the repeating of ""blue"" (as ""walm"" was the last word before ""wif"") plus the mandatory ""red"".
- In the third example, repeating colors can be seen after ""bluf"" and a pattern with ""wif"" repeating the last color and adding ""red"".

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for ""wif"":

**Rule:** After the word ""wif"" is mentioned, the output sequence includes the color associated with the word just before ""wif"" followed by the color ""red"". Additionally, ""wif"" causes the previous color to be repeated before adding ""red"".

Hence, wif -> repeat the color of the preceding word and then add ""red"".",1.0,111,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we must observe how the output changes with each instance of ""wif"" and its position relative to other words. It appears that ""wif"" is associated with the output ""red,"" but we also notice that its occurrence impacts the output of the words around it in a patterned way. 

Here's the observed pattern:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" but when ""wif"" follows, we have an additional ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" When ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" we see a duplication of ""blue"" for every ""walm"" before ""wif,"" followed by one ""red."" Since there are two ""walm"" before the first ""wif,"" we have ""blue blue red,"" and since there's one ""walm"" before the second ""wif,"" we have another ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" as well. Again, every instance of ""lug"" before ""wif"" is output as ""blue,"" with an addition of ""red"" after each sequence.
- The fourth example confirms the pattern observed and the associated color outputs with the words ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup.""
- Finally, the fifth example consolidates our rule with ""lug"" and ""dax"" preceding ""wif.""

From the observations, it appears ""wif"" acts as a trigger to output ""red,"" and also duplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: wif -> Outputs ""red"" and also duplicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it.",0.9,111,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" shifts the color outputs in some pattern. To understand this pattern, let's break down each example and see how ""wif"" affects the output:

1. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug -> Output: green green red yellow blue
5. Input: lug dax wif -> Output: blue green red

Analyzing the first and fifth examples where ""wif"" immediately follows a word, the pattern is that ""wif"" generates a ""red"".

In the second example, ""wif"" occurs after three words, ""zup lug walm"". The word ""walm"" that comes after ""wif"" is then repeated three times in the output. Therefore, ""wif"" may indicate that the color output directly following ""wif"" should be repeated, with the count being the total number of input words up to (but not including) ""wif"".

In the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" occurs multiple times and the pattern of red following ""wif"" continues, along with the repetition rule inferred from the second example, though an extra ""red"" is included before the repetitions begin.

Putting these observations together, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

When ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the output ""red"", followed by repeating the color word that comes after ""wif"" in the input for a count that corresponds to the total number of distinct color words that precede ""wif"" in the input sequence up to that point. If ""wif"" is at the end, it simply outputs a ""red"" for the ""wif,"" with no further repetition.

Rule: wif -> outputs ""red"", followed by repeating the next color in the sequence equal to the total number of distinct color words before ""wif"". If no word follows ""wif,"" simply output ""red"".",0.8,111,wif
"From the given examples, we can induce that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow. (Meaning that ""zup"" represents the color yellow)",1.0,111,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue (assumption based on the similarity to the word ""blue"" and the repetition of the output ""red red blue"").
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""walm"" when it follows another color word, it repeats the output color of the last color word (""walm"" after ""lug"" gives another blue, after ""wif"" gives another red).

With these rules in mind, we can see that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,111,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine its position and corresponding output in each example:

- In every instance, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""zup"" does not appear to modify or be influenced by the words around it, as its output is consistently ""yellow,"" regardless of the context.
- The other words in the input (""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""dax"") correlate to other specific colors in the output.

Given this consistent mapping, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,111,zup
"To determine what ""zup"" means, let's look at each example and the positions where ""zup"" occurs.

1. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
2. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
3. ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green""
4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug zup wif zup"" -> ""blue yellow red yellow""

From the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" However, we should also consider if there's any contextual variation or additional rules.

Observing each example, ""zup"" does not seem to alter its meaning based on its position or the words around it. Regardless of where ""zup"" appears, the output is always ""yellow."" Furthermore, there is no additional pattern that suggests ""zup"" changes meaning in different contexts within the given examples.

Therefore, the rule is quite straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,111,zup
"Based on the given examples, each input word seems to correspond to a particular color in the output. ""Wif"" is consistently associated with red, ""lug"" with blue, and ""dax"" with green. The word ""zup"" each time results in the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,111,zup
"bluf -> green

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. ""Bluf,"" regardless of its position in the sequence, consistently translates to ""green.""",1.0,111,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the output in sequential order corresponding to the input:

Input: dax lug bluf
Output: green blue blue
Rule application: The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" seems to produce another ""blue.""

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green
Rule application: Again, the words ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. Notice that after the second occurrence of ""dax,"" the word ""bluf"" produces ""green,"" which follows the color given to ""dax.""

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
Rule application: Once more, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" follows the color of the preceding word ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Rule application: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" in between replicates the color ""red,"" which corresponds to the preceding ""wif.""

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Rule application: The pattern continues, with ""wif"" translating to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Bluf"" consistently replicates the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.

Summary:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" replicates the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.",1.0,111,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to translate to a color. We can determine the rule by examining the output color corresponding to the word ""bluf"" in each example.

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue. However, this is not consistent with the following examples. Upon closer examination, it can be seen that ""bluf"" produces the same color as the color word that immediately precedes it (when available).

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

- In the first example, ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""bluf"" and the output is ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" (green) comes before ""bluf"" and the output is ""green.""
- Similarly, in the third example, ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" (red) comes before ""bluf"" and ""dax"" (green) is the last color word before ""bluf,"" so the output is ""red"" then ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), and later another ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green); the output colors are ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively.

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to function as a repeat indicator, taking the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the previous color word. If there is no preceding color word, it is red (as seen in the fourth example where ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"").",0.9,111,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color and that its meaning might change depending on its context within the sequence.

In the first three examples, where ""bluf"" appears at the end of a sequence:
- ""dax lug bluf"" outputs ""green blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""blue.""
- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green yellow red green green,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" not ""blue"" as in the previous example.
- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

However, when ""bluf"" is not at the end of the sequence, it appears to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it:
- ""wif bluf dax"" outputs ""red red green"" — ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" outputs ""red red green green red red red blue red"" — here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax,"" repeating ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

Let's formalize the rule from these examples:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it if it's not at the end of a sequence. If ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it outputs a color that seems to correspond to the color of the last unique word preceding it (""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"").

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color of the previous word or, if at the end of the sequence, the color corresponding to the last unique word preceding it.",0.9,111,bluf
"From the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"". Let's examine each example and its output:

1. Input: dax lug bluf | Output: green blue blue
2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf | Output: red green yellow red green green
3. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf | Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
4. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif | Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Looking closely at the outputs for each occurrence of ""bluf,"" it seems that ""bluf"" is always followed by or converted into the color that was mentioned right before it (with the exception of the first example where it is directly translated as ""blue"" but there might be a reason for that, possibly because ""lug"" means ""blue"").

Based on this observation, we can define ""bluf"" as a word that repeats or doubles the meaning of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning: repeat the color word that comes directly before ""bluf"".",0.8,111,bluf
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm,"" then ""walm"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word before it.",1.0,111,walm
"Rule: walm -> the same color as the previous word. 

Explanation: When examining the pattern, each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a color that matches the color of the word right before ""walm."" For instance, when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is blue. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is red. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is yellow. This suggests that ""walm"" is a placeholder for repeating the color of the previous word.",1.0,111,walm
"Analyzing the color patterns in relation to the presence of the word ""walm"", we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the last word mentioned before it, as many times as there are total words in the input sequence, excluding the occurrences of ""walm"".

Let's verify this rule with the given examples:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Here, ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"" and its corresponding color is blue. There are five words in the input sequence excluding ""walm"", thus the color blue is repeated five times.

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to red and there are two words in the input sequence excluding ""walm"", so the color red is repeated two times.

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   ""dax"" is the word before ""walm"" and its corresponding color is green. There are four words in the input sequence excluding ""walm"", so the color green is repeated four times.

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to yellow. There are three words in the input sequence excluding ""walm"", so the color yellow is repeated three times.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and there is only one word in the input sequence excluding ""walm"", so the color blue is repeated one time, resulting in triple blue due to ""lug"" being mentioned thrice in total (once explicitly and twice due to ""walm"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the last mentioned word, equal to the number of total words in the input sequence excluding ""walm"".",1.0,111,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, for as many times as there are characters in the word ""walm"" (in this case, four times, since ""walm"" has four letters).

For example:
- In ""zup dax lug walm zup"", ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug"" is associated with blue, thus ""walm"" causes the output ""blue"" four times before continuing with the output for ""zup.""
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with red, so ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeated three times in the output.
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" has ""dax"" before ""walm,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to green, thus ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated four times before moving on to ""zup.""
- In ""zup walm lug wif,"" ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" prompts ""yellow"" to be repeated four times before ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it four times.",1.0,111,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"", meaning ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""lug"" corresponding to blue.
2. In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", which reinforces the idea that ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif"" which corresponds to red.
3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green"", once again showing that ""walm"" takes on the color of ""dax"".
4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" is taking on the color of ""zup"".
5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"", which means ""walm"" has the color of ""lug"", which is blue, and it repeats this color an extra time, implying that when ""walm"" stands alone with another word, it duplicates the color of that word three times.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word, with the number of repetitions depending on context; in a sequence, it's repeated once, when paired with only one other word, it's repeated three times.",0.8,111,walm
"lug -> meaning

"Rule: dax -> green

From the given examples, we can deduce that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is included in the output. Additionally, each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. This consistency across different examples supports the conclusion that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""",1.0,112,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,112,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" is mentioned in the output. This correspondence is consistent across all given examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,112,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the outputs pattern whenever the word ""dax"" appears, considering the appearance of other words as well.

In the first example, the only output we receive when ""dax"" appears with ""wif"" is ""green"" and ""red"".

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

The pattern repeats in the second example, reaffirming the association between ""wif"" and ""red,"" and ""dax"" and ""green.""

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug walm"" which results in a ""green"" followed by three ""blue."" It suggests that ""lug"" and ""walm"" might contribute to the repetition of ""blue,"" but ""dax"" holds steady with ""green.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

In the fourth example, ""lug"" and ""walm"" are both present, but ""zup"" is introduced after ""dax."" The pattern after ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" This supports the idea that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" produces repeated ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

In the last example, ""dax"" and ""zup"" alternate around ""wif,"" and we see the pattern of ""green yellow green yellow red."" This further corroborates that ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" with ""zup"" being associated with ""yellow.""

Input: dax zup dax zup wif
Output: green yellow green yellow red

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be consistent in the given examples:
Rule: dax -> green",1.0,112,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the examples given:

Input 1: wif dax
Output 1: red green

Input 2: wif dax (repeated input)
Output 2: red green (consistent output)

Input 3: dax lug walm
Output 3: green blue blue blue

Input 4: lug wif dax zup walm
Output 4: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Input 5: dax zup dax zup wif
Output 5: green yellow green yellow red

From the above data, it seems ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Furthermore, when looking at the other words and their corresponding outputs:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to translate to a repetition of ""blue"" (since it always follows a ""lug"" which is ""blue""), but increased by one additional ""blue"" each time.
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

However, ""walm,"" when following ""zup,"" changes its corresponding output to ""yellow"" repeated based on the instance count of ""zup,"" which suggests that ""walm"" actually repeats the color of the word preceding it.

Therefore, ""dax"" has a consistent translation irrespective of context to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,112,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, one can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the series of color outputs. Here's how you can come to that conclusion:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" occurs between ""lug"" and ""wif."" In the output, ""blue"" and ""red"" are also separated by ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""zup"" leads the sequence, and ""yellow"" is the first color in the output.

3. In the third example, ""zup"" is sandwiched between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" while ""yellow"" is between ""green"" and ""red"" in the output.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" is preceded by ""walm"" and followed by ""wif,"" whereas in the output, ""yellow"" comes after a repetition of ""blue"" and is followed by ""red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" is at the end, after ""lug,"" and in the corresponding output, ""yellow"" is also at the end, following ""blue.""

In all instances, ""zup"" matches up with ""yellow,"" regardless of the other words surrounding it. 

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,112,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's identify the corresponding outputs in each example. I'll first list the inputs alongside their outputs for clarity:

1. Input: dax zup lug wif lug | Output: green yellow blue red blue
2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif | Output: yellow green green green blue red
3. Input: dax zup wif | Output: green yellow red
4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif | Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup | Output: green green red blue yellow

Now we analyze where ""zup"" appears and what color appears in the output:

1. ""zup"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""lug"" | Corresponding color for ""zup"" is ""yellow""
2. ""zup"" appears at the beginning | Corresponding color for ""zup"" is ""yellow""
3. ""zup"" appears after ""dax"" | Corresponding color for ""zup"" is ""yellow""
4. ""zup"" appears after ""walm"" and before ""wif"" | Corresponding color for ""zup"" is ""yellow""
5. ""zup"" appears at the end after ""lug"" | Corresponding color for ""zup"" is ""yellow""

It seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position among other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,112,zup
"Observing the patterns in which the word zup is used and the corresponding output, we can infer a rule for the meaning of zup. 

In each example, zup is surrounded by other words which are translated to specific colors. The color that appears right before zup is translated to blue, and the output always has yellow before the colors that are adjacent to zup in the input:

- In example 1, the word before zup is 'dax,' which translates to green, and the word after zup is 'lug,' which translates to blue. The output for zup is yellow, followed by the translations for the words after zup.
- In example 2, the word before zup is not present, but based on other examples, dax seems to translate to green. The word after zup is 'dax,' and so the output for zup is yellow, followed by green which is the color translation for 'dax.'
- Example 3 shows zup between 'dax' (green) and 'wif' (red), with the output being yellow followed by red, the translation for 'wif.'
- In example 4, zup is preceded by 'walm' and followed by 'wif'. Since 'walm' translates to green, the output for zup is yellow followed by blue, which is the color following 'walm' in the input, and then followed by red which corresponds to 'wif'.
- Example 5 presents zup at the end and preceded by 'lug' which translates to blue. The translation includes yellow after blue, the color associated with 'lug'.

From these observations, we can conclude that zup translates to the color yellow followed by the color that is directly after zup in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow followed by the color translation of the word immediately following zup in the input.

If zup appears at the end, it would simply translate to yellow, as there's no subsequent word to translate.",0.8,112,zup

"Walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: The term ""walm"" indicates that the color word which comes before it should be repeated a number of times. Looking at the examples:

   Output: yellow red red red blue

Finally, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and similar to all other examples, ""walm"" causes the color following it (""red"" in this case) to appear three times before moving onto ""blue"" for ""lug.""

From the observations, we can extract the following rule for ""walm"":

"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word 'dax' correlates to the output 'green'. Whenever 'dax' appears in the input, 'green' appears in the output. It does not seem to matter where 'dax' appears in the sequence; it consistently maps to the output 'green'. 

Further investigation of the other words and their consistent mapping to colors suggests that each word translates to a specific color: 'wif' translates to 'red', 'bluf' translates to 'blue', and 'lug' translates to 'blue'. 'Walm' is a bit harder to deduce with only one instance given, but as 'walm' results in triple 'green' in the output, and each word seems to correlate to one color, it is possible that 'walm' could mean 'green green green', although without further evidence this is speculative.

Given this information, we can induce the following rule:

- Whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

This direct correlation appears consistent across all examples and does not seem to be influenced by the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or by the words surrounding it. Each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to an occurrence of ""red"" in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the input and output patterns. Note that only the output colors immediately following ""walm"" are considered in this deduction.

4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Looking at the patterns, it seems that whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the same color is repeated in the output three times immediately after the word ""walm,"" matching the color associated with the word that appears right before ""walm."" For example, in the first input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times. In the second input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" generates a sequence of three colors in the output which match the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm.""

Walm -> meaning: walm causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the prior word three times.",1.0,113,walm
"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately after ""walm"". The number of repetitions is three, matching the number of the word ""walm"" that appeared in the input.

For example, in the second input ""lug walm wif lug"", the color blue is associated with ""lug"", and after ""walm"" the word ""lug"" appears again, resulting in ""blue blue blue"". Since ""wif"" does not repeat a color before it, it simply translates to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word three times. If ""walm"" occurs at the end of the input, there is no color to repeat.

Let's recap the examples with this rule in mind:

- ""dax walm"": The color corresponding to ""dax"" is green. Thus, it's green repeated three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug"": ""lug"" is blue, so repeat blue three times, followed by ""wif"" which translates to red, then ""lug"" again for blue.
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"": ""zup"" is yellow, so repeat yellow three times, followed by ""dax"" which is green then ""zup"" for yellow, ""dax"" for green, and ""wif"" for red.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"": Ignore ""walm"" because the word after it (""lug"") is repeated and not introduced for the first time, so the preceding words are translated normally. Thus, blue for ""lug"", blue for ""bluf"", green for ""dax"", then ""lug"" for blue, yellow for ""zup"", and repeat yellow three times for ""walm"", followed by blue for the last ""lug"".
- ""lug zup walm lug"": ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which is blue, so it repeats blue three times.

Hence, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is confirmed with the examples.",1.0,113,walm
"Observing the outputs following the input word ""walm,"" we can infer the following:

- After ""dax walm"", the output is ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""walm"" could mean to repeat the previous color once more.
- After ""lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"". Similarly, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""walm"" again seems to mean to repeat the previous color once more.
- After ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and again, ""walm"" is resulting in the repetition of ""yellow"".

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word preceding ""walm"" two additional times, making a total of three occurrences of that color in a row.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color two additional times (total three repetitions).",0.8,113,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. Notice that anytime ""walm"" is used, the word right before it is repeated in the output as ""yellow"" for each instance that it appears before ""walm"". Here's a closer examination:

1. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and translates to ""green green green,"" implying that ""walm"" causes the word before it to repeat as ""green"" multiple times in the output (specifically, twice).

2. Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and results in ""blue blue blue,"" following the same pattern as above. The word after ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and it translates to ""red"" once, followed by ""lug"" again which translates to ""blue"".

3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated into ""yellow yellow yellow,"" adhering to the established rule. ""dax"" after ""walm"" leads to a single ""green,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and following the pattern, ""dax"" turns into ""green,"" and ""wif"" into ""red"".

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - In this example, ""lug"" is again before ""walm"" leading to the ""blue blue blue"" sequence. ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" correspond to different colors, and ""walm"" does not appear to directly influence these.

5. Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - Similar to previous instances, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and after ""walm,"" which leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating the repetition effect of ""walm"" on the preceding word.

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the word immediately before it to be translated to ""yellow"" and to be repeated three times in the output. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> when ""walm"" follows a word, that word is output three times as ""yellow"" in the output sequence.",0.8,113,walm
"Consider the given examples:

1. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red

2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

3. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red

4. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

5. Input: lug dax lug
   Output: blue green blue

Analyzing the patterns:

- Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is correlated with ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context surrounding it.
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".
- The word ""walm"" is not present in the input and outputs containing ""lug"", ""dax"", or ""wif"". However, by looking at the sequence in the second example, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely generates the output ""blue"" multiplied by the number of letters in the word ""walm"", which is 4, hence ""blue blue blue blue"".

Based on the above deductions, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,114,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,114,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Here is the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is followed by ""wif bluf"" which translates to ""red red."" The only color not referenced by the other words is ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" which is translated to three consecutive ""blue"" indicating ""lug"" must also be ""blue"" to maintain the pattern.
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf wif"" which are translated as ""blue red,"" again suggesting ""lug"" itself is ""blue.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"" consistently.

5. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   - ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""dax"" to green. The presence of ""walm"" in this case doesn't change the output from green, and it is not clear what ""walm"" corresponds to based on this example alone.

From the given examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,115,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color green, no matter the context in which it appears.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,115,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,115,wif
"Rule: wif -> ""red"". Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,115,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif"", let's examine each instance where it occurs and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   Here, ""wif"" is between ""lug"" and ""bluf"", which translate to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively.

2. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   The sequence ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue"".

3. Input: zup wif dax
   Output: yellow red green
   ""wif"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax"", which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively.

4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   Again, ""wif"" is between ""zup"" and ""bluf"", which translate to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively.

5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" and ""dax"", which convert to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

Based on the examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. In each instance, ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red"" appearing once or twice in the output (once if ""wif"" is the first word, twice if it's between two other words).

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs provided. However, how many times ""red"" appears seems to be dependent on the position of ""wif"". If ""wif"" is the first word, it is followed by a single ""red""; if it is between two other words, it is followed by two ""reds"". This suggests a rule where ""wif"" adds one extra ""red"" if it is not in the first position. However, there isn't enough information to confirm the latter part of the rule since all examples provided with ""wif"" in the middle have ""bluf"" as the following word, which itself translates to ""red.""

For a more precise rule, we would need more data, especially examples where ""wif"" is followed by words other than ""bluf"".

Verbally, the current observed rule is:
wif -> ""red"" (potentially indicating one or more occurrences based on its position and adjacent words)",1.0,115,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to indicate a color change or translation rule. Specifically, it translates to the word ""red"". This is evident because whenever ""wif"" is present before another word representing a color, the output color section corresponding to ""wif"" is always ""red"". No matter the position of ""wif"" in the sequence, the rule applies consistently.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,115,wif
"Observing the examples and the corresponding outputs, let's analyze the patterns:

1. ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"", which suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red.""

2. ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" turns into ""red blue blue yellow yellow green,"" again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue"" (in this instance, it seems ""bluf"" can correspond to both ""red"" and ""blue"" depending on its position or surrounding words), ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

3. ""zup wif dax"" yields ""yellow red green,"" and we see ""wif"" as ""red"" once more.

4. ""zup wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow red red,"" continuing the pattern of ""wif"" standing for ""red.""

5. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" and ""wif"" is consistent with ""red.""

Consistently across all examples, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" There might be further subtle rules regarding the meaning of ""bluf"" as it has been used to represent two different colors (""red"" and ""blue"") in the output. However, based on what we've been asked to deduce, that variation is not related to the meaning of ""wif,"" which remains constant.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,115,wif
"Based on the provided examples, I will infer the meaning or rule for the word ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""wif zup lug zup lug"" is translated to ""red yellow blue yellow blue."" Here we see that ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow,"" which also appears between other colors.
- In the second example, ""lug dax zup lug wif"" becomes ""blue green yellow blue red."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The third example, ""zup bluf,"" is turned into ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup"" is ""blue yellow,"" which further signifies that ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm zup"" translates as ""green green green yellow,"" once more appointing ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position or context within the list of words. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,115,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,115,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. When ""zup"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow.""
3. When ""zup"" appears after ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
4. When ""zup"" appears alone after ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow.""
5. When ""zup"" appears after ""dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow.""

From each of the examples given, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" no matter what the preceding word is. Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" maintains the same output independently of context.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,115,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of other words surrounding it.",1.0,115,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"" consistently, regardless of the context in which it appears. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: zup translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,115,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to an output pattern of repeated colors. The color that is repeated is the color that corresponds to the word or segment preceding ""bluf"". The rule for ""bluf"" appears to be repeating the color that would be outputted by the word immediately before it.

Here is the pattern observed:

- In ""dax zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, so ""bluf"" produces a second yellow.
- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" still corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" again produces another yellow.
- In ""dax zup lug bluf"", ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to the color blue, so ""bluf"" results in a second blue.
- In ""dax lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" yields another blue.
- In ""wif dax bluf"", ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to green, therefore ""bluf"" entails a repetition of the color green.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word right before ""bluf"".",1.0,115,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output colors correspond to the input words in a manner where each word has a specific associated color. The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax"" and the color ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup."" When it follows ""lug,"" it is ""blue."" When it does not follow ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug,"" such as in the last example, it is still ""green,"" which might indicate that ""green"" is the default association unless modified by the presence of specific words like ""zup"" or ""lug.""

With the provided data, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors depending on the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" is ""green."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" is ""blue."" If ""bluf"" follows any other word or if there's no specific modifier word before it, the default color is ""green.""

Thus:

bluf -> meaning:

- After ""dax"": green
- After ""zup"": yellow
- After ""lug"": blue
- Default/no specific modifier: green",1.0,115,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it. 

Explanation: It seems that 'bluf' takes on the color of the word before it. 

- In ""dax zup bluf,"" 'bluf' takes the color of 'zup,' which is yellow.
- In ""zup bluf,"" again 'bluf' is yellow, following the color of 'zup.'
- In ""dax zup lug bluf,"" 'bluf' is blue, matching the color of 'lug.'
- In ""dax lug bluf,"" 'bluf' once again is blue, following 'lug.'
- In ""wif dax bluf,"" 'bluf' takes the green color from 'dax.'

Therefore, if the word before 'bluf' is 'dax,' the output is green; if it's 'zup,' the output is yellow; if it's 'lug,' the output is blue; and if it's 'wif,' the output is red.",1.0,115,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is translated into the output color green, but only when preceded by the word ""dax."" When ""bluf"" appears without ""dax"" before it, the output is not green, but in the first two example pairs, it is yellow. In the last pair, with ""lug"" before ""bluf"", the output is blue. The dependency on the preceding word suggests that ""bluf"" is influenced by context.

However, to provide a specific meaning or rule for ""bluf"", we would need more information or examples that clarify how ""bluf"" behaves in the absence of these specific words, like ""dax"" or ""lug"". As it stands, the translation of ""bluf"" into a color in the output seems to directly depend on the word that comes before it:

- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" yields the color green.
- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" yields the color blue.
- ""bluf"" following ""zup"" with no other preceding context yields the color yellow.
- No information is provided on what ""bluf"" translates to when it appears without any of these context-giving words, or in different contexts.

Therefore, the tentative rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates into a color that depends on the preceding word, with ""dax"" resulting in green, ""lug"" resulting in blue, and ""zup"" (in the provided context) resulting in yellow.",0.9,115,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to examine the patterns between the inputs and outputs:

- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue""
- ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue""
- ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""

From the data provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"" when it appears before ""bluf.""
2. The word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"" when it appears before ""bluf.""
3. The word ""lug"" results in the output ""blue,"" and when it comes with ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
4. When ""bluf"" is the last input word, the last color in the output is repeated/doubled.

Given these observations, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" doubles the last color in the output sequence. If ""bluf"" follows a color-indicating word, the corresponding color is repeated.",0.8,115,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine how the output changes in examples where ""walm"" is included compared to where it is absent. Here is the analysis:

1. In every instance of ""walm"" being used, the output is a repetition of the color that precedes it.
2. The number of repetitions of the color seems to depend on the position of ""walm"" among other words:
   - If ""walm"" is after a single color (e.g., ""dax walm""), the preceding color is repeated three times.
   - If ""walm"" is after two different colors (e.g., ""wif bluf dax walm""), the last color before ""walm"" is repeated three more times in the output, making it a total of four times because ""dax"" itself translates to ""green.""
   - If ""walm"" directly follows a sequence of the same color (e.g., ""lug walm""), it repeats the sequence three more times.

Based on these observations, it's evident that the rule for ""walm"" in this context is that it triggers the repetition of the color word immediately preceding it in the output, repeating it a number of times based on its position relative to other color words—usually three additional times but repeated alongside the existing occurrences of that color.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color in the output multiple times (typically three more times).",0.9,115,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the instances in which the word is used and the corresponding output:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

Considering these examples, we can attempt to isolate the effect of ""walm"":

In ex. 1, after ""walm"" appears, the output is ""green green green,"" even though the input words that follow ""walm"" are not present. 
In ex. 2, after ""walm"" appears, the output is a single ""yellow,"" independent of ""zup."" 
In ex. 3, the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and both produce ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" might be extending the color sequence initiated by the previous word.
In ex. 4, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" but the output sequence starts with ""yellow,"" the color for ""zup,"" and then continues with ""green"" corresponding to ""dax,"" and ends with ""yellow"" again for the last ""zup."" 
In ex. 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which is an extension of the color pattern for ""lug.""

From these examples, it seems ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it in a sequence of three. If it appears at the end of the input, there's no color following it to be repeated. 

So, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the word immediately before it thrice. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it does not prompt any additional output beyond this repetition.",0.8,115,walm
"To induce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns associated with the input and output examples given:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
2. Input: lug walm zup       | Output: blue blue blue yellow
3. Input: dax walm           | Output: green green green
4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup | Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
5. Input: dax lug walm       | Output: green blue blue blue

From the above patterns, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word before it. Looking at the examples:

- In Example 1, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""walm"" results in additional green color outputs.
- In Example 2, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with blue, followed by repeated blue outputs for ""walm.""
- In Example 3, ""dax"" is again associated with green, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the green color.
- In Example 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output after ""zup"" is a repeated yellow. However, ""zup"" has been repeated, which leads to the non-consecutive output of yellow after ""walm."" This suggests ""walm"" generates a repeat of the color based on the last unique color-word mapping.
- In Example 5, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" repeats the blue color.

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the output color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: Walm -> Repeats the output color of the immediately preceding word.",0.8,115,walm
"Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example ""wif bluf dax walm"", the output is ""red red green green green"". Comparing to the other examples, it seems that ""wif"" correlates to ""red"" and ""dax"" correlates to ""green"". Following this pattern, ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and extends the ""green"" sequence by one additional ""green"".

- In the second example ""lug walm zup"", the output is ""blue blue blue yellow"". Here ""lug"" seems to correlate with ""blue"", but there's no ""dax"". The ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and adds two more ""blue"" before ending in a ""yellow"" which is the output for ""zup"".

- The third example ""dax walm"" further corroborates that ""dax"" correlates to ""green"", as the output is ""green green green"". It seems that ""walm"" adds two more ""green"" following the ""green"" for ""dax"".

- The fourth example ""wif zup walm dax zup"" is complex. Translating the colors to the words based on previous examples: ""wif"" correlates to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and between these, ""walm"" is inserted. The pattern shows that ""walm"" continues the sequence of the color that preceded it by one extra instance, except when the following word is ""dax"", where it adds two additional instances of ""yellow"". This is hinted by the additional ""yellow"" following ""wif"" and ""zup"" before ""dax"".

- In the fifth example ""dax lug walm"", translating the words to colors seems consistent. With ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""lug"" as ""blue"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in continuation of ""blue"".

Based on the above examples, ""walm"" appears to continue the sequence of the color from the word immediately before it. If ""walm"" follows ""dax"", it adds two more instances of the associated color (green). If it follows any other word, it adds just one more instance of the associated color.

Rule: walm -> continues the color sequence of the preceding word's color. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" it adds two instances of ""green""; otherwise, it adds one more instance of the preceding word's color.",0.8,115,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output color pattern. To determine the rule for ""walm,"" let's look at each line carefully:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" 
   Without ""walm,"" we assume ""wif bluf dax"" might give ""red red green."" Adding ""walm"" adds two additional greens.

2. ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow.""
   Without ""walm,"" we would assume ""lug zup"" might give ""blue yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" here adds two additional blues.

3. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
   Without ""walm,"" we might assume ""dax"" gives a single green. Here ""walm"" adds two more greens.

4. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" results in ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow.""
   Without ""walm,"" we might assume ""wif zup dax zup"" gives ""red yellow green yellow."" Here ""walm"" turns the green into a yellow and adds an additional yellow before the green that should follow ""dax.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue.""
   Without ""walm,"" we might expect ""dax lug"" to give ""green blue."" Here ""walm"" adds two additional blues.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" duplicates the color that would have resulted from the word just before it. If there is no word before ""walm,"" or if its position is at the start, it does not duplicate anything. These conclusions rely on assuming that each nonce word (wif, bluf, dax, lug, zup) consistently maps to a single color in the absence of ""walm.""

Rule: Walm -> meaning. ""walm"" duplicates the color output of the word before it, adding two instances of that color to the pattern. If ""walm"" is the first word or no previous word exists, it might not add any output or its effect isn't observed.",0.8,115,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words, ""lug"" results in ""blue"". Thus, the rule seems to be:

"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates into the color ""green."" Each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the list of words.

Hence, the rule is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> green",1.0,116,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

2. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
3. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
4. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
5. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it is translated to the color that the previous word represents.

Using the pattern observed, we can induce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the same color value as the word directly before it in the list.

Now let's verify the rule with the examples provided:

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
Verification: ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green
Verification: ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""green.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
Verification: ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""green.""

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
Verification: ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""blue.""

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red
Verification: ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""red.""

Given the consistent application of this rule across the examples, we can confidently report:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color value of the preceding word.",1.0,116,bluf
"Analyzing the data points given and corresponding output:

1. When the input includes ""wif zup bluf wif dax,"" the output follows the pattern red yellow yellow red green. Both instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red,"" suggesting ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The word ""dax"" aligns with ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" is between the two yellows, it suggests ""bluf"" also means ""yellow.""

2. In ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" the output is blue red blue green green. Again, ""wif"" aligns to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Lug"" in the first and third positions outputs ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" at the end outputs ""green."" However, this conflicts with the first example where ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" The common denominator is that ""bluf"" matches the color of the word following it, which in this case is ""dax,"" meaning ""green.""

3. For ""dax bluf wif zup dax,"" the output is green green red yellow green. The word ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" (red) and the corresponding output color for ""bluf"" is ""green.""

4. In ""lug bluf,"" which outputs blue blue, ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the preceding word, ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

5. For ""wif bluf lug dax wif,"" the resulting sequence is red red blue green red. ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" and the output for ""bluf"" in this case is ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""

Considering the patterns, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it mimics the color of the preceding word or of the word after it when it is at the beginning of a sequence. The word ""bluf"" reflects the color of a neighboring word (either before or after) in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the adjacent word in the output sequence. If ""bluf"" is preceded by another word, it takes on the color of that word. If ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence, it takes on the color of the following word.",0.8,116,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the following pattern can be discerned:

- In examples 1 and 3, `bluf` is followed or preceded by `wif`, which is associated with the color red, and in both instances, `bluf` corresponds to the color yellow.
- In example 2, `bluf` is at the end of the sequence and is associated with the color green.
- In example 4, `bluf` stands alone and is repeated twice, with the output being blue both times.
- In example 5, `bluf` is followed by `lug`, associated with blue, and precedes `dax`, associated with green, yielding red for `bluf`.

From these observations, we can determine that the color associated with `bluf` changes depending on the neighboring words or context. The color for `bluf` tends to be unique and not repeated if it is next to different context words (wif, dax, lug).

The most consistent observation is that when `bluf` is next to `wif`, it corresponds to yellow, and when it occurs in isolation, it is blue. However, these rules are not sufficient to determine the meaning of `bluf` in all contexts, as in example 5, where we would need additional examples or rules to ascertain why `bluf` corresponds to red.

So, the partial rule we can induce is:
- bluf -> yellow when following or preceding wif
- bluf -> blue when repeated and not adjacent to any other context words

Rule: `bluf`'s meaning (color association) changes depending on adjacent words; however, certain contexts show consistent color mappings (yellow next to `wif`, blue when isolated). Further examples or rules would be needed to fully determine `bluf`'s meaning in all contexts.",0.6,116,bluf

"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the color associated with the previous word, up to three additional times, making a total of four instances including the first mention. If ""walm"" occurs twice in a row, the repetition pattern is also doubled for the associated color.

Here are the breakdowns of the examples given:

- In the first example: ""dax zup walm wif walm"", ""dax"" equates to the color green, ""zup"" to yellow. ""Walm"" after ""zup"" makes ""yellow"" appear four times total, then ""wif"" turns into red once, and again ""walm"" after ""wif"" makes ""red"" appear three more times, totaling four reds.

- In the second example: ""lug dax walm wif"", ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, and following ""walm"" after ""dax"" there are four greens in total. ""Wif"" translates into red.

- In the third example: ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue and the ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates three more blues.

- In the fourth example: ""zup dax lug walm zup"", the sequence follows the same logic: ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue and is followed by ""walm"", which generates three additional blues, followed by another ""zup"" yielding another yellow.

- In the fifth example: ""dax walm zup lug"", ""dax"" is green and is directly followed by ""walm"", causing three additional greens, then ""zup"" is yellow and ""lug"" ends the sequence with blue.

Based on the examples, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> Induces the repetition of the color associated with the previous word up to four times in total (including the initial occurrence). If ""walm"" follows ""walm"", the repetition occurs for the color associated with the word preceding the first ""walm"".",1.0,116,walm
"To figure out what ""walm"" means in this context, let's analyze the pattern of the outputs in correlation with its position within the different inputs. It appears that ""walm"" is changing the output color to the one assigned to the word that directly precedes it, and also extends the sequence of that color.

1. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
2. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> blue green green green red
3. ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue
4. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
5. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> green green green yellow blue

It can be observed that after each ""walm"", the color that is repeated is the one that corresponds to the word directly before ""walm"". Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: Repeat the output color of the word that precedes ""walm"".",1.0,116,walm
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns emerging in each example and their respective outputs. Let's analyze each instance:

- For the first input ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" dax correlates with green, zup with yellow, and wif with red. After ""walm,"" the colors repeat in the following order: yellow, yellow, red, red, red. We don't see an immediate clear pattern since ""walm"" is followed by two different colors, yellow and red.

- In the second input ""lug dax walm wif,"" lug correlates with blue, dax with green, and again wif with red. After ""walm,"" we get green, green, green, red, indicating that the color green is repeated three times after ""walm.""

- The third input ""dax lug walm"" gives us green, blue, blue, blue, where we see the color blue repeated three times after ""walm.""

- For ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" we get yellow, green, blue, blue, blue, yellow, where the word ""walm"" is followed by repetition of the color blue three times.

- Finally, ""dax walm zup lug"" translates to green, green, green, yellow, blue. After ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.

Looking at these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" precedes a repetition of the color associated with the word that follows ""walm,"" and the color is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the last word (or followed by another occurrence of ""walm""), the previous color is repeated three times instead.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the next word (or the color of the previous word if none follows) to be repeated three times.",0.9,116,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's compare the inputs and outputs, looking at the patterns before and after ""walm"" appears.

- Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the following pattern is observed in the output: the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) is repeated multiple times followed by the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red) an equal number of times.

For example:
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm
  Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax zup"" and precedes ""wif walm"". From the output, we see three instances of yellow followed by three instances of red. Since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, the pattern before ""walm"" is not impacted by ""walm"" but rather the following pattern of greens and reds is linked to the presence of ""walm.""

- The presence of ""walm"" without ""wif"" following it seems to create repeated instances of the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green):

For example:
- Input: lug dax walm wif
  Output: blue green green green red

Here, after ""dax"" which is green, we have ""walm"" and then ""wif"". There are two additional greens followed by one red, with ""lug"" (blue) unaffected by ""walm"".

- When ""walm"" is directly after ""dax"", the pattern of greens does not include the initial green from ""dax"":

For example:
- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and we see repeated instances of the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue), with no additional greens.

- When there are no words after ""walm"", no reds appear in the output:

For example:
- Input: dax walm zup lug
  Output: green green green yellow blue

Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and we see two additional greens (total of three) with no reds following because ""wif"" is not present after ""walm"".

Rule:
The term ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color that came before it. If ""wif"" follows ""walm"", then there is an equal number of reds to the number of greens before the ""wif"". If ""walm"" is at the end or is not followed by ""wif"", the pattern is just the repetition of the color prior to ""walm"", without any reds after.

walm -> A command for repetition; it repeats the color of the word that came just before it, and if followed by ""wif"", it also causes red to repeat an equal number of times after the repeated color.",0.8,116,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and outputs:

1. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
2. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
5. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue

Now, let's break down the patterns involved:

- ""dax"" seems consistently associated with the color green.
- ""zup"" seems consistently associated with the color yellow.
- ""lug"" seems consistently associated with the color blue.
- ""wif"" is associated with the color red when following ""walm.""

Focusing on the word ""walm"" and what happens around it:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is repeated (rule 1, 2, and 5).
- When ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" the color red follows (rule 1 and 2).
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" or ""zup,"" blue or yellow doesn't repeat as in the case with ""dax"" (rule 2, 4, and 5).

From these observations, one possible induction could be that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word, except when the following word is ""wif,"" where it then indicates to switch to the color red. However, this rule is not entirely adequate since in example 3, ""walm"" following ""lug"" does not lead to the repetition of blue, but it continues blue, suggesting a ""continue the current pattern,” which happens to be blue in this case.

So, a rule might be that ""walm"" involves continuing the current color pattern or repeating the current color, but when followed by ""wif,"" it changes to red.

Rule: walm -> continue or repeat the current color, changing to red if followed by ""wif.""",0.8,116,walm

- Whenever ""lug"" is presented, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""zup"" and ""bluf"" appear, the output is ""yellow"" for both.
- ""walm"" seems to produce an output of ""red"" three times, which could indicate repetition or simply that ""walm"" itself translates to ""red red red"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,118,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" look for patterns between the inputs and outputs. Each word in the input seems to correspond to a color in the output. From the examples provided:

- When ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- When ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" appears in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" appears in the output.
- When ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" appears in the output.

Since the word ""bluf"" also corresponds to a color in the output, and based on the examples given:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by an output color ""red."" Since ""wif"" is already associated with ""red,"" it appears ""bluf"" does not alter this color.
- The second example repeats the color blue for ""lug,"" but when ""bluf"" is between two repetitions of ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might output a color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green.""
- The fifth example shows ""bluf"" between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup,"" not ""wif"" or ""dax."" However, the appearance of ""yellow"" here doesn't align with the pattern observed, as ""zup"" does not appear before ""bluf.""

One possible hypothesis based on the majority of evidence is that ""bluf"" outputs the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, except in the case where it may be the beginning of the sequence or an inconsistency in the examples (as seen in the fifth example).

Given the data from the examples and the potential inconsistency in the fifth example, the most likely rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Outputs the same color as the word immediately preceding it

However, the fifth example does not fit this rule, suggesting that there may be an additional condition or that the example is an exception or erroneous. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to generally mirror the color of the preceding word, but more examples or clearer context is needed to finalize the rule without anomalies.",0.8,118,bluf
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" affects the output as follows:

- When adjacent to ""zup,"" the word ""bluf"" yields ""red.""
- When adjacent to ""lug,"" the word ""bluf"" yields ""blue.""
- When adjacent to ""dax,"" the word ""bluf"" yields ""green.""

However, the specific rules for the word ""bluf"" in the presence of ""wif"" are less clear based on the given examples, as ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red"" and does not appear to influence the output of ""bluf"" in a consistent way.

Based on the given examples, we can induce the following:

- ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes or follows it.
- For ""zup,"" it is ""red.""
- For ""lug,"" it is ""blue.""
- For ""dax,"" it is ""green.""

However, without additional context or examples involving ""bluf"" with ""wif,"" it is difficult to establish a clear rule for that particular combination, other than that ""wif"" independently translates to ""red.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> changes its meaning based on the adjacent word; with ""zup"" it becomes ""red,"" with ""lug"" it becomes ""blue,"" and with ""dax"" it becomes ""green."" The effect of ""wif"" next to ""bluf"" cannot be determined from the provided examples.",0.8,118,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"", let's compare the input and output pairs.

- When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" results in ""green green.""
- The instance ""zup wif bluf"" repeated shows a consistent translation to ""yellow red red.""
- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" as seen in ""wif zup bluf wif dax,"" the translation for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning but instead its meaning might depend on the word that immediately precedes it. Let's try to deduce a pattern:

1. ""zup"" before ""bluf"" leads to ""red"" after the word indicating ""yellow.""
2. ""bluf"" after ""zup"" also leads to ""blue.""
3. ""dax"" after ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" after the word indicating ""green.""

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" suggesting that 'dax' is associated with the color green, and 'walm' again dictates the color be repeated three times.
- When 'walm' is followed by another word (e.g., ""lug walm wif""), 'wif' is translated to an additional color (red in this case), which is added to the sequence of repeated colors. Therefore, 'wif' does not seem to influence the 'walm' rule directly but rather adds to the output sequence after the repetition.

Therefore, the rule as inferred from the examples is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,120,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's look at the pairs of inputs and outputs to see where ""dax"" appears and what output it corresponds to.

3. ""dax"" -> green

Other words seem to represent other colors, with ""wif"" translating to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example. From the outputs, it seems that each input word corresponds to a color in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red.""
- ""dax"" seems to translate to ""green.""
- ""lug"" appears to mean ""blue.""

The colors are consistent across multiple examples, which supports the idea that each word directly translates to a specific color. There are no other contextual clues that suggest ""zup"" means anything else in combination with other words. Therefore, we can conclude:

4. dax bluf -> green green

Rule: walm -> ""red red red""",1.0,120,walm
walm -> meaning. Rule: The word 'walm' translates to a repetition of the color red three times.,1.0,120,walm
"Reviewing the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze each instance.

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

By inspecting the examples, we can deduce that the pattern for ""walm"" is followed by three repetitions of the color that would correspond to the word directly preceding ""walm."" For instance:

- In example 1, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and since ""wif"" translates to red, ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In example 4, the pattern repeats with ""wif"" before ""walm"" leading again to ""red red red.""
- In example 5, we see ""dax"" before the first ""walm"" and then three repetitions of ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax,"" followed by ""wif"" before the second ""walm"" and again three repetitions of red.

So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word directly before it three times.",1.0,120,walm
"To determine the meaning or rule for ""walm,"" let's compare each input with the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the new word ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""red"".

2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the sequence of ""walm wif"" is followed by ""green green red"".

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" might be a typo as it does not correspond to anything in the output, ""wif"" matches to ""red"", and ""walm lug"" corresponds to ""red red blue"".

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" produces three instances of ""red"".

5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the sequence ""walm wif walm"" results in ""green red red red"".

Gathering all the instances of ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs, it seems that ""walm"" is followed by three instances of the color that precedes it:

- ""walm"" following ""zup"" (yellow) leads to ""red red red""
- ""walm"" following ""dax"" (green) leads to ""green green red""

The only exception seems to be when ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" where it does not correspond to three instances of the color but appears to indicate a repetition of the preceding colors with the addition of a new instance of ""red"".

So, if we synthesize all these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be that it repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times, and if there is a color after ""walm,"" it shifts the sequence by inserting a ""red"" somewhere in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times, with alterations if another color word follows ""walm"".",0.3,120,walm

5. wif lug dax -> red blue green

From the examples, we can see that:

- Every time ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" is in the output.
- ""lug"" by itself results in ""blue"" as the sole output.
- When ""lug"" is preceded or followed by other words, ""blue"" is still present in the output sequence and maintains its position immediately following whatever precedes ""lug"".

"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,122,wif
"Looking at the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates to a certain color in the output. Noticing which color is produced when ""wif"" appears can help deduce its meaning. Let's break down each example:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" might mean ""red"" or double the following color.

2. In the second example, ""wif"" is precede and followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red,"" which again suggests ""wif"" could mean ""red"" or double the following color.

3. In the third example, the presence of ""wif"" results in the output ""red,"" which is consistent with the idea that ""wif"" means ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" twice, and we see ""red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" could mean ""red"" or once again, double the following color.

5. In the fifth example, the color ""red"" appears by itself after ""wif,"" which doesn't double the following color (as there's no color following ""wif""), so this supports the simpler hypothesis that ""wif"" represents the color ""red.""

Considering all of these examples, it seems clear that wherever ""wif"" appears, it translates directly to the color ""red"" in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,122,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color ""red"". In every input where ""wif"" is present, the corresponding output contains the word ""red"". Moreover, ""wif"" seems to result in the output ""red"" repeated once without any other additional context immediately identifiable from the examples given.

Considering the given examples:

- ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red""; ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" and is followed by another ""red"".
- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" results in ""blue red red green blue blue""; again, ""wif"" is followed by ""red red"".
- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green yellow red green green""; ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and the next instance of ""wif"" results in another ""red"".
- ""dax walm wif walm"" is mirrored by ""green green green red red red""; ""wif"" leads to ""red red red"", but in this case, the multiple ""red""s might be influenced by following ""wif"" with ""walm"", which also seems to translate to ""green"".
- ""zup bluf wif"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow red""; once more, ""wif"" is solely translating to ""red"".

From these deductions, while there is a clear association with the color ""red"", there is a potential nuance involving the repetition of ""red"" that might depend on context or what follows ""wif"".

Based on the provided data, the most consistent rule is:

Rule: wif -> ""red"" (and often followed by additional instances of ""red"", although the exact pattern of repetition is unclear without further examples or rules regarding what might influence the number of times ""red"" appears).",0.9,122,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the given examples focusing on the presence of the word ""wif"" and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to a double ""red"" when following ""wif""

2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to double ""red"" if it comes right after ""wif"" and ""blue"" if not
   
3. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   
   - ""wif"" first occurrence corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when not immediately following ""wif""

4. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" before ""walm"" leads to a triple ""red"" following it

5. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red
   
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" when not following ""wif""
   - ""wif"" on its own at the end is ""red""

From these examples, we can deduce the following pattern related to ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is a triple ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is on its own, the output is ""red.""

We can establish that the presence of ""wif"" changes the output of the words that follow it. In the case of ""bluf,"" it turns the output into a double ""red,"" and for ""walm,"" a triple ""red."" When ""wif"" appears without any specific word following, it translates to a single ""red."" This information suggests ""wif"" triggers a duplication (or triplication, as with ""walm"") of the color ""red"" for the word following it, or signifies the color ""red"" on its own.

Rule: wif -> Indicates the color ""red,"" and causes the word that follows to also become ""red,"" potentially multiple times depending on the specific following word.",0.9,122,wif
"By analyzing the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Let's look at the patterns:

Example 1: ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Every nonce word except ""wif"" corresponds to a unique color, and the word ""wif"" is followed by the same color (red) twice.

Example 2: ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red green blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue."" ""Wif"" precedes ""red red,"" suggesting it again could be doubling the color red.

Example 3: ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green yellow red green green."" This example is also consistent with the idea that ""wif"" results in ""red"" and is followed by the color that the next nonce word represents.

Example 4: ""dax walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red."" ""Wif"" is followed by ""red red,"" while ""walm"" that comes after ""wif"" is followed by the same color thrice, suggesting a possible rule that ""wif"" might denote repetition of the color that comes after its corresponding nonce word.

Example 5: ""zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red."" ""Wif"" comes last this time and is followed by just one ""red.""

By examining the consistent patterns, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" with the number of times ""red"" is mentioned following ""wif"" being reliant on some context or rule involving the other words. However, without a pattern of how many times ""red"" should be repeated based on the position of ""wif"" or the other nonce words around it, we can simply infer that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" but the repetition rule is unclear and requires more information or examples.

Rule: wif -> red (with an unknown rule about the repetition of ""red"" that could not be determined from the given examples)",0.8,122,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the other words around it. The colour yellow is not associated with any other input word besides ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,122,zup
"Based on the given examples, ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the word ""yellow"" in the outputs. Every time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the same position.

Therefore, the rule is:

Every instance where 'zup' appears in the input, the word 'yellow' appears in the exact same position in the output. There is a one-to-one correlation regardless of the position of 'zup' in the input sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,122,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns in both the input and output sequences.

Looking at the first example:

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

We can see that ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" in this context corresponds to ""green,"" which is the color that ""dax"" mapped to directly before it.

In the second example:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here, we again see ""zup"" mapping to ""yellow,"" and the ""bluf"" following it also maps to ""yellow."" The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word right before it.

In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, a similar pattern holds. ""Bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it:

- In the third example, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also maps to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also maps to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also maps to ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" adopts the color value of the preceding word in the sequence. 

Therefore:

bluf -> the color of the word before it in the sequence.",1.0,122,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""red"" in most instances. However, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""green"" instead. Therefore, the rule seems to depend on the word that precedes ""bluf."" 

To structure this as a rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""red,"" unless it immediately follows the word ""wif,"" in which case ""bluf"" means ""green.""

So, bluf -> ""red"" or ""green"" depending on the context described above.",1.0,122,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" means red when preceded by ""wif,"" and it means yellow when preceded by anything else.",1.0,122,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'bluf' by comparing the patterns of input and their corresponding output.

Looking at the first example:
- Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
- Output: red green yellow red green green

In this sequence, the word 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'green'. However, 'dax' also translates to 'green' in the output. To identify the unique rule for 'bluf', we must find a differentiating factor between 'dax' and 'bluf'.

The second example:
- Input: zup bluf wif walm
- Output: yellow yellow red red red

In this case, 'bluf' again corresponds to 'yellow', the same as 'zup'. But unlike 'bluf', 'zup' appears multiple times in inputs and consistently maps to 'yellow'.

The third example:
- Input: zup lug bluf wif
- Output: yellow blue blue red

Here, 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue', which is also the output for 'lug'.

Looking at all of the examples, we notice that 'bluf' does not correspond to a single color output but matches the color of the word preceding it. Thus, the rule for 'bluf' seems to be that it takes the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: 'bluf' -> takes the color value of the preceding word.",1.0,122,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,122,bluf

So, if ""lug"" equals blue, then ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow"". If ""dax"" equals green, ""walm"" after ""dax"" causes ""green green green"".

- In the second example, ""zup lug bluf wif"" converts to ""yellow blue blue red.""

- In the third example, ""lug wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue red yellow red."" Since ""lug"" is now confirmed to translate to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is still resulting in ""red"" both times it appears, our hypothesis that ""wif"" means ""red"" is further reinforced.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif walm"" yields ""blue red red red."" ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue,"" and since ""wif"" produced ""red"" and ""walm"" produced ""red red,"" our focus remains on ""wif,"" which consistently equates to ""red"" every time it appears.

"To find the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first break down the examples given and look for patterns:

Example 1: 
Input: lug dax walm 
Output: blue green green green
Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to produce multiple instances of the color that directly precedes it (in this case, green).

Example 2:
Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and generates multiple blues, then follows ""wif"" and generates multiple reds, again copying the color of the word preceding it.

Example 3:
Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif 
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
Similar to the previous examples, ""walm"" duplicates the color that appeared directly before it (here ""lug"" for blue and ""zup"" for yellow).

Example 4:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" duplicates the color red. Then ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" without duplication, as there is no ""walm"" following them.

Example 5: 
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""walm"" duplicates the color red again. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" without duplication.

Rule: 
""walm"" -> duplicates the color of the word that directly precedes it, resulting in three outputs of that color.

Example deduction:
""walm"" following ""lug"" (blue) -> blue blue blue
""walm"" following ""wif"" (red) -> red red red
""walm"" following ""dax"" (green) -> green green green
""walm"" following ""zup"" (yellow) -> yellow yellow yellow",1.0,123,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
2. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
3. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
5. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow

Observations:
- ""walm"" never translates to a unique color itself, but always repeats the color of the word right before it.
- The repetition occurs as many times as the ""walm""s succession; when there's one ""walm"", the immediate preceding color is repeated once more, and when there are two ""walm""s in succession, the color is repeated twice more.

Based on these observations:

- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" The walm after 'lug' repeats blue three times, and the walm after 'wif' repeats red three times.
- ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" The first instance of walm repeats the previous color blue three times, and the second walm repeats yellow three times after 'zup'.
- ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow."" Here, walm repeats the color red (from 'wif') three times.
- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow."" In this case, walm repeats the color red from the preceding color word 'wif' three times.

Thus, the meaning of the nonce word 'walm' can be deduced as a command to repeat the color of the previously mentioned color word three times.",1.0,123,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color of the immediately preceding word a number of times equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears in sequence. Here is how the rule appears to apply to the given examples:

1. Input: lug dax walm
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) once
   Output: blue green green green

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) once
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) twice
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue again
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) once
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) twice
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red again
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) once
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   Output: red red red green yellow

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) twice
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

Now, I can formulate the rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" as many times as ""walm"" appears consecutively.",1.0,123,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,124,lug
"Rule:
lug -> blue

Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,124,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.",1.0,124,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,124,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,124,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule that associates the word ""dax"" with a specific color. Each instance shows that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. This is evident as each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output in the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,124,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" correlates with the color green. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that follow, whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the color ""green"" is outputted. 

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.",1.0,124,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in how it's used across the examples. Here are the examples with ""dax"":

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. wif dax -> red green
3. dax lug -> green blue
4. dax wif lug -> green red blue
5. dax lug -> green blue

Analyzing the examples, we can try to correlate the word ""dax"" with the colors in the outputs. In each case where ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding output position:

- In examples 1, 3, 4, and 5, ""dax"" is the first word and is paired with ""green"" at the beginning of the output.
- In example 2, ""dax"" is the second word and is paired with ""green"" in the second position of the output.

Based on this pattern, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,124,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following correlations:

- ""walm"" consistently leads to a sequence of two greens.
- ""wif"" consistently results in a single red.
- ""bluf"" consistently leads to a sequence of two reds.
- ""lug"" consistently results in blue.
- ""dax"" when it appears before ""walm"", ""wif"", or ""lug,"" results in green, but the color that follows ""dax"" appears to be determined by the second word.

Considering ""dax"" in relation to the other words, it seems that ""dax"" itself may not have a direct and consistent color output except for green when it is the first word. Further, ""dax"" does not prevent the color associated with the following word from occurring. Therefore, ""dax"" could be associated with the color green when it is the first word in the sequence, but it does not overwrite the output that follows based on the other words present.

Rule: ""dax"" -> green when it is the first word; the word following ""dax"" determines the subsequent color output in the sequence.",0.9,124,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When 'dax' appears at the beginning of the input, the first output is ""green.""
2. When 'wif' appears after 'dax,' the second output is ""red.""
3. When 'lug' appears immediately after 'dax,' the output is ""green blue,"" suggesting 'lug' translates to ""blue.""

Using these patterns, we can attempt to establish the meaning of 'dax':

dax -> meaning

If we consider 'dax' as a standalone word or element that translates directly to a color, the output does not consistently match a single color across the examples. However, if we treat 'dax' as more of a contextual cue or modifier to the words following it, we observe that the presence of 'dax' influences the output color of the following words. The problem here is that 'dax' does not modify the color of 'lug' consistently since 'lug' always leads to the output ""blue"" after 'dax.'

Given that the examples provided have limitations and there is no clear, consistent transformation for 'dax' when used with different words, the best hypothesis we can formulate with the given information is:

Rule: 'dax' when used at the beginning of a sequence, indicates that the sequence should start with ""green,"" and the following colors are determined by the words that come after 'dax.' The word 'dax' itself does not represent a fixed color but rather a rule that impacts the color associated with the following word, except for 'lug,' which consistently leads to ""blue.""

Therefore:

dax -> 'green' as a starting cue for the output; the word influences the output color for the word that follows it without itself representing a fixed color.",0.7,124,dax

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" No matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence, the output is always ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,124,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" No matter the position of ""zup"" within an input sequence, the output always includes the word ""yellow"" in the corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,124,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,124,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that bluf corresponds to the color blue. In all instances where the word 'bluf' is used in the input, the output consistently includes the color blue in the respective position. Therefore, the rule derived from the examples is:

bluf -> blue",1.0,124,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue. Furthermore, we can observe that the color word that follows ""bluf"" is a repeat of the previous color word in the sequence. This can be seen more clearly in the first example, where the appearance of ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of ""wif"" (red) as the next color. Similarly, in other examples, the presence of ""bluf"" repeats the mentioned colors immediately before it.

So the general rule seems to be: When ""bluf"" is mentioned, it means to repeat the color that was mentioned just before ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the preceding color.",1.0,124,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to translate to the color ""blue"" in each instance. Here is the rule I deduced:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns and how they match the input and the output.

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to three repetitions of ""blue.""

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""green.""

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow"" (following the ""zup"").

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" here corresponds to three repetitions of ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""blue.""

From the above analysis, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word immediately preceding it, repeated three times. To be more precise, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that appears directly before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,124,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, with the repeated color appearing three times. Thus, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

For example: 
- In ""zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" means ""green green green.""
- In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, we can note the meaning as: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,124,walm
"Rule: walm means repeating the color of the immediately preceding word three times.

Explanation: When we look at the provided examples:

- ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is blue and ""walm"" makes it repeat three more times.
- ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green,"" where ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" makes it repeat three more times.
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue,"" where ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" makes it repeat three more times and does not affect the colors coming after it.
- ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow,"" where ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" makes it repeat three more times.
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is blue and ""walm"" makes it repeat three more times.

This consistent pattern shows that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color of the word right before it three additional times. Thus:
walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,124,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the immediately preceding color word in the Output. Here's the analysis that leads to this conclusion:

1. In the first example (“zup lug walm”), “zup” translates to “yellow” and “lug” to “blue”. The word ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""blue"".

2. In the second example (“lug zup dax walm”), we see “lug” as “blue”, “zup” as “yellow”, and “dax” as “green”. The ""walm"" again causes the color word that directly precedes it (""green"") to be repeated three times.

3. The third example (“wif lug zup walm wif lug”) includes two sets of words separated by ""walm"". “wif” translates to “red”. The ""walm"" in this case is followed by the sequence “yellow blue”, with “yellow” coming from “zup”. This indicates that ""walm"" influenced the color that came before it to be repeated twice.

4. In the fourth example (“dax walm zup”), “dax” translates to “green”, and “zup” to “yellow”. Between ""dax"" and ""zup"", the ""green"" is repeated twice, suggesting again that ""walm"" affects the color that comes before it.

5. The last example (“dax lug walm”) indicates that ""dax"" stands for ""green"" and ""lug"" for ""blue"". Following ""lug"", the ""blue"" is repeated three times, pointing towards the influence of ""walm"".

Taken together, these examples suggest that ""walm"" causes the color word that immediately precedes it to be repeated multiple times in the output. It seems the number of repetitions might be variable, but within the given examples, it repeats the previous color either two or three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" induces the repetition of the color word immediately before it, in the output multiple times (either two or three times within the given examples).",1.0,124,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to identify patterns that lead to the output:

Example 1: zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
Example 2: lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
Example 3: wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
Example 4: dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
Example 5: dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

From the examples, ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" correlate with ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red,"" respectively.

Analyzing the instances where ""walm"" appears:

- In Examples 1, 4, and 5, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it, with the repetition occurring three times.
- In Example 2, ""walm"" appears and repeats the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) three times.
- In Example 3, ""walm"" is followed by a triple repetition of the color corresponding to ""zup"" (yellow) occurring before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

"To identify what ""dax"" means, let's analyze the correlation between the input and output sequences. First we should note the presence and color output of ""dax"" in each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm  
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue  
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

4. Input: dax bluf lug wif  
   Output: green green blue red  
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

5. Input: dax zup bluf  
   Output: green yellow yellow  
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Across all examples, irrespective of the words that come before or after ""dax,"" its corresponding color is always ""green."" It seems from these examples that ""dax"" does not depend on context and has a consistent output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,125,dax
"By analyzing the provided examples, we can infer a pattern for the word ""dax"" and its corresponding color in the output. In each case, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input, it translates into ""green"" in the output.

Thus, the rule we can deduce is:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.",1.0,125,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's extract the output colors associated with its appearance in the given examples:

1. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", which corresponds to ""green yellow"".

2. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
   - Here ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by another ""wif"", corresponding to ""green red"".

3. lug dax zup wif -> blue green yellow red
   - ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""zup"", corresponding to ""green yellow"".

4. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
   - ""dax"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""bluf"", corresponding to ""green green"".

5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
   - Here ""dax"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""zup"", corresponding to ""green yellow"".

By examining the examples, we can see that every time ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" is produced in the output. Regardless of what comes before or after ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is the consistent output when ""dax"" is in the input. Therefore, the rule regarding ""dax"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,125,dax
"To determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine each input line and its corresponding output to find patterns:

4. Input: dax bluf lug wif

Looking at the outputs, the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green."" This is consistent across all examples regardless of the words that come before or after ""dax."" It seems that ""dax"" is not dependent on context, as its output remains the same in all cases. 

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,125,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at what color it corresponds to in different contexts within the examples provided.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red

Again, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Input: lug dax zup wif
Output: blue green yellow red

Here too, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

In this example, ""dax"" is the first word and it corresponds to the color green.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow 

Once again, ""dax"" as the first word results in the color green.

Based on these examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. There are no counterexamples given in which ""dax"" corresponds to any other color.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,125,dax

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color as follows:

- wif -> red

- lug -> blue

zup -> yellow.",1.0,125,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow."" Every instance of ""zup"" in the input correlates with ""yellow"" in the output. There doesn't seem to be any other context affecting this relationship, as ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,125,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. By looking at instances where ""zup"" is used across different inputs, we can deduce its corresponding color in the output.

- Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm -> Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
- Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow

From these examples, we can see that every time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,125,zup
"Reviewing the examples and comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can infer the following individual translations:

- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""walm"" -> ""blue""

`bluf` consistently corresponds with the color `red` in all of those instances where it isn't immediately next to another color word which also corresponds to `red`. Noticing that in the first example it is flanked by ""dax"" (green) and still outputs ""red"" twice, but in the third example where `bluf` is subsequent to ""wif"" (red) it outputs a red only once, suggests that `bluf` translates to `red` unless it directly follows another `red`, in which case its output is omitted.

However, if we analyze the final example where `bluf` is directly followed by ""wif"" (red), we see that both words produce an output of ""red"". This may be seen as contradicting the previous observation unless we notice that every instance of `bluf` either begins a sequence or is preceded by a color word different than ""wif"". This observation enlightens the previous rule, indicating that `bluf` does not produce a ""red"" when it is followed by another `bluf` token.

Rule: bluf -> red, but when bluf is immediately followed by another bluf, the second one does not produce an output.",0.9,125,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word translates to a specific color. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the contexts in which it appears and the corresponding color outputs:

- Example 1: ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" corresponds to ""blue green green red green"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Example 2: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Example 3: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Example 4: ""zup bluf lug zup"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- Example 5: ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not consistently correspond to a single color. However, it is notable that in Examples 4 and 5, ""bluf"" produces ""blue"" when it appears after ""lug,"" but in other contexts, it produces different colors.

To induce a possible rule, we need a hypothesis that can accommodate all instances of ""bluf"". Unfortunately, there's not enough consistent data to determine a clear-cut rule that applies to all situations given the variance in translation to colors in different contexts.

However, if we hypothesize that context (i.e., the surrounding words) may influence the meaning of ""bluf"", we could infer the following tentative rule: ""bluf"" might represent a color that is contextually dependent on the words that come before or after it.

Since the information provided isn't sufficient to determine a specific rule for ""bluf,"" the best I can do with the given examples is note the inconsistency and suggest that ""bluf"" is context-dependent or that we need more data to establish a firm rule.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each instance and the corresponding outputs:

2. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
3. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
4. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, we can try to find a pattern for 'walm'. 

In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue"", and from the second example, ""walm lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red."" Here, the word before ""walm"" has its color repeated after ""walm"".

In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, this pattern appears to hold as well. The word immediately preceding ""walm"" has its color output repeated once more before moving on to the next color pattern determined by the subsequent word.

So, based on these observations, “walm” seems to repeat the color output of the word immediately before it:

"From the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"". Observing the transition to the output, it appears that ""walm"" is responsible for the additional ""blue"" outputs immediately following its appearance.
  
- In the second example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" yields ""yellow green green green blue red"". Here, ""walm"" must be acting as ""green"" since the output ""green"" follows the introduction of ""walm"" before returning back to the ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" correspondences.
  
- In the third example, ""zup lug walm"" converts to ""yellow blue blue blue"". Similar to the first example, ""walm"" results in repeated ""blue"" outputs.
  
- The fourth example, ""lug walm zup walm"", provides an output of ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". Again, ""walm"" is resulting in a repetition of the color preceding it, which is ""blue"" for the first ""walm"" and then a repetition of ""yellow"" for the second ""walm"" after ""zup"".
  
- The fifth example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"", where we can infer that ""walm"" is causing the ""red"" to repeat an additional two times.
  
From these examples, we can derive that ""walm"" acts as a repetition operator for the color word that directly precedes it. The rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that directly precedes it two additional times.",0.9,125,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the association between its occurrences and the colors in the output sequence:

1. In the first example:
   - ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"".
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" but in this case, ""yellow"" is after the sequence of ""blue,"" so it's not directly after “walm”.

2. In the second example:
   - ""zup dax walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green blue red"".
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" occurs after ""dax"" which is ""green.""

3. In the third example:
   - ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue"".
   - ""walm"" is at the end and is followed by two ""blue"" without any other color in between.

4. In the fourth example:
   - ""lug walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"".
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the ""walm"" after is followed by another ""walm"" which seems to replicate the ""blue"" color, before finally being followed by ""zup"" for ""yellow.""

5. In the fifth example:
   - ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"".
   - ""walm"" is at the end and is preceded by ""red,"" acting similarly to ""blue"" in previous examples, followed again by ""red"".

From these examples, we can deduce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it until the color corresponding to ""zup"" (yellow) or ""wif"" (red) interrupts the sequence or the sequence ends. If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" or another ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated until the sequence is interrupted by ""zup"" or the end of the sequence.

Therefore:
walm -> repeat the preceding color unless interrupted by a change to yellow or red, or introduced after ""dax"" (in which case it repeats green) or followed by ""walm"" or ""zup"" (in which case it repeats blue).",0.9,125,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can observe how the output changes in conjunction with the presence of ""walm"" in the input.

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - Four instances of ""blue"" in sequence appear after ""walm"". The word ""lug"" is mapped to ""blue"", but ""walm"" seems to trigger an additional ""blue"" before continuing with the rest of the output.

2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - Two additional ""green"" appear after ""walm"". In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is mapped to green, indicating that ""walm"" may repeat the color of the word before it.

3. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - Two additional ""blue"" appear after ""walm"", again suggesting that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color beforehand.

4. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and ""zup"" which are mapped to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. In each case, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word twice.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - In this sequence, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" which is mapped to ""red,"" and the output shows a repetition of ""red"" three times.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. The repetition appears to occur twice, adding two more instances of that color to the output sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green."" Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There also seems to be an association between the other words (zup, walm, wif, lug) and other colors, but since the task only asks to deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we'll focus on that.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,126,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a rule for what ""dax"" means in terms of the output colors. Let's examine the patterns:

1. Whenever the input has ""dax"", ""green"" appears in the corresponding output.
2. The presence of ""dax"" does not seem to be influenced by its position in the input sequence.
3. No other word in the sequence is consistently translated into ""green"" other than ""dax"".
4. Each other word seems to translate into a set sequence of colors that are independent of ""dax"".

In conclusion, ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"" regardless of its placement within the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,126,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" maps to the output ""green."" There are no instances where ""dax"" appears and something other than ""green"" follows. This is consistent across all lines, including the line with the single input ""dax.""

Other words like ""walm"" and ""wif"" appear to map to different colors depending on their position or the context, but ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,126,dax
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the word ""dax"" can be inferred from the output patterns. Here are the observations:

- In every instance where ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
- The presence of ""dax"" does not seem to affect the color associated with other words (e.g., ""walm"" and ""wif"" seem to correlate with yellow and red, respectively).

From these observations, it can be determined that the appearance of ""dax"" results in the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be described as follows:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,126,dax
"Observing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the underlying pattern that defines the meaning of the word ""dax.""

1. Every time the word ""dax"" appears on its own or at the beginning of a sequence, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" appears after ""walm"" or ""lug"" or any word other than ""wif,"" the output is still ""green.""
3. When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" it outputs ""green"" followed by ""red,"" indicating a possible connection to the word ""wif.""
4. Other words such as ""lug"" and ""walm"" have consistent outputs (""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively), which do not seem to be influenced by the presence of ""dax.""

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words (it always generates the output ""green""). There does not appear to be any context in which ""dax"" generates a different output. The presence of the word ""wif"" changes the output following ""dax"" to ""red,"" but that seems to be a property of ""wif"" and not ""dax.""

Therefore:

dax -> green",0.9,126,dax

"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it would seem that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Additionally, the word ""lug"" appears to translate to the color ""blue"" and the repetition of a word like ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of its corresponding color. Thus, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

However, based on the repetition of ""blue"" associated with ""lug,"" and the occurrence of ""walm,"" there's a suggestion that ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" might correspond to ""blue blue blue,"" but more examples would be needed to establish this rule definitively.",1.0,126,wif

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" leads to the output of ""yellow"" each time it is used. It does not appear to modify or interact with the words that follow it differently; instead, it operates as a standalone term that contributes the same output each time.

The other words appear to correspond to different colors, with ""wif"" also always corresponding to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule we can induce from the examples is:

Rule: bluf -> ""red""",1.0,126,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each word corresponds to a specific color. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the consistent outcomes when the word appears:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is present, the color ""red"" appears in the output.
- The number of occurrences of ""red"" in the output is consistent with the number of times ""bluf"" appears in the input.
- No other input word (such as ""wif"", ""dax"", or ""lug"") results in the color ""red"" when ""bluf"" is not present.

From these observations, we can infer the rule:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,126,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the color patterns and where ""bluf"" appears in each input.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is always ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" might represent ""red.""
- However, when ""dax"" precedes ""wif bluf,"" the output switches to ""green red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might maintain its meaning as ""red,"" but ""dax"" influences the color before it.
- In an instance where ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax,"" such as ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" implying that ""bluf"" could also be ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is positioned between ""dax"" and ""lug,"" the output is ""green green blue,"" which is consistent with the pattern where ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""
- Given that ""bluf"" alone does not have an associated output, its meaning seems dependent on its position and surrounding words.

From these observations, the most consistent rule for ""bluf"" seems to be related to its position concerning other words. Based on the examples given, here is a potential rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it represents ""green."" The color representation of ""bluf"" is directly influenced by the word that comes before it.",0.8,126,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it looks like ""walm"" translates to a repeat of the color that corresponds to the word preceding it. For example:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which implies that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" indicates that the color should be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" again leads to the color being repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" hence ""lug"" must stand for blue, with ""walm"" ensuring it is said three times.

However, the last example includes ""lug zup wif,"" which leads to ""blue yellow red,"" followed by ""dax"" leading to ""green,"" but it doesn't directly affect the meaning of ""walm,"" as ""walm"" is not present after these words.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,126,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with a specific color and a repetition of the word representing that color three times. Here is the rule induction based on the examples provided:

- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" suggesting that when preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" means ""red"" repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that when preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm"" means ""blue"" repeated three times.

Note that ""walm"" alone does not have a color associated with it in the examples—it's always preceded by another word that seems to determine the color. Therefore, ""walm"" probably means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.""

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times. For instance, ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"" because the color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, and the presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" means to repeat ""yellow"" three times.

- ""wif walm zup walm"" resulted in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting ""wif"" may mean ""red"".
- ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue"" twice, suggesting ""lug"" may mean ""blue"".
- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"", with ""lug zup"" (immediately following ""walm"") resulting in ""blue yellow"", which fits with the previously noted color associations for ""lug"" and ""zup"", and ""wif"" potentially meaning ""red"" based on the second example.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" we should look at the pattern of colors that appear in each output following the word ""walm."" Here are the observations:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, a repetition of three colors followed by a distinct color appears in the output.
2. The repeated color seems to be associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
3. The distinct color following the repetition seems to be associated with the word immediately following ""walm.""

Analyzing the inputs and outputs: 

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", so ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the first color in the output is ""yellow,"" so ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and the last color is ""red,"" suggesting ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- The third input includes ""lug"" before ""walm"" and ""wif"" after ""walm,"" which matches the output pattern ""blue blue blue red,"" consistent with the first two observations.
- The fourth and fifth examples are also consistent with the first two observations when considering the positions of ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" in their respective sequences and the associated colors.

Based on this, we can induce a general rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the output will be a sequence of three colors corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm,"" followed by a single color corresponding to the word immediately after ""walm.""

Therefore:

walm -> Rule: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times, then follow it by the color associated with the next word.
",1.0,127,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it, continuing until a new color word or the end of the sequence is encountered.

In each of the examples, the word following ""walm"" is repeated for the number of non-color words that follow until either a new color word appears or the sequence ends:

1. Input: lug walm --> Output: blue blue blue
2. Input: dax zup walm wif --> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax --> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
4. Input: lug dax walm wif --> Output: blue green green green red
5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug --> Output: yellow red green green green blue

Here ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"", ""dax"" is translated to ""green"", ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" is translated to ""red"".

Using this observation, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color word that directly precedes ""walm"" until a new color word is encountered or the sequence ends.",1.0,127,walm
"walm -> repeated color of the word prior to walm.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it in the input sequence. The repetition continues until a new word that maps to a different color is introduced.",1.0,127,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given inputs and outputs.

Input: lug walm                     Output: blue blue blue
Input: dax zup walm wif             Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Input: zup lug walm wif dax         Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
Input: lug dax walm wif             Output: blue green green green red
Input: zup wif dax walm lug         Output: yellow red green green green blue

Looking at the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" has the following effects:
- There is a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding ""walm.""
- The number of repetitions equals the position of ""walm"" in the sequence minus one.
- If ""walm"" is the second word, the preceding color is repeated twice, indicating that the position of ""walm"" minus one defines the number of repetitions.

For example, in the first input sequence, ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" is in the second position, so ""blue"" is outputted twice after the color corresponding to ""lug.""

Using this rule, let's apply it to the rest of the input sequences:
- In ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""walm"" is in the third position, so the second color ""yellow"" from ""zup"" is repeated twice.
- In ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" ""walm"" is in the third position, so the color ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"" is repeated twice.
- In ""lug dax walm wif,"" ""walm"" is in the third position, so the color ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"" is repeated twice.
- In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""walm"" is in the fourth position, so the color ""green"" from ""dax"" is repeated three times

Based on the given data, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm,"" the number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence minus one.",1.0,127,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe the relationship between the input strings and their corresponding output strings. Let's align each input with its output to look more closely:

1. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
2. Input: dax zup walm wif | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax | Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
4. Input: lug dax walm wif | Output: blue green green green red
5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug | Output: yellow red green green green blue

Analyzing the input and output pairs, we should note the position and repetition of the words/colors. Let's list our observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color immediately following it in the output is repeated three times, except in cases where ""wif"" is also present after ""walm"" in the input; then it is followed by the color four times.
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" seems to modify the behavior of ""walm,"" causing an additional repetition of the output color, but it alone translates to ""red"" when it is not following ""walm.""

Now, applying these observations to infer the meaning of ""walm,"" the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next color word in the output sequence to be repeated thrice, or four times if ""wif"" follows ""walm."" There is nothing in the examples that indicates what color ""walm"" would correspond to when it stands alone.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the next color word in the output to be repeated three times, or four times if followed by ""wif.""",0.9,127,walm
"From the provided examples, the term ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" Therefore, we can conclude that ""lug"" maps to the color blue.

Rule: Whenever the word lug is mentioned, it translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,128,lug

"Given the examples, the word ""dax"" correlates consistently with the output ""green."" Regardless of position within the input sequence, or the other words present, ""dax"" always results in ""green"" appearing in the output sequence. This suggests that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green."" Other words appear to correspond with their own colors as well: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""walm"" is possibly linked to a repetition rule, since when ""walm"" appears once in the input, ""green"" is repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,128,dax
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,128,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the patterns associated with each appearance of the word and the corresponding output colors. The word ""dax"" is always present in the input, so we can ignore the instances where it is not a variable that determines the color.

From the examples given:

1. When ""dax"" appears by itself, the output is green.
2. When ""dax"" appears before ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm,"" the colors following ""dax"" are blue, red, and green, respectively, regardless of the order of the other words.
3. When ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" and ""zup"" but before ""walm,"" the output associated with ""dax"" is still green.

From these observations, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that follow it. Based on this, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as a rule associated with the color green in these examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,128,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,128,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

- The word ""dax"" always results in the word ""green.""
- The word ""walm"" results in ""green"" as well, as seen in the first and fourth examples.
- The word ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" as indicated in all examples where it appears.
- The word ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" as indicated in the first, fourth, and fifth examples where it appears.
- The word ""wif"" results in ""red,"" as seen in the third and fifth examples.

Thus, the rule appears to be that each nonce word ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color:

Rule:
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red",1.0,128,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that different words correspond to different colors and that the word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"" no matter where it appears in the sequence:

- Input: ""wif"" → Output: ""red""
- Input: ""dax wif"" → Output: ""green red""
- Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" → Output: ""red red green green green""
- Input: ""wif zup dax bluf"" → Output: ""red yellow green green""

From these examples, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,128,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at its occurrence and the corresponding output in each example.

Input: wif
Output: red
- Here, ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" and the output is ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""red"" for ""wif,"" so ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""wif"" appears first, followed by ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm."" ""wif"" translates to ""red"" once again. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" There's a pattern of ""red"" and ""green"" outputs increasing as new words are introduced. However, since ""walm"" does not have a direct translation, we infer it might build on the previous color with additional ""green.""

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green 
- ""wif"" is still ""red,"" so that remains constant. ""dax"" is ""green"" again. ""zup"" is a new word, translating to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" followed ""wif"" directly in another example resulting in two ""red"" outputs, it is likely ""bluf"" on its own would result in ""red"" as well.

Based on all the examples, a consistent pattern is that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Other words like ""dax"" and ""bluf"" have their specific color associations or rules, but ""wif"" is consistently mapped to ""red."" Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,128,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. Let's try to determine the color associated with each word by comparing the input and output pairs:

1. Every time ""wif"" appears, regardless of its position, the output includes ""red"".
2. When ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green"".
3. The word ""bluf"" appears twice and both times the output includes ""green"".
4. The only occurrence of ""walm"" does result in ""green"" in the output.
5. The only occurrence of ""zup"" coincides with the color ""yellow"" in the output.

We can thus infer the following correlations:
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""bluf"" also -> ""green""
- ""walm"" -> ""green"" (Though there is only one example with ""walm"", it is assumed it turns to ""green"" because it's the only new word paired with new ""green"" color in the output)
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

Rule: Each word is associated with a specific color as follows:
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- walm -> green (though this is based on a single example)
- zup -> yellow",1.0,128,wif
"wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,128,wif
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce the likely meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing the consistency of its output in relation to its position and occurrence in the inputs.

- Every instance of ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""
- Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence, the output ""red"" does not change.
- The presence of other words like ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and their corresponding outputs suggest that ""wif"" is not influenced by these words, as it maintains the same output.

Considering that ""wif"" generates a consistent output unaltered by its context, we can induce the following rule:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" repeats the color word that precedes it in the output. Here's the breakdown according to the inputs and outputs:

- ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color ""blue"" which follows ""lug"".
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" which follows ""wif"".
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green"" which follows ""dax"" twice.
- The repetition of the example ""dax bluf"" with the same translation ""green green"" confirms the previously observed rule.
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""green green red blue"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green"" which follows ""dax"".

Considering these observations, the rule governing the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the output color word that immediately precedes it. Rule: Bluf duplicates the preceding color word in the output.",1.0,128,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples, we need to look at the context in which it appears and observe the patterns:

- wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
- wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
- dax bluf -> green green
- dax bluf -> green green
- dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue

Based on the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it, duplicating it:

- When preceded by ""wif"" (which results in ""red""), ""bluf"" becomes ""red"" and is doubled to result in ""red red"".
- When preceded by ""lug"" (which results in ""blue""), ""bluf"" becomes ""blue"" and is doubled to result in ""blue blue"".
- When preceded by ""dax"" (which results in ""green""), ""bluf"" becomes ""green"" and is doubled to result in ""green green"".

Thus, based on the examples provided, the rule governing the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Duplication of the color denoted by the word immediately before it.",1.0,128,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.,1.0,128,bluf
"From the given examples, let's analyze the pattern between the inputs and outputs:

1. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. dax bluf -> green green
5. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue

Looking at the first and second example, the word ""wif"" leads to the output ""red"", while ""lug"" and ""dax"" produce ""blue"" and ""green"", respectively. The word ""walm"" seems to extend the color green, possibly indicating a repetition of the previous color word. 

The word ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color word that comes before it. In the first example, it follows ""lug"" which translates to blue, therefore ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue"". In the second example, it follows ""wif"" (red), hence ""bluf"" becomes ""red red""; and in the third, fourth, and fifth examples, it follows ""dax"" (green), translating to ""green green"".

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as repeating the color associated with the previous nonce word.

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated twice.
3. ""Bluf"" by itself after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated twice.
4. ""Bluf"" by itself after ""dax,"" and before ""wif lug,"" results in ""green"" being repeated twice, followed by ""red blue"" from ""wif lug.""

- In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" which causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times, then ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""red.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to one ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" may be irrelevant or corresponds to another ""yellow.""

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow
   Here ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
   In this example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here as well, it suggests that ""bluf"" is copying the color of the word before it.

3. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug | Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   In this series, after ""dax"" which is green, ""bluf"" again takes the color green. Also, after ""zup"" which is yellow twice, ""bluf"" is yellow both times, reinforcing the pattern.

4. Input: lug wif bluf | Output: blue red red
   Following ""wif"" which is red, ""bluf"" is also red. This aligns with the idea that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

5. Input: wif dax bluf | Output: red green green
   After ""dax"" which is green, ""bluf"" is green.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat or copy the color of the preceding word.",1.0,129,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the pattern and correspondence between the input and output to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's go through each example and observe:

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to a second ""red"" following ""wif.""

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""Bluf"" corresponds to a second ""yellow"" following ""zup.""

3. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   - ""Bluf"" corresponds to a second ""green"" following ""dax"" and a second ""yellow"" following ""zup.""

4. Input: lug wif bluf

   - ""Bluf"" corresponds to a second ""red"" following ""wif.""

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""Bluf"" corresponds to a second ""green"" following ""dax.""

From these observations, it seems ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to a repetition of the color directly preceding it. Therefore, ""bluf"" appears to function as a placeholder for ""repeat the previous color.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.",1.0,129,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following pattern:

1. Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the word that follows ""bluf"" is the color that ""bluf"" translates to in the output. This is evident because the color that follows in the output is duplicated.
2. The first example shows ""bluf lug"" translating to ""red blue,"" indicating ""bluf"" itself stands for ""red,"" and ""lug"" for ""blue.""
3. The second example strengthens this as ""bluf"" stands alone with ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" may not just mean ""red,"" but that it represents the color that immediately follows it when present in a pair.
4. However, the third example shows ""bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translating to ""green red yellow yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" again directly precedes ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue), reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the following word.
5. The fourth and fifth examples reaffirm this pattern, with ""bluf"" preceding ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green), respectively, and the corresponding outputs being ""red red"" and ""green green.""

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color meaning of the word that immediately follows it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning: bluf represents the color of the word that follows it.",0.9,129,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can infer a pattern where the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" except when preceded or followed by certain words, which causes it to change. Here is the pattern breakdown with the relevant rule:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" (in first and third examples), the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" (in the third and fifth examples), the output is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" (in the first and fourth examples), the output for ""bluf"" is ""red."" However, this is a bit inconclusive since ""bluf"" is always followed by ""wif"" in these examples.
- When ""bluf"" is not directly preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax"" (in the second example, where it stands alone), its output is ""yellow.""

From this analysis, the rule for what ""bluf"" means seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""red"" by default, but its color changes to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug,"" to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax,"" and to ""yellow"" when neither precedes it.",0.8,129,bluf
"Rule: bluf corresponds to the word ""red"" repeated as many times as the number of words after ""bluf"" until the next ""bluf"" or the end of the input sequence. For instance, if there is one word after ""bluf"" and before the next ""bluf"" or the end of the sequence, the output is one ""red"". If there are two words after ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"", and so on.

Evidence for Rule:
- ""wif bluf lug zup"": ""bluf"" is followed by two words, and the output is ""red red"".
- ""zup bluf"": ""bluf"" is at the end with no following words, and there is no ""red"" in the output.
- ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"": ""bluf"" is followed by two words (""wif zup""), so the output is ""green red red"". The second ""bluf"" has the output ""blue"" but no ""red"" since it is the last word.
- ""lug wif bluf"": ""bluf"" is followed by no words, and there is no ""red"" in the output.
- ""wif dax bluf"": ""bluf"" is followed by no words, and there is no ""red"" in the output.

bluf -> ""red"" repeated for the number of words that follow it until the next ""bluf"" or the end.",0.0,129,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to lead to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Let's break down the examples to observe the pattern:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Here, 'dax' corresponds to 'green'. Following 'walm', the color 'green' is repeated three times.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- In this case, 'wif' maps to 'red', and post 'walm', we again have 'red' repeated three times.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- In this sequence, the word before 'walm' is 'zup', which corresponds to 'yellow'. After 'walm', 'yellow' is repeated three times following which there is 'blue' that corresponds to the next word 'lug'.

Given there are no counterexamples where ""walm"" produces a different output, the rule seems consistent across the examples.

Rule: walm means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it three times. 

walm -> repeat the previous color three times",1.0,129,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" is connected to the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the prior word three times.

Here's the breakdown according to the examples:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" (dax is associated with green).
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" (wif is associated with red).
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" leads to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" (zup before ""walm"" is associated with yellow).

Hence, the rule I deduce is: 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,129,walm
"Considering the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the immediately preceding word. In each instance, the color related to the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times as output. Let's apply this pattern to the examples:

1. In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""walm"" leads to ""green green green"".
2. In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""walm"" leads to ""red red red"".
3. In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to blue.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,129,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the last non-walm word.

Explanation:
- dax walm -> green green green (dax is associated with green)
- wif walm -> red red red (wif is associated with red)
- lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> last non-walm before walm is zup, which is yellow, hence walm translates to yellow yellow yellow, and the last lug translates to blue.",1.0,129,walm
"Based on the examples provided where the input contains the nonce word 'walm' and the output consists of color repetitions, the rule for 'walm' appears to be as follows:

When 'walm' is in the input, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes 'walm'.

Let's verify this with the examples:

1. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   Here, 'dax' comes before 'walm' and corresponds to green in the output.

2. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red""
   Here, 'wif' precedes 'walm' and results in red being repeated in the output.

3. Input: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug""
   Output: ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   In this more complex example, 'zup' is the word before 'walm', corresponding to yellow in the output, which is repeated three times.

4. Other examples (4th and 5th) are repetitions of the first example, which confirm the established pattern.

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in a sequence.",1.0,130,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first analyze the patterns of input and output across all examples:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
2. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
3. Input: dax bluf lug wif | Output: green green blue red
4. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif | Output: blue green green yellow blue red
5. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf | Output: yellow red green red red

Looking at the examples, let's see if there's a pattern associated with each word:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Now, let's look specifically at ""bluf"":

- In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red green.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"" and the output is ""green blue.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is succeeded by ""zup"" and the output is ""green yellow.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is the last word and the output sequence ends with ""red.""

From the outputs immediately after ""bluf,"" we can see that it does not correspond to a consistent color. This means that ""bluf"" likely acts as a modifier or affects the sequence in a particular way, rather than translating to a single color. Observing that ""bluf"" is always followed by the color that would be associated with the word immediately following ""bluf,"" we can induce that ""bluf"" may mean ""repeat the next color"".

Let's check this rule:

- In example 1, after ""bluf,"" ""green"" repeats once.
- In example 2, after ""bluf,"" ""green"" repeats.
- In example 3, after ""bluf,"" ""blue"" does not repeat because ""wif"" should be ""red"" but looking at the entire sequence, it's plausible that ""bluf"" causes a shift in the sequence such that the color after ""bluf"" is placed before it causing ""dax"" -> ""green"" to appear before ""bluf"" as well.
- In example 4, after ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" repeats.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" does not have a word after it, but the last color ""red"" is repeated, which corresponds to ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, it makes sense that ""bluf"" causes the output color of the word following it to be duplicated, but in the case of example 3, it seems to also ""shift"" the output backwards in the sequence. Thus, ""bluf"" represents a rule that duplicates the output of the following word, with certain conditions allowing a shift in the sequence:

Rule: bluf -> causes the color of the next word to repeat or shifts the sequence to duplicate the color of the word following it.",0.8,130,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look at the patterns and associations of the word with the outputs provided. Here's what we can observe from each example:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green""
2. ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green""
3. ""dax bluf lug wif"" results in ""green green blue red""
4. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" results in ""blue green green yellow blue red""
5. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red green red red""

From these examples, the word that precedes ""bluf"" is associated with the same color that follows ""bluf."" This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat,"" as the color that follows ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word before it:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and following ""bluf,"" we have ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and is associated with ""green,"" which is repeated after ""bluf.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" again and the ""green"" repeats.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif"" is red, and ""red"" is repeated after ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. bluf means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""",0.8,130,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns relative to its appearance and the corresponding outputs:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red green...""
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green blue...""
3. When ""bluf"" is at the end after ""wif,"" the output ends with ""red red.""

These patterns suggest that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color output, but rather, its output is related to the word that precedes it. Comparing the inputs with the outputs, we can attempt to deduce the underlying rule.

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Now let's look at the color that follows ""bluf"" in the output:

- After ""wif bluf,"" we see ""green"" indicating that ""bluf"" might change the prior output's color to the next in a specific sequence.
- After ""dax bluf,"" we see ""blue,"" which follows the sequence of green to blue.

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule: ""bluf"" likely causes the subsequent color to increment to the next in a sequence of predefined colors. If we consider a sequence of (red, green, blue, yellow), then ""bluf"" seems to advance the color to the next in this sequence. 

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the context: 
Rule: ""bluf"" -> when seen in the input, it changes the prior word's corresponding output color to the next in the sequence of red, green, blue, and yellow (assuming the sequence wraps around to red after yellow).",0.8,130,bluf
"Based on the given examples, there seems to be a correlation between the word ""bluf"" and the color output, as well as the positions of ""bluf"" and the other words. Let's analyze the examples:

In the first two examples:
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
- ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""

In both cases, ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif"" and leads to the output ""red green"".

In the third example:
- ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red""

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and leads to ""green blue"".

In the fourth example:
- ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""

In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which followed ""lug"", and the sequence is ""green green yellow"".

Finally, in the last example:
- ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""

Here, ""bluf"" directly follows the second instance of ""wif"" resulting in ""red red"".

From the information above, we can induce that ""bluf"" seems to transform the color associated with the word just before it into red. However, we have an exception in the case of ""dax bluf lug"", where it resulted in ""green blue"" instead of the expected ""green red"". This could mean that when ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" there might be a different rule, or it could be an inconsistency in the rule.

Additionally, the order of the words might play a role as the word preceding ""bluf"" seems to affect the outcome. It seems that ""bluf"" needs the context of the preceding word to define the color output.

To consolidate the rules for ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it turns the output to ""red"".
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output may not necessarily be ""red"" indicating a possible context-dependent exception or a secondary rule.
3. The output ""green"" associated with ""dax"" changes when followed by ""bluf"", suggesting a rule that involves not only the presence of ""bluf"" but also its position relative to ""dax"".

Given the ambiguity and limited data, particularly with the ""dax bluf"" relationship, the best working rule I can provide at this point is:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it results in ""red"". The relationship between ""bluf"" and other words requires more examples for a clear rule induction.",0.7,130,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the position and output color of ""bluf"" within each given example. Let's compare each instance of ""bluf"" and its output:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
4. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
5. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red

Observations:

- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" (Examples 1, 2, and 5), the output color for ""bluf"" is red.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug"" (Example 3), the output color for ""bluf"" is blue.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""zup"" (Example 4), the output color for ""bluf"" is green.

So, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent:

- ""bluf"" takes the same color as a preceding ""wif"".
- ""bluf"" takes the color blue if it is between ""dax"" and ""lug"".
- ""bluf"" could take the color green if the next word after ""bluf"" is ""zup"".

However, we don't have enough examples to confirm a consistent pattern for the last point, as ""bluf"" is also red in Example 5 where it follows ""wif"", even though ""zup"" is in the sentence.

Thus, the rule identified with the given data is:

Rule: ""bluf"" adopts the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, with specific pairings to ""wif"" to generate red, and to ""dax"" with ""lug"" following to produce blue.

bluf -> meaning: Context-dependent color as determined by adjacent words, with identified patterns for ""wif"" as red and ""dax"" followed by ""lug"" as blue.",0.7,130,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that walm represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here are the instances that lead to this conclusion:

1. In ""dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" and the output ""green green green"" suggests that ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the word ""green"" that precedes it, before moving on to ""lug"" which correlates to ""blue.""
2. In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" and the output ""yellow yellow yellow"" supports that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" three times.
3. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and given the output ""green blue blue blue,"" it suggests that ""walm"" is repeating the color associated with ""lug.""
4. In ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" observing that ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" the sequence ""red red red"" is the output associated with ""walm.""
5. In ""lug walm zup wif,"" the ""blue blue blue"" sequence is noted after ""lug,"" and before the sequence changes color to ""yellow"" associated with ""zup,"" indicating again that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes prior to it (in this case, ""lug"").

From these observations, we can deduce the following:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,130,walm
"Examining the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce what the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to. Let’s analyze each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax walm lug → Output: green green green blue
2. Input: zup walm → Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: dax lug walm → Output: green blue blue blue
4. Input: lug wif zup wif walm → Output: blue red yellow red red red
5. Input: lug walm zup wif → Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Looking at the first example:
- ""dax"" leads to a ""green"" output.
- ""lug"" yields a ""blue"" output at the end, suggesting position sensitivity or a change in rule depending on position.

In the second example:
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" output.

In the third example:
- ""dax"" is still ""green,"" and ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" now resulting in ""blue blue,"" which indicates that ""walm"" might duplicate the color of the word that precedes it.

Moving to the fourth example, it becomes trickier:
- ""lug"" at the beginning is ""blue"".
- ""wif"" results in ""red"".
- ""zup"" here still translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" once again contributes ""red.""
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red,"" strengthening the theory that ""walm"" duplicates the color representation of the preceding word.

The fifth example further supports this idea:
- ""lug"" at the beginning is ""blue,"" and followed by ""walm,"" it leads to ""blue blue"".
- ""zup"" and ""wif"" yield their corresponding colors, ""yellow"" and ""red.""

Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color output of the preceding word.",0.9,130,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". We look for patterns that correlate with the occurrence of ""walm"" and the corresponding colors in the output.

Input: dax walm lug Output: green green green blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to the first green, ""lug"" at the end corresponds to blue.

Input: zup walm Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. There's no other word, so the repetitions may be influenced by ""walm""

Input: dax lug walm Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue and additional blues correspond to ""walm""

Input: lug wif zup wif walm Output: blue red yellow red red red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow. The extra reds are followed by ""walm"", indicating ""walm"" could be adding more of the preceding color.

Input: lug walm zup wif Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- Here, ""lug"" again is blue, and ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red. Given that walm follows ""lug"" and there are additional blues before yellow appears, it suggests ""walm"" repeats the previous color.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word right before ""walm"".

Thus, we can define the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> Causes a repetition of the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",0.8,130,walm
"Based on the usage of ""walm"" in the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" directly influences the color output in a specific way. Each time ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the color that precedes it repeats three times in the output, followed by an additional color.

Let's examine the patterns:

1. ""dax walm lug"" has the output of ""green green green blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes ""green"" (the color associated with ""dax"") to repeat three times, followed by ""blue"" (the color associated with ""lug"").

2. ""zup walm"" has the output of ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" (the color associated with ""zup"") repeat three times. There is no fourth color since ""walm"" is at the end of the input.

3. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" (the color associated with ""lug"") to repeat three times following the ""green"" for ""dax.""

4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red,"" where ""walm"" causes ""red"" (the color associated with ""wif"") to repeat three times after the sequence ""blue red yellow.""

5. ""lug walm zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow red,"" which again shows ""walm"" causing ""blue"" (the color associated with ""lug"") to repeat three times followed by ""yellow"" (from ""zup"").

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times in the output sequence, except when ""walm"" is at the end of the input, in which case the color just repeats three times without any following color. If there is a word that follows ""walm,"" the color associated with that following word is then appended to the output sequence.

walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times, followed by the color of the next word if there is one. If ""walm"" is the last word, there's no color following the triple repetition.",0.8,130,walm
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is altered by the preceding word or words. Here is the relevant information broken down:

1. ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue"" indicates that ""walm"" initially produced ""green"" but then changed the subsequent word to ""blue.""
2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it for itself and the following color, given there are no other words to alter the sequence.
3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" suggests that ""walm"" takes the last mentioned color (in this case ""blue"" from ""lug"") and applies it to itself multiple times, but it's not clear why it is not green from ""dax.""
4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red"" indicates again that ""walm"" is taking the color of the preceding word and repeating it.
5. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red"" shows ""walm"" repeating the color blue after ""lug"" and before the next words which are not affected by ""walm.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" has the following behavior:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word for itself multiple times or changes the following word color based on a pattern not clarified in the given examples.

However, there's insufficient data to determine the exact number of repeats or the rules that change the subsequent word's color. More examples would be needed to refine the rule for ""walm"" for subsequent words.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently results in the output of ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the word 'zup' appears in the input, it is replaced with the word 'yellow' in the output.",1.0,131,zup
"To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first look at the provided examples and their outputs in a structured manner:

1. `wif bluf` -> `red red`
2. `wif bluf dax walm` -> `red red green green green`
3. `dax bluf wif zup wif` -> `green green red yellow red`
4. `lug wif bluf` -> `blue red red`
5. `wif dax bluf` -> `red green green`

Let's analyze the pattern for ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" as in examples 1, 2, and 4, the output contains two ""red"" words after the corresponding ""wif"" colors. This may suggest that ""bluf"" repeats the color-word associated with the word in front of it.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output directly following ""dax"" contains two ""green"" words. This reinforces the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color-word associated with the word in front of it.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"", which aligns with the word ""green,"" and results in two consecutive ""green"" outputs in the output string.

By observing these examples, we can deduce the operative rule that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated. So, in terms of summarizing the rule,

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color-word associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,131,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> ""red"" and insert an extra ""red"" after the existing sequence.",1.0,131,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.,1.0,131,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" outputs two ""red"" when following another word. Let's examine the pattern:

- After ""wif"": wif bluf -> red red
- After ""dax"": dax bluf -> green green (in the context: wif bluf dax walm, ""dax walm"" adds two additional ""green"", so this is ignored as part of bluf's meaning)
- After ""wif"": wif bluf -> red red (in the context: dax bluf wif zup wif, ignore ""wif zup wif"" since they come after bluf)
- After ""lug"": lug wif bluf -> blue red red (ignore the first blue as it precedes wif)
- After ""wif"" and ""dax"": wif dax bluf -> red green green (ignore the first red green as they correspond to wif dax)

Considering the repetitions of ""red"" that immediately follow ""bluf"" and the fact that ""bluf"" does not have a standalone translation but is influenced by the preceding word, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, twice.",0.8,131,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red (repeated for the number of words preceding ""bluf"")",0.8,131,bluf
"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that the first word represents. Each time the word ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color tied to the word prior to ""walm"". 

For example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Similarly, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates a repetition of three of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,131,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to replicate the color word that comes before it three times. Here are the observations:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow"" three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue"" three times.
- In the case of ""lug dax walm wif"", ""dax"" is directly in front of ""walm"", and the output for ""dax"" is ""green"" repeated three times, followed by ""red"" for ""wif"".

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color word that immediately precedes ""walm"" three times.

Rule: If a color word is immediately followed by ""walm"", the corresponding color word is produced three times in the output.",1.0,131,walm
"walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.

Rule: ""walm"" signals that the color word before it should be repeated three times in the output. If there is another color word after ""walm"", it does not seem to affect the repetition count of the preceding color, as seen in ""lug dax walm wif"" which outputs ""blue green green green red,"" indicating that ""walm"" caused ""green"" to be repeated three times, with ""wif"" likely indicating a single instance of ""red.""",1.0,131,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, it causes the output to repeat that color the same number of times as there are letters in the word preceding ""walm"". For example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and has three letters. Similarly, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and contains three letters.",1.0,131,walm
"Based on the repetition of colors in the output corresponding to a single occurrence of the nonce word 'walm' in the input, the most likely rule is that 'walm' causes the repetition of the preceding color word. Therefore, if 'zup' stands for 'yellow', then 'zup walm' would yield 'yellow yellow yellow'. Likewise, if 'lug' stands for 'blue', 'lug walm' would produce 'blue blue blue'. The third example, 'lug dax walm wif', is consistent with the idea that 'dax' represents 'green' and 'wif' represents 'red', causing 'walm' to repeat the color 'green' three times before it's followed by 'red' corresponding to 'wif'.

"Analyzing the input and output pairs provided, it is apparent that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. However, the color that each word corresponds to is not consistent across all examples, which suggests that the meaning of ""dax"" does not correspond to a single color. Instead, it seems that ""dax"" might represent a rule or condition regarding how colors are assigned. Let's examine the occurrences of ""dax"":

1. Input: zup bluf dax - Output: yellow yellow green
   - ""dax"" is at the end and outputs green.
   
2. Input: dax wif lug - Output: green red blue
   - ""dax"" is at the beginning and outputs green.

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm - Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: dax zup wif - Output: green yellow red
   - ""dax"" is at the beginning and outputs green.

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf - Output: green green green red red
   - ""dax"" is at the beginning and outputs green.

In every example, the occurrence of ""dax"" correlates with the color green. However, its position in the input sequence does not seem to affect this output color. Thus, we can deduce that the rule for ""dax"" is that it corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore: dax -> green. Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is green.",1.0,132,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the output at the same position. Here is the rule based on the examples given:

In every input example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. It always translates to green, and there does not appear to be any dependency on the surrounding words.

Therefore, ""dax"" means green.",1.0,132,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can identify a pattern for what 'dax' means. In each case, where the word 'dax' appears, the output is 'green'. Furthermore, the appearance of 'dax' does not seem to depend on its position within the input string – it consistently translates to 'green' regardless of whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the output.",1.0,132,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every instance. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" represents the color yellow.",1.0,132,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" in the output. The rule can be determined as follows:

When ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (except in the presence of ""zup"", where ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""yellow""). ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"". We know this because when ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output in the same relative position. 

The rule seems consistent regardless of what other words ""zup"" appears with:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to the third ""yellow,"" which follows ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" suggesting ""lug"" and ""bluf"" might coincide with ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, and ""wif"" with ""red"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and follows ""dax,"" where ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" and ""bluf"" for ""green"" suggesting ""dax"" and ""bluf"" may both represent ""green"". Yet, ""zup"" once again corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the third and fourth examples, ""zup"" appears with ""wif"" and ""lug,"" respectively, and once more ""zup"" equates to ""yellow"" while ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspond to their respective colors, ""red"" and ""blue"".
- In the final example, ""walm"" is a new word not seen in the previous inputs, but given that the output for this input is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""zup"" has consistently corresponded with ""yellow,"" it's reasonable to deduce that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".

Thus, the rule is that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of context:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,132,zup
"Rule: bluf corresponds to the color ""red"" when following the word ""wif""; otherwise, bluf corresponds to the color ""green"".",1.0,132,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided, let's deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif"" or is in between them, we see the output ""red"" (examples 1, 3, and 5).
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" directly, as in example 2, the output is ""green"".
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or is preceded by ""zup lug"", the output is ""blue"" (examples 3 and 4).

Given these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color based on its proximity to other words. Specifically:

- After ""dax"" directly, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".
- After ""lug"" or when coupled with ""zup lug"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- When positioned next to or after ""wif"", or between ""dax"" and ""wif"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

However, this pattern is inconsistent in the case of example 4, where the output is ""blue"" instead of ""green"" or ""red"" when ""bluf"" is after ""dax zup lug"". This might be due to the influence of ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"" which seems to be strong enough to change its output to ""blue"" regardless of ""dax"" appearing earlier in the sequence.

With the information available and the patterns observed, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on a color related to its adjacent words, with a priority for the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning depends on the preceding word: after ""dax"" it means ""green"", after ""lug"" or with ""zup lug"" it means ""blue"", and after ""wif"" or between ""dax"" and ""wif"" it means ""red"". If ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup lug"", it defaults to blue, which suggests that ""lug"" has the strongest influence on ""bluf"".",0.8,132,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like the word ""bluf"" induces the color red to whatever word precedes it, while maintaining its own color representation when occurring individually. However, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it transforms to the color blue.

- The first example shows ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" thus ""bluf"" is red when following ""wif"".
- The second example has ""bluf"" by itself, producing the output green, suggesting when ""bluf"" stands alone, it means green.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, giving ""red,"" and is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue.""
- The fourth example shows that ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" implying ""bluf"" takes on the color blue after ""lug.""
- The fifth example also shows ""wif bluf"" translating to ""red red.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning. 
- When ""bluf"" stands alone, it means green.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it translates to red.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it translates to blue.
- Apart from these, ""bluf"" has not been shown to change meaning with any other words, so additional occurrences would be needed to derive further rules.",0.8,132,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will examine the corresponding outputs for each input containing ""bluf"" and look for patterns:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red.""
2. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
3. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red blue green.""
4. ""dax zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue blue.""
5. ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red.""

Now, let's try to find a rule that connects ""bluf"" to its outputs:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" 
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is also ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" is in between two words, as in ""dax bluf"" or ""lug wif bluf,"" its output matches the color of the word following ""bluf.""

From these observations, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color indicated by the word that follows it:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the following word. If there is no word following ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is green by default.",0.8,132,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: Walm means to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.,1.0,132,walm
"Walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is used after a color word, it indicates that the color of the previous word should be repeated in sequence for a certain number of times. The specific number of repetitions appears to be thrice based on the given examples.",1.0,132,walm
"From inspecting the examples provided, each time the word ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Here's how ""walm"" operates in each instance:

- zup walm lug zup wif dax -> ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" after ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" repeated thrice before the pattern changes with the next word ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- wif walm lug bluf -> ""wif"" is ""red,"" after ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated twice. The next word ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue,"" which is then repeated because of ""bluf.""
- lug zup walm lug -> ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated two times, until ""lug"" changes it to ""blue.""
- dax walm -> ""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated twice.
- lug walm -> ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated twice.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output color of the word just before it to be repeated multiple times (the number of times equals to the output colors after ""walm"" before a new color appears). However, it is important to note that the number of repetitions is not consistent across examples, which could imply additional contextual rules not clearly defined by the provided examples.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated in the output. The exact number of repetitions may depend on context not provided in the examples.",1.0,132,walm
"Based on the examples given, it appears that when the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is a series of identical colors that corresponds to the color of the word preceding ""walm.""

Looking at each of the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" -> Output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", with ""zup"" outputting ""yellow."" Thus, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color represented by ""zup.""

2. ""wif walm"" -> Output is ""red red red"", with ""wif"" outputting ""red."" Hence, ""walm"" repeats the color represented by ""wif.""

3. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> The output after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow,"" same as ""zup."" Although ""lug"" appears after ""zup walm,"" it does not seem to affect the rule.

4. ""dax walm"" -> Output is ""green green green,"" with ""dax"" outputting ""green."" So ""walm"" repeats the color represented by ""dax.""

5. ""lug walm"" -> Output is ""blue blue blue,"" with ""lug"" outputting ""blue."" Thus, ""walm"" repeats the color represented by ""lug.""

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""walm"" to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""bluf"" duplicates the color word immediately before it, ""red"", producing ""red red.""

3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and with no color word immediately before ""bluf"", it duplicates the last mentioned color, ""yellow"", producing ""yellow yellow.""

4. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""walm"" to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" duplicates ""red"", resulting in ""red red.""

5. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" repeats as ""red"" again. ""Bluf"" duplicates the preceding ""red"", resulting in ""red red.""

Rule:
bluf -> duplicates the color word that comes immediately before it in the output sequence. If there is no color word immediately before it, duplicates the last mentioned color.",1.0,133,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a duplication of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Let's look at each input and output pairing to illustrate this:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
In this case, ""wif"" gives the output ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes the word ""red"" to be repeated.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" ""walm"" gives ""yellow,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates the red to give ""red red.""

3. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" makes it ""yellow yellow"" by duplication.

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
""dax"" gives ""green,"" ""walm"" gives another ""green,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates it to give ""red red.""

5. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red
""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""dax"" gives ""green,"" ""wif"" again gives ""red,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates the last color mentioned which is the second instance of ""red.""

If the preceding word translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red red,"" if it's ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" and so on. It seems that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" may correspond to ""blue"" but since it never directly precedes ""bluf"", the rule is not definitive for ""walm.""

So, bluf -> repetition of the previous color name.",1.0,133,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repetition of the color word that corresponds to the previous word.,1.0,133,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it outputs two consecutive colors that are the same as the color following the last word that was mentioned before ""walm"".

Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue green blue blue blue"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", thus ""walm"" results in ""blue blue"".

2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", thus ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow"".

3. ""wif walm lug bluf"" outputs ""red red red blue blue"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", thus ""walm"" results in ""red red"".

4. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" outputs ""red red green green red red red blue red"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", so ""walm"" results in ""red red"".

5. ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", thus ""walm"" results in ""red red"".

Rule: walm -> Outputs the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeated once.",1.0,133,walm
"Based on the examples provided, where the output seems to depend on the word preceding ""walm"", the rule for the word ""walm"" can be induced as follows:

When ""walm"" appears, the output repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" twice more. So if the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" and the color for ""dax"" is ""green"", the output after ""walm"" will be ""green green"".

Therefore, the rule is: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word two more times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color twice.",1.0,133,walm
"Observing the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the word ""walm"" is followed by an output that is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it, however one additional repetition occurs. This yields three repetitions of the same color. The rules for other words seem to be as follows:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> no direct output (it seems to alter the rule of ""walm"" which follows)

Now, let's apply these rules to the given inputs:

1. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output should be: green blue green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) three times.

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output should be: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output should be: red red red blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) three times, followed by ""lug"" which is blue, and then ""bluf"" seems to insert an additional blue with no direct association to a color.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output should be: red red green green red red red blue red
   Analysis: ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to three repetitions of red.

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output should be: green red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) three times.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" output ""green"" three times. If the word before is ""lug,"" output ""blue"" three times. If it is ""wif,"" output ""red"" three times. If it is ""zup,"" output ""yellow"" three times. ""Bluf"" seems to have no effect on the output pattern but may influence a pattern if it directly precedes ""walm"" which is not evidenced by the examples provided.",1.0,133,walm
"From the examples provided, we can observe a pattern for the nonce word ""walm."" In all instances, the color that follows the word ""walm"" is repeated an additional two times. The initial color that ""walm"" translates to seems to be dependent on the last color word before ""walm."" Here is the breakdown:

1. In the first line, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
2. In the second line, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In the third line, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, resulting in ""red red red.""
4. In the fourth line, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red once again, hence ""red red red.""
5. In the fifth line, ""walm"" directly follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so the output is ""red red red.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that precedes ""walm"" three times.",1.0,133,walm
"Based on the given examples, it is possible to deduce a pattern associated with the nonce word ""walm."" Each time the word ""walm"" appears, the color that comes immediately before ""walm"" in the input is repeated two more times in the output. Let's examine the examples in detail:

1. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color blue (associated with ""lug"") is repeated two extra times after it appears.

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - In this case, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and the color yellow (corresponding to ""zup"") is duplicated two more times.

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - ""Wif"" is before ""walm"" and red is outputted two additional times.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - Here, the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" hence red is repeated two more times.

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - Similarly, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" so red is shown two additional times.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the input sequence, it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be outputted two additional times.

Therefore:

walm -> The color of the word before ""walm"" in the input is output twice more in the output.",1.0,133,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is input, the output is always ""blue,"" regardless of the position or combination with other words.",1.0,134,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,134,lug
"lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug means blue.",1.0,134,lug

"lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.",1.0,134,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Notice that in every input, the word ""dax"" is present, and in each output, the word ""green"" is also present. Thus, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.",1.0,134,dax
"Analyzing the given inputs and their corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we can consider each instance where ""dax"" appears and what output is associated with it.

Here are the instances where ""dax"" appears:

1. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
2. lug dax -> blue green
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
5. wif walm dax -> red red red green

From these examples, it's clear that whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" Other words in the inputs appear to map to different colors consistently (e.g., ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""red""), but ""dax"" always maps to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,134,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we'll look at the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""dax"" appears:

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

By examining the outputs, it's noticeable that wherever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" follows in the output. The position of ""dax"" in the input doesn't affect its corresponding output color. It's the same color regardless of the other words around it. This consistency allows us to determine the meaning of ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,134,dax
"Based on the examples given, it seems that certain words are consistently being translated to certain colors. Here are the observed mappings from the examples:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""bluf"" -> green (in the first and third examples) / yellow (in the fourth example)
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" apparently equals ""wif"" -> red

Now let's look specifically at the occurrences of ""dax"":

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is surrounded by different colors (red and yellow), and it translates to green.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" is after ""lug"" (blue) and translates to green.
3. In the third example, ""dax"" is in front of ""zup"" (yellow) and translates to green.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue) and it translates to green.
5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" (red) and translates to green.

From these examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to green, regardless of the words that come before or after it in the examples provided. The meaning of ""bluf"" appears inconsistent but with the given data, and no additional information on the context or rules, ""bluf"" could potentially alter meanings based on context or be a mistake in the examples. For the purpose of this induction, we will not try to solve for ""bluf"".

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,134,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output color ""green"" is present in the corresponding position.",1.0,134,dax
"Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,134,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", let's examine its consistent presence across different examples and the corresponding outputs in the same position.

In the Output column, every instance of ""red"" corresponds to an instance of ""wif"" in the Input:

1. lug zup wif -> blue yellow red
2. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
3. dax wif -> green red
4. walm wif -> yellow red
5. wif bluf -> red red

From these correlations, it appears that ""wif"" is not conditional on the word preceding it, as it follows various different words (""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and also stands alone as in the last example). The word ""wif"" always results in ""red"" no matter the context.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each example considering that every ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a specific color or pattern in the output.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, both ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could mean ""the same color as the preceding word.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again seems to correspond to the same color as the preceding word, in this case, ""blue.""

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

In this series, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" again takes the color of ""lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The second ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" represents the same color as the preceding word.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The ""walm"" here corresponds to ""green,"" the same color as ""dax,"" followed by ""lug,"" which also corresponds to ""green.""

This seems to confirm our pattern: ""walm"" represents the same color as the preceding word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> the same color as the preceding word.",1.0,134,walm
"Examining the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output associated with it. Instead, the color output for ""walm"" appears to depend on the word that directly precedes it in the input. Let's look at the examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup  
   Output: red red red green yellow  
   Rule: The word after ""wif"" and ""walm"" is ""red.""

2. Input: zup walm  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow  
   Rule: The word after ""zup"" and ""walm"" is ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax lug walm  
   Output: green blue blue blue  
   Rule: The word after ""lug"" and ""walm"" is ""blue.""

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm  
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue  
   Rule: The words after ""lug"" and ""walm"" are ""blue,"" and the word after ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug  
   Output: yellow red green green green blue  
   Rule: The word after ""dax"" and ""walm"" is ""green.""

From these examples, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" takes on the color output corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. The output for ""walm"" is not a specific color but instead a repetition in output color of the word that comes right before it in the string.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""",1.0,134,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can try to figure out what the nonce word ""walm"" means by looking at the patterns before and after the word ""walm"" and its corresponding outputs:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
5. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue

Let's break down the pattern for each word:

- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue""

Now let's look at the outputs directly associated with ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is red and the next color changes from ""green"" (dax) to red as well.
- When ""walm"" is the only word after ""zup"", the output remains yellow consistent with ""zup.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the next color changes from ""yellow"" (dax in example 3, zup in example 4) to blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is before ""lug"", both ""dax"" and ""lug"" turn into green, a pattern seen in example 5.

From these observations, we can create the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the color of itself to the color of the word right before it and makes the following sequence of colors, if any, switch to the same color until a different word appears.

So, based on this rule:

walm -> meaning: walm makes itself and the following sequence of words (until a different word appears) take on the color of the word that precedes it.

For example, in ""dax lug walm"", ""walm"" would turn blue, the color of ""lug"", and make following ""lug"" blue too, resulting in ""green blue blue blue.""",0.8,134,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs in sequence:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" and ""red red red green yellow"" suggests ""walm"" has something to do with red since it follows a ""wif"" which also translates to red.

2. ""zup walm"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" indicates that ""walm"" leads to yellow when it follows ""zup.""

3. ""dax lug walm"" and ""green blue blue blue"" shows that after ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in multiple blues.

4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" and ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"" supports the conclusion that ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in blue(s), and ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in yellow.

5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" and ""yellow red green green green blue"" demonstrates that ""walm"" can lead to green when preceded by ""dax.""

By analyzing the patterns in these examples, we can observe that ""walm"" changes its output color based on the word that comes immediately before it. Here is the rule based on the given examples:

- When preceded by ""wif,"" the output color is red.
- When preceded by ""zup,"" the output color is yellow.
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output color transforms to green.
- When preceded by ""lug,"" the output color is consistently blue, which might indicate a repetition of the color blue multiple times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding word's corresponding output color; after ""lug,"" the output color blue is repeated.",0.8,134,walm
"To figure out the rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm | Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug | Output: yellow red green green green blue

Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can notice that the color following the word ""walm"" is always a repetition of the previous color, except when ""walm"" is the last word in the input sequence. In that case, the color for ""walm"" does not repeat the previous color.

Let's go through the inputs one by one:

1. The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" So, after ""walm,"" we see ""red"" again.
2. The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" So after ""walm,"" we get ""yellow"" again.
3. The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue."" So, after ""walm,"" we get ""blue"" again.
4. There are two instances of ""walm"" here. The first is preceded by ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" so ""walm"" is followed by ""blue."" The second ""walm"" is at the end of the input without any words after it, breaking the pattern we've seen so far.
5. The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" So after ""walm,"" we get ""green.""
   
However, we notice an exception in the fourth line, where the second ""walm"" is the last word of the sequence and yet the pattern holds, it is followed by ""blue"" which is the color for ""lug"" that comes before it. But since there is no color mentioned after the second ""walm"" in the output, we can't be sure of a pattern when ""walm"" is the last word. Let's infer the rule excluding the case when ""walm"" is at the end:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output color for ""walm"" repeats the output color of the word that comes immediately before it. 

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color.",0.8,134,walm

- The number of times ""red"" appears in the output corresponds to the position of ""wif"" in the input sentence:
  - When ""wif"" is the only input, there is one ""red"".
  - When ""wif"" is the first word in a two-word input, there are two ""reds"" in the output.
  - When ""wif"" is in the middle of a three-word input, there are three ""reds"" in the output, and so on.

The pattern suggests that the word ""wif"" correlates with the term ""red"" in the output, and it also implies the number of ""red"" in the output—equal to the number of words in the input, including ""wif"" itself.

Rule: wif -> red

The number of instances of ""red"" in the output is equal to the number of words in the input that includes ""wif.""",0.9,135,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,135,zup
"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,135,zup
"zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all examples.",1.0,135,zup
"To induce the rule for the meaning of the word ""zup,"" let's look at the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup
   Output: yellow

From this, we can see that ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

In this example, when ""zup"" is repeated after some words, it translates to ""yellow"" both times, while ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""lug"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""blue"". It seems that the presence of ""zup"" doesn't affect the translation of the other words.

3. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

This time, ""lug"" is at the end and translates to ""blue"" while ""walm"" is now producing ""yellow"". This is different from the previous case where ""walm"" was preceded by other words and translated to ""blue"".

4. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

Here, ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"", consistent with the first provided example.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Given the example, ""walm"" alone after ""zup"" generates a series of ""yellow"" with no hint of ""blue"", unlike in the second example where it followed other words and was translated to ""blue"".

Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to have a consistent translation to ""yellow"". However, it seems to affect the translations of the words that follow it. Specifically, when ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"" repeating the color tied to ""zup"" itself, regardless of how the word ""walm"" translates in other contexts.

Rule: ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". When followed by ""walm"", it causes ""walm"" to also translate to ""yellow"" rather than ""blue"", creating a repetition of ""yellow"". Other words retain their individual translations following ""zup"" (e.g., ""dax""->""green"", ""lug""->""blue""), unless they are ""walm"" which is influenced to repeat ""zup""'s ""yellow"".",0.9,135,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's first look at the outputs to see if there are any consistent patterns.

When the input is only ""zup"":
- zup -> yellow

When ""zup"" is at both the beginning and the end:
- zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Here, the presence of ""zup"" both at the beginning and the end results in ""yellow"" at both corresponding positions, while other words correspond to different colors.

When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"":
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Every instance of ""walm"" directly after ""zup"" results in the output ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might be contextually dependent on the presence of ""zup.""

Let's also look at inputs not ending or starting with ""zup"":

- zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
- zup dax -> yellow green

We don't see ""yellow"" succeeding ""zup"" in these cases unless ""walm"" is directly after ""zup,"" suggesting that the presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" is significant.

Taking these observations into account, and considering the repetition of ""yellow"" following ""zup,"" it's possible that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" or triggers the translation of subsequent words to ""yellow"" until a different rule applies (such as a new word like ""dax"" or ""lug,"" which presumably correspond to ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively).

However, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it seems to imply a continuation of ""yellow"" without change, which suggests ""walm"" has no effect or reiterates the ""yellowness"" when it directly follows ""zup.""

So the rule might be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and can cause the subsequent words to also translate to ""yellow"" until a new word with a different translation appears, except when “walm” directly follows “zup,” it results in a repetition of “yellow” without change.",0.9,135,zup
"To determine the meaning of the word ""bluf"", we should examine the patterns before and after ""bluf"" in each example and compare them to their corresponding outputs:

1. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
4. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
5. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue

Looking at the input-output pairs:

- In example 1, ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue"" and ""bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue."" However, we need to attribute the correct color to ""lug"" and ""zup"" to isolate ""bluf.""
- In example 2, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"" suggesting that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color ""green."" 
- In example 3, the pattern ""zup lug bluf"" maps to ""yellow blue blue,"" from which we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" since ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" 
- In example 4, ""lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" following ""dax.""
- Lastly, in example 5, ""dax lug bluf"" maps to ""green blue blue,"" which again suggests ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

From these comparisons, we can deduce a clear pattern where ""bluf"" represents the color of whatever word came immediately before it. This can be seen in examples 3, 4, and 5.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",1.0,135,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to represent the color that precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output is repeated. Here are the associations:

- In ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"", where ""yellow"" is repeated before the pattern continues.
- In ""dax bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The output is ""green green"", indicating ""bluf"" results in repeating the ""green"".
- In ""zup lug bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The output is ""yellow blue blue"", where ""blue"" is repeated after ""lug"".
- In ""lug dax bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The output is ""blue green green"", with ""green"" repeated.
- In ""dax lug bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The output is ""green blue blue"", again with ""blue"" repeated after ""lug"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" causes the color word preceding it to repeat in the output.",1.0,135,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is immediately preceding it. For example:

- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", thus ""bluf"" also means ""green"".
- In ""zup lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", hence ""bluf"" means ""blue"".
- In ""lug dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" means ""green"".
- In ""dax lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", therefore ""bluf"" means ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the immediately preceding word.",1.0,135,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following associations:

- zup = yellow
- lug = blue
- dax = green

In each case, the nonce word ""bluf"" directly follows another word, and the corresponding color output is a repetition of the color that was defined by the word that immediately precedes ""bluf."" Thus, we can induce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> repeating the color indicated by the word that comes directly before ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf means repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,135,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""blue."" Every time the word ""bluf"" appears in an input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",0.6,135,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that walm is a command that instructs us to repeat the color associated with the previous word. Let us examine how this applies to the examples:

Example 1:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green
Here, 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' and walm leads to two additional 'green's, implying that walm means ""repeat the previous color twice.""

Example 2:
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
- Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Here, the last word is 'wif,' which corresponds to 'red,' before walm is used. The output is 'red red red,' aligning with ""repeat the previous color twice.""

Example 3:
- Input: dax lug walm
- Output: green blue blue blue
In this example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' and is followed by walm, resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" once more suggesting that walm means ""repeat the previous color twice.""

Example 4:
Same as above, reinforcing the same rule.

Example 5:
- Input: lug dax walm
- Output: blue green green green
Here, 'dax' is the word before walm and corresponds to 'green.' The output is ""green green green,"" meaning that walm requires us to repeat the previous color twice.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color twice.",1.0,135,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to trigger a repetition of the output associated with the word immediately preceding it. In each example, the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" so the output after ""wif"" is ""red red red.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" making the output ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" and since ""dax"" is ""green,"" the output is ""green green green.""",1.0,135,walm
"Observing the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. After the word ""dax,"" the next word is translated into ""green.""
2. After the word ""wif,"" the next word is translated into ""red.""
3. After the word ""lug,"" the next word is translated into ""blue.""
4. The word ""walm"" is consistently translated into three repetitions of the color that precedes it.

From these observations, we can extract the following rule:

walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" is that the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times. 

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, then the output is the color associated with that word repeated three times.",1.0,135,walm

"To figure out the rule for the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and output patterns:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- The word ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the output is three ""green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to one ""green.""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- The word ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence of other words. Each word before ""walm"" has a corresponding color: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"". There is an additional ""red"" for the second ""wif"" and then three ""red"" corresponding to ""walm.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue), and the output is one ""green"" followed by three ""blue."" It seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it and repeats it three times.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- This input is the same as the previous one, with the same output, further suggesting that the rule relating to ""walm"" is maintained.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- In this case, ""walm"" is again taking on the color of the word immediately before it, which is ""dax,"" and the output color is ""green"" repeated three times.

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" means that we repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- ""wif dax wif"" translates to ""red green red"", so ""dax"" is flanked by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green"", with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".
- ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green"", which indicates that ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""dax"" is followed by two ""walm"" which both correspond to ""green"".
- ""dax"" alone translates to ""green"", reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"", where ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" following ""lug"" after a ""dax"" is also ""blue"".

- In strings with multiple instances of ""wif,"" each occurrence translates to ""red"" in the output.

- In the first example, ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green,"" which allows us to deduce that ""lug"" means blue and ""dax"" means green while ""wif"" stands for red. 
- The second input ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue,"" further supporting ""wif"" as red and ""lug"" as blue.
- The third input is simply ""wif,"" with the output being ""red."" This solidifies that ""wif"" itself directly means red.
- In the fourth example, the word ""wif"" appears twice and results in ""red"" each time, while ""dax"" is once again green, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color ""red.""
- Lastly, in the example ""zup wif walm,"" the appearance of ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, then ""wif"" to red, followed by ""walm,"" which seems to repeat the color red three times, though ""walm"" is not consistent across examples for a solid rule to be deduced.

- The two instances of ""walm"" in ""zup lug walm wif walm"" yield ""blue blue blue"" and ""red red red"" respectively
- ""dax walm"" within the input ""zup wif dax walm lug"" yields ""green green green""

Given this pattern, it may be concluded that ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be output in triplet form.

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""walm"" following ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"". This means ""walm"" after ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" also being repeated three times.
- It's a bit more complicated with ""lug zup walm lug"" because ""lug"" does not directly precede ""walm"" and it's preceded by a different color than its output. However, ""walm"" still results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times, probably because ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" here too, suggesting ""lug"" by itself translates to ""blue"".
- In ""zup lug walm wif walm"", ""walm"" first follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", but then it follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red"". This suggests that after ""lug"", ""walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated three times, and after ""wif"", it results in ""red"" repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it translates into the color word associated with the preceding word, repeated three times. So:

3. In a longer sequence, such as ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" maintains the pattern of three repetitions related to the word that appears immediately before it; hence ""zup walm"" again results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and the ""lug"" entries before and after the sequence are translated as single ""blue.""
4. When ""walm"" appears twice as in ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" the pattern of repeating the color related to the immediate preceding word three times persists; ""wif walm"" translates into ""red red red.""
5. The sequence ""zup wif dax walm lug"" shows that regardless of how many words come before ""walm,"" it is the immediate preceding word that determines the triplet color; ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow' in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,137,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input containing ""bluf"" and their corresponding output:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is present, the output is ""red"" immediately following its position.

Based on the examples:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
3. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
4. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
5. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green

In all cases, the word immediately following ""bluf"" is translated as ""red"" in the output. Hence, we can conclude:

bluf -> rule: The word ""bluf"" dictates that the word following it should be translated to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,137,bluf
"Based on the given examples, each word corresponds to a specific color when translated to the outputs. Examining the consistent patterns, we can see that ""bluf"" always translates to the color ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce the following:

- The word ""bluf"" is independent of its position in the sentence, meaning its position does not affect the output ('red').

From these observations, we can induce that the rule governing the word ""bluf"" is that it translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> red.",1.0,137,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color red. This is evident from the fact that every time the word ""bluf"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" is in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,137,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the input-output pairs provided:

1. When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
2. When ""lug"" appears, the output includes ""blue.""
3. When ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green.""
4. The word ""walm"" results in repetition; it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated.

Looking at the provided examples:

- In the first and second instances, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" is causing the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times.
- In the third instance, ""lug dax walm wif"" gives us ""blue green green green red."" Since ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" the ""walm"" here is causing the color associated with ""dax"" to be repeated.
- In the fourth instance, ""zup walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" implying that ""walm"" caused the triplet of ""yellow"" before ""dax"" changed the color to ""green"" and ""lug"" subsequently changed it to ""blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth instance, ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green,"" showing us that ""walm"" again repeated the ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" before ""dax"" changed it to ""green.""

Considering these observations, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,137,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided inputs and outputs.

- In the first and second examples, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" might mean ""yellow"" or ""repeat previous color."" However, we have only one color before ""walm.""

- In the third example, ""lug dax walm wif"" results in ""blue green green green red."" Here, ""lug"" turns into ""blue,"" ""dax"" turns into ""green,"" ""walm"" is followed by another ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" Following the logic from the first example, it seems as if ""walm"" repeated the color that came before it, ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Aligning with the first example, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats it twice. ""Dax"" is green again, and ""lug"" is blue.

- In the final example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice, and then ""dax"" is green as previously established.

From these examples, it's consistent that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that comes before it. 

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output of the previous word.",1.0,137,walm
"By examining the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""walm"" appears, the rule appears to be:

walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. If the word before ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" causes the output to be ""yellow"" as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned; if the word before ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" then ""walm"" causes the output to be ""blue"" as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned, and so on.",1.0,137,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output colors in a specific way. To deduce the rule, let's look closely at instances where ""walm"" is used:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and the repetition of ""yellow"" corresponds with the occurrence of ""walm.""

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Noticing the output, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that came just before it which is ""green.""

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""dax"" in ""green,"" and ""lug"" in ""blue."" ""walm"" again repeats the color that precedes it, which is ""yellow.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" ""dax"" yields ""green."" ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"" from before.

In all examples, the presence of ""walm"" repeats the color that is mentioned immediately before it. It's not affected by any word that follows it, only by the one that precedes it. Therefore, ""walm"" appears to copy the output color of the word right before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output of the preceding word.",1.0,137,walm
"From the examples provided, let's first list the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red
4. Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green

Now, let's analyze the patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is three times ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug dax,"" the outputs are two additional ""green"" before varying with ""red.""
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" followed by ""dax"" results in ""blue"" before ""walm"" and twice ""green"" after ""walm.""

Since ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" consistently map to ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow"" respectively - before or after the occurrence of ""walm,"" it seems like ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that came just before it, for a number of times equal to how many times that preceding color word has appeared.

Breaking it down:
- ""zup"" appears once before ""walm,"" so ""yellow"" (the color associated with ""zup"") is repeated thrice (first example).
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" is directly after ""lug,"" there are two ""blue"" outputs following. (last example)
- In the third example, ""lug"" occurs once and ""dax"" twice before ""walm"" so after ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" we see ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") twice.

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output contains the color green corresponding to its position.",1.0,138,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following correlations between the input nonce words and the output colors:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears as the first color in the output sequence.
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""walm"" correlates with a series of ""red,"" possibly signifying repetition or emphasis of the ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

The word ""bluf"" appears in one of the inputs without a directly corresponding color in the output, however, given the consistency of other words, we can surmise that ""bluf"" also correlates with ""blue,"" given the proximity and repetition of the color in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule we can derive for the meaning of ""dax"" could be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green

- In example 2, ""dax wif,"" the presence of 'dax' leads to the output ""green red.""

- In example 4, ""wif bluf lug dax wif,"" the output corresponding to 'dax' is ""green.""
- In example 5, ""lug dax,"" 'dax' follows 'lug,' and the output sequence is ""blue green.""

From these examples, one can induce that regardless of its position or the context, 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green.'

- ""wif"" changes the color output to ""red.""
- ""dax"" changes the color output to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color green.

Therefore, ""zup"" on its own always results in ""yellow,"" while other words influence or repeat the color output in a sequence.",1.0,138,zup
"Based on the given examples, here is the inferred rule:

- The word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green."" The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" causes it to repeat.
- In the third example, ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green green yellow green."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) and results in another occurrence of green.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif bluf zup"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" (corresponding to red) and duplicates the color.

bluf -> causes the preceding color word's color to be repeated.

Let's break down each input-output pair to see the pattern:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
There's only ""zup"" before ""walm,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
Here, ""dax"" before ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" there's ""zup"" which is ""yellow."" Thus, ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times until a new color (""yellow"") appears.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
""Dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" occurs before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, followed by ""zup"" and ""lug,"" which are ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Here, ""dax"" before ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times until a new color, ""yellow"" from ""zup,"" appears, followed by ""red"" from ""wif.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and since there's no color after ""walm,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

So the rule induction for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color mentioned before ""walm"" until a new color is mentioned. If no new color follows, repeat the previous color three times.",1.0,138,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it three times. The examples show the color word that precedes ""walm"" being repeated three times in the output:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern of colors in the outputs corresponding to its presence in the inputs.

Looking at the first example:

For the second example:
Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"", and after ""walm"" we have two ""green"" followed by a ""yellow"" from ""zup"".

In the third example:
Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
- ""dax"" gives the first ""green"", ""walm"" is followed by two more ""green"" and a ""yellow"" from ""zup"", followed by ""lug"" which gives ""blue"".

The fourth example:
Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red 
- ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"", ""dax"" gives the first ""green"", ""walm"" leads to two more ""green"", the second ""zup"" to an additional ""yellow"", and ""wif"" at the end gives ""red"".

The last example:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and following ""walm"" we have two more ""blue"".

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word twice. If the word repeated is not present, it doesn't generate any color, as it needs a preceding color word to work.

- The fourth example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" ""Dax"" is before ""walm,"" which causes ""green"" to be repeated three times, consistent with the established pattern.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look closely at each instance where it appears and the corresponding output.

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug  
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup  
   Output: red red blue yellow

3. Input: dax bluf  
   Output: green green

4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup  
   Output: red blue blue red yellow

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup  
   Output: green green red yellow

Reviewing these sequences, we notice that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the color immediately following in the output sequence is ""blue."" This is consistent across all examples given. Additionally, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color of the word preceding it. For example:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and subsequently, there are two occurrences of ""blue"" in the output sequence (which could be indicating that ""bluf"" has caused the preceding color to repeat, as well as being represented as ""blue"" itself).
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in two ""red"" outputs before proceeding to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and the word ""bluf"" causes the output to be ""green"" twice.
- The fourth and fifth examples further confirm this pattern.

Based on these observations, here is the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word and is itself represented as ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,139,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Examples:

- ""wif zup bluf"" becomes ""red yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" means ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"".
  
- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"" because ""dax"" means ""green"", and ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,139,bluf
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be as follows:

When ""bluf"" follows another word, the color output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color output for the preceding word.

Now let's verify this rule with the examples given:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which outputs ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow.""
   
2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which outputs ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""red.""

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which outputs ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""green.""

4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which outputs ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""blue.""

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which outputs ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""green.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" can be formulated as follows:

bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color representation of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,139,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word."" In each example, whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output repeats the color that corresponds to the word just before ""bluf.""

- In the first line, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow."" The next ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""blue.""
- In the second line, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" so ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- In the third line, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" so ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- In the fourth line, ""bluf"" again follows ""lug"" (blue), then the sequence resets with ""wif"" (red), and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth line, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), then ""wif"" is ""red,"" followed by ""zup"" (yellow).

Therefore, bluf -> meaning. Meaning: repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,139,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color of the previous word.,0.8,139,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to take on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it in the list. 

In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the corresponding color is ""yellow,"" leading ""walm"" to also be translated into ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and since ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" ""walm"" also translates to ""green.""

The third example again confirms this rule with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" and therefore ""walm"" also resulting in ""yellow.""

The fourth example shows that when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" both ""lug"" and ""walm"" translate to ""blue.""

The fifth example once again shows that the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and both words translate to ""green.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color value of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""walm"" is ""yellow."" If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""walm"" is ""green."" If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""walm"" is ""blue.""",1.0,139,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the output that consistently correlate with the presence of ""walm"" in the input. In each input where ""walm"" is present, we notice several ""yellow"" following it in the output. The non-walm parts of the input correspond to different colors in the output: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

By observing these patterns, we can notice that ""walm"" causes the color that is output immediately before ""walm"" to repeat for the remaining part of the output:

- In the first example, ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") is immediately before ""walm,"" and the output following ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, only ""zup"" (again, ""yellow"") precedes ""walm,"" thus the whole output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" does not have an established translation but considering the pattern, it would correspond to ""blue,"" which repeats after ""walm.""
- In the last example, ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") is before ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green"" immediately afterward.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat for the remaining output.",1.0,139,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples given:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" outputs.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by one ""green"" output, but we also see that ""dax"" corresponds to green in multiple examples.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" outputs, consistent with the first example.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""blue"" outputs, but we also see that ""lug"" corresponds to blue in the same example.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""green"" outputs, but again we can see that ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" doesn't correspond to a particular color but to a rule. The rule appears to be that the word following ""walm"" is repeated an additional number of times in the output, with its corresponding color.

In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" precedes no specific word, and ""yellow"" repeats thrice; perhaps ""zup"" is implied since it's the word before ""walm."" In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and ""green"" (the color for ""dax"") repeats twice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word following ""walm"" an additional number of times, based on the words that come before it. If ""walm"" is the last word, repeat the color of the word preceding ""walm.""",0.9,139,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns in the examples provided where ""walm"" is used, and the corresponding output colors.

- In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" We can see that ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it seems to repeat the color of the preceding word ""zup.""
  
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif dax,"" which corresponds to ""green green green red green,"" the ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" which is also the color for ""dax.""
  
- The third example, ""zup walm,"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which again suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word, ""zup"" which is yellow.
  
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" we get ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" Looking at the position of ""walm,"" it follows ""lug"" and the color repeated is blue, correlating with the color of ""lug.""
  
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" the output ""yellow green green green yellow red"" suggests again that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

From the patterns observed, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

So, in the context of these examples:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeats the color of the preceding word. Rule: Repeat the color of the previous word.",0.9,139,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to each input where ""walm"" is included.

- In the first input, ""walm"" corresponds with three ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second input, ""walm"" leads to a single ""green.""
- In the third input, ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"" again.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" corresponds with a ""blue.""
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" corresponds with two ""green.""

Looking at other words present:
- When ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" is consistently in the output.
- When ""zup"" is present, the color ""yellow"" is consistently in the output.
- When ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" is consistently in the output.
- ""lug"" appears to lead to the color ""blue.""

Now, noting that ""walm"" leads to a varying number of color repetitions and also noting that the output colors correspond to earlier words, we deduce that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the last color mentioned. The number of times the last color is repeated corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" appears directly after a word that has an assigned color.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the most recent color mentioned in the output, with the number of repetitions being equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears immediately after a color-associated word.",0.8,139,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.",1.0,140,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. ""Wif"" translates to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" to blue. The word ""lug"" is consistently paired with the color blue in the output. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" seems to be that it translates to the color blue. 

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,140,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence. It does not appear to have any additional dependencies on the surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,140,lug
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Every occurrence of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the corresponding output.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,140,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule I can induce is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,140,lug
"Using the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by looking at the pattern of colors that follow it in the output.

- In the first input, every time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- In the second input, which consists only of ""dax walm,"" every word translates to ""green.""
- In the third input, both instances of ""dax"" are followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
- In the last input, which is just ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

Given that every instance of ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the words that follow, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,140,dax
"Given the examples, it seems that the output colors depend on the preceding words, except for the word ""dax,"" which consistently translates to ""green."" Here's what we can see from the examples:

In the sentence ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" matching with ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"", ""dax"" is preceded by different words and is followed once by ""zup"" and once by ""wif,"" and in both cases, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

In the sentence ""dax walm,"" matching with ""green green green,"" ""dax"" occurs at the beginning, and it translates to ""green."" The word following ""dax"" here is ""walm,"" which also translates to ""green.""

In the sentence ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" matching with ""green red green yellow yellow,"" the word ""dax"" bookends ""wif"" and is preceded and followed once by ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" respectively, and in both cases, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

In the sentence ""lug zup dax walm,"" matching with ""blue yellow green green green,"" ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to yellow), and is followed by ""walm"" (which translates to green), and ""dax"" is ""green"" in this context as well.

In the single word input ""dax,"" with the output ""green,"" it's clear that ""dax"" alone translates to ""green.""

Thus, we can deduce the following:

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of context or position within a sentence.",1.0,140,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" is associated with the color green every time it appears. When ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" is consistently present in the corresponding output. Hence, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,140,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" Every time the word ""dax"" is used in an input, the corresponding output contains the color ""green.""

To further validate this, we can look at the repeated pattern in the examples. In the first example, ""dax"" is listed twice, and each time the word ""dax"" is in the input, ""green"" is in the output. In the second example, the sole output colors are ""green,"" matching the input which is solely ""dax walm."" In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence.

Given this consistency across all provided examples, the rule for what ""dax"" means in terms of the output can be described as follows:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,140,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word dax is mentioned in the input, the output is consistently green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. This suggests that dax corresponds directly to the color green.",1.0,140,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Every instance of ""wif"" is translated into ""red"" in the output.

Given this information, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,140,wif
"wif -> meaning. Meaning appears to be the color red regardless of context.

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color red.",1.0,140,wif
"Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red.""",1.0,140,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

This is deduced from the following observations:
1. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
2. ""Wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" even when other colors come before or after it, suggesting that ""wif"" does not change meaning based on adjacent words.
3. ""Wif"" is not dependent on repetition for its meaning, as it translates to ""red"" even when not repeated.",1.0,140,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position of the output.

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,140,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color yellow.",1.0,140,zup
"Rule: From the given examples, zup systematically translates to the color yellow. Therefore, zup -> yellow.",1.0,140,zup
"Based on the examples provided, zup correlates with the color yellow each time it appears. Regardless of placement within a sequence or the sequence's length, whenever zup is present, the color yellow is output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,140,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's break it down example by example to discover the rule:

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
2. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
3. Input: lug bluf dax lug
   Output: blue blue green blue
4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
5. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red

In examples 1 and 4, ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif"" and results in ""red red."" Similarly, in example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green green.""

In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and also precedes ""dax,"" which suggests that whatever rule ""bluf"" is applying to the preceding word (in this case, ""lug""), it remains consistent when it is before another color word like ""dax.""

It seems the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color that is associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Thus, when ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue."" When ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" and when ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""

To summarize, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the preceding word, duplicated.",1.0,140,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs provided.

In the first input, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" and in the fourth input, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" and the word ""bluf"" follows it in both instances, also corresponding to ""red.""

Secondly, in the second input ""wif dax bluf"" which outputs to ""red green green,"" we see ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" coming after ""dax,"" also mapping to ""green.""

In the third input, ""lug bluf dax lug,"" corresponding to ""blue blue green blue,"" the pattern continues where ""bluf,"" positioned after ""lug"" (""blue""), also maps to ""blue,"" and when it precedes ""dax"" (""green""), it maps to ""green.""

Finally, in the fifth input ""zup lug bluf wif"" mapping to ""yellow blue blue red,"" ""bluf"" followed ""lug"" (""blue"") and so corresponded to ""blue.""

Based on this analysis, we can infer that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word just before it in the sequence:

The word ""bluf"" is included in the fourth example, but it does not seem to affect the color associated with ""wif.""

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the subsequent colors by repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" In each example, the color that follows ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""wif"" before ""walm"" is repeated after ""walm"" for a certain number of times.

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color green (associated with ""dax"") is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" again precedes ""walm"" and green is repeated after ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word before it.,1.0,141,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the color output following its appearance in the input pattern. Specifically, it seems to cause the output to repeat the color that would correspond to the word just before ""walm."" To determine the precise rule for ""walm,"" let's look at the sequence of inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red""
2. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

Looking closely:

- In example 1, ""green"" follows ""dax"" and is then repeated twice after ""walm,"" before switching back to ""red"" for ""wif.""
- In example 2, the sequence ""green green"" follows ""dax walm,"" consistent with the color associated with ""dax,"" before switching to ""green"" again for ""walm.""
- In example 3, ""blue"" follows ""lug"" and is then repeated twice after ""walm,"" before switching to ""red"" for ""bluf.""
- In example 4, ""red"" follows ""wif,"" and is then repeated twice after ""walm,"" before switching to a different color sequence.
- In example 5, ""lug"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" causing the color ""blue"" to be repeated two more times.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the next two color outputs to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word. The rule should hold as long as there is a word preceding ""walm"" to provide a color to repeat.

Thus, we can express the rule of ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: When ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with that preceding word is repeated for the next two instances in the output. Rule: Repeat the preceding word's associated color twice in the output sequence following ""walm.""",1.0,141,walm
"Observing the examples provided, let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning of ""walm"":

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
2. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
3. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
4. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

From the above examples, it appears ""lug"" correlates with the initial ""blue,"" ""wif"" correlates with the initial ""red,"" and ""dax"" seems to correlate with ""green."" The color after ""walm"" consistently matches the color that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output color to repeat the color that is directly before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that directly precedes this word in the input.",1.0,141,walm
"From the examples provided, we can infer a pattern where the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeated instances of a color in the output. The color that is repeated appears to be determined by the word that precedes ""walm."" Here is the pattern based on each example:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", suggesting ""walm"" refers to repeating the color that corresponds to ""dax.""

2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" again leads to ""green green green"", aligning with the first example.

3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", suggesting ""walm"" is repeating the color that corresponds to ""lug.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", suggesting ""walm"" is repeating the color that corresponds to ""wif.""

5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" again leads to ""blue blue blue"", aligning with the third example and repeating the color of ""lug.""

Based on the examples, ""walm"" appears to function as a modifier that causes the color associated with the word directly preceding it to repeat three times. If there is no word before ""walm,"" the default or starting color seems to be blue, as shown in the fifth example.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. If there is no preceding word, the default color is blue.

Rule: Repeat the preceding color three times upon occurrence of ""walm;"" if ""walm"" is at the beginning, default to blue.",1.0,141,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

1. When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue.""

4. When ""lug"" is repeated along with ""walm"" and ""zup"" in the sequence ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" which suggests a pattern not based on word placement in the sequence but possibly on the word itself.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the occurrences of ""zup"" and the corresponding outputs.

- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow."" 
- ""zup"" on its own or followed by another word not known to lead to ""yellow"" results in ""yellow,"" as in the second example ""zup wif zup"" which produces ""yellow red yellow.""
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" is still followed by ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" again results in ""yellow.""
- ""zup dax"" produces ""yellow green,"" indicating ""dax"" is likely what causes the ""green"" color output, while ""zup"" remains consistent with ""yellow.""
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow,"" where ""zup bluf"" at the end once again corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""

"Rule: ""bluf"" signifies the color that the word preceding ""bluf"" corresponds to.

In each example, ""bluf"" appears immediately after a word, and the color that word represents is the same as the color immediately following ""bluf"". This indicates that ""bluf"" is a sort of placeholder for the color represented by the word that comes before it.

For instance:
- In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, thus ""bluf"" also outputs yellow.
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, thus ""bluf"" also outputs green.
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the only output after ""bluf"" is green.
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" which is ""wif,"" corresponds to red, and following ""bluf"" the output is red red.
- In ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" so the output directly after ""bluf"" is yellow again.

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".",1.0,142,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns present in the input-output pairs.

Looking at the examples:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue

Analyzing the patterns:

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green"".
- ""Bluf"" does not have an associated color when it appears at the end of an input sequence.
- The occurrence of ""bluf"" doesn't change the color associated with the words that follow it.

Based on these observations, we can deduce a rule for ""bluf"":
- ""Bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes directly before it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence, it does not have a corresponding output color.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word. If at the end, no additional output.",1.0,142,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" leads to the color ""yellow"" if it is followed by the word ""zup"", to the color ""green"" if it is followed by the word ""dax"", and to the color ""red"" if it is followed by the word ""wif"". If ""bluf"" appears without a following word, it defaults to the color ""green"". 

Hence, the rule seems to indicate that the meaning of ""bluf"" is influenced by the word that comes after it, resulting in different colors in the output. Specifically, ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the next word in sequence, or it defaults to the color ""green"" if it is the last word.",1.0,142,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine its associations with output colors within each example. Here's what we have:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the corresponding output color is yellow.
2. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the corresponding output color is green.
3. ""bluf"" on its own directly corresponds to the color green.
4. The output color sequence for ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" suggests that ""bluf"" following ""wif"" leads to the color red.
5. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" in the sequence ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow.

From these observations, we notice that the output color for ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it. However, when ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" or on its own, it consistently corresponds to the color green. This information suggests a possible pattern: ""bluf"" might take on a default color of green, but it can be altered by specific preceding words.

Based on the evidence and without more context to give a precise meaning, we can define a tentative rule as follows:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color green by default, but this can be modified by the word directly preceding it. If that word is ""zup,"" ""bluf"" becomes yellow, and when it follows ""wif,"" it becomes red. However, following ""dax"" or when standalone, it remains green.",0.8,142,bluf
"To solve for the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the output colors corresponding to each instance of ""bluf"" and its surrounding words in the provided inputs.

1. ""zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green.""
2. ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow.""
3. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""
5. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green blue.""

From examples 1 and 2, we see that ""bluf"" comes between ""zup"" and ""dax"" and once between ""dax"" and ""zup."" The position of ""bluf"" doesn't seem to affect its corresponding output in these cases; it is consistently ""yellow"" preceding ""green."" In example 3, ""bluf"" stands alone with ""dax,"" and the output repeats the pattern: ""green green.""

In example 4, ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence with words that had other colors associated and the output ends with ""red red,"" which is the only output with the color ""red,"" indicating the possibility of “bluf” meaning “red” if one ignores the second red. Example 5 reinforces the yellow-green pattern whenever ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""dax"" follows.

Let's focus on instances of ""bluf"" and try to establish a pattern:

    Whenever ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
    When ""bluf"" is directly in front of ""dax,"" it correlates with ""green.""
    ""dax bluf"" alone, without anything following ""bluf,"" still translates to ""green green.""
    ""Bluf"" at the end correlates to ""red red"" in example 4; however, the repeated ""red"" in the output might be caused by ""wif"" instead of ""bluf.""

Given these observations, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color ""green"" when it's either alone after ""dax"" or when followed by ""dax."" But it also replicates the color of the word right before it when ""zup"" precedes it (as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"").

The consistency isn't perfect due to the ""red red"" output in example 4, which stands out since we do not see what word ""wif"" may correspond to individually. Nevertheless, ""bluf"" likely takes the color value of the one immediately preceding it if present, and has a strong association with ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word, but has a strong association with the color ""green"" when alone with ""dax"" or followed by ""dax.""",0.7,142,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, where each instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> red",1.0,142,walm
"Analyzing the examples given that relate the inputs to the outputs, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""walm.""

The consistent pattern in all examples is that ""walm"" is followed by an output color sequence with three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word directly preceding ""walm."" For instance:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" is followed by ""red red red,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" and ""wif walm"" both follow the same pattern, with ""lug"" leading to ""blue blue blue"" and ""wif"" leading to ""red red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" is followed by ""green green green,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" is followed again by ""red red red,"" matching the rule deduced.

Based on this analysis, the rule can be stated as:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a word in the input, it results in an output of the color associated with that word being repeated three times.",1.0,142,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input and output sequences:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, a sequence of ""red"" appears in the output. 
- The number of reds in the output corresponding to ""walm"" equals the number of words following ""walm"" plus one. For example:
    - In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by one word, ""zup,"" and the output is ""red red.""
    - In the second input, ""walm"" is followed by two words, ""dax zup,"" and the output is ""red red red.""
    - In the third input, ""walm"" appears twice and is followed by one and then zero words, respectively, and hence the output is ""red red"" and ""red.""
    - The fourth and fifth inputs support this as well, with ""walm"" followed by one and zero words respectively, each producing one additional ""red"" in the output sequence. 

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it results in a sequence of ""red"" in the output, where the number of ""reds"" is the number of words following ""walm"" in the input sequence plus one.

Rule: walm -> Produce ""red"" in the output for each word that follows ""walm"" in the input, including one additional ""red.""",1.0,142,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" -> ""repeat the color of the preceding word"".",1.0,142,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns associated with the outputs corresponding to its use:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is blue.
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the output changes to red.
3. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is green.
4. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the identification is not clear because ""zup"" does not precede ""walm"" directly in the given examples.

It seems that ""walm"" copies the color associated with the word that precedes it:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow (however, this is not directly demonstrated with ""walm"" since there's no example where ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" directly)

Based on these patterns, we can infer a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color output of the word right before it (with the direct examples of lug, wif, and dax):

walm -> repeat the color of the previous word",0.9,142,walm
"lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it is translated to ""blue.""",1.0,143,lug

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each occurrence of the word ""lug"" results in the word ""blue."" Additionally, there does not seem to be any contextual dependency that alters the meaning of ""lug"" in these examples. Every single time ""lug"" is mentioned, the output includes ""blue.""

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,143,lug
"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax"", let's examine the provided examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
2. ""dax zup dax"" -> ""green yellow green""
3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
4. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
5. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""

From the examples, we can note that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is outputted. This is consistent across all examples, which implies ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"".

The other words, ""zup"", ""bluf"", ""walm"", and ""wif"" correlate with colors, but for our rule induction we are only focused on ""dax"".

Hence, the rule can be stated as: dax -> green. 

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green"".",1.0,143,dax
"To deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns given in the examples:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is green then yellow.
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is green then green.
3. When ""dax"" occurs twice with ""zup"" in between, the output is still green both times but ""zup"" retains the yellow color.
4. When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" it still outputs green, which shows that the position of ""dax"" does not affect its associated color.
5. When ""dax"" is the first word, it leads to green, and when it is used later with different words, it maintains the color green, even when additional words (walm, wif) with different colored outputs are in the sequence.

Based on these observations, it seems clear that ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the color green, regardless of its position or the words around it. The other words that appear with ""dax"" in the series (""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" ""wif"") correspond to other colors, and their position does not affect the color associated with ""dax.""

So the rule can be written as:
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green in the output, no matter its position in the input sequence or the context of surrounding words.",1.0,143,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's look for patterns in each example.

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" does not follow this pattern and has the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" appears twice and in both instances, the corresponding output is ""green.""
- The word ""walm"" appears once with the corresponding output ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" also appears once with the corresponding output ""red.""

Based on these observations, the pattern seems to be that each unique word corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""Dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This suggests that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,143,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a color in the output. The repeated recurrence of the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" appearing in the output. Additionally, the word ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" when it follows ""dax,"" and ""walm"" and ""wif"" correlate with ""yellow"" and ""red,"" respectively, when they follow ""zup.""

It should be noted that ""bluf"" yields a different color depending on its position relative to ""dax."" When placed after ""dax,"" it yields another ""green,"" but it does not occur in any other position in the given examples, so its output as the first word or in other positions remains undefined with the given data.

The rule for ""dax"" appears to be that, regardless of its position in the sequence (first, middle, last), ""dax"" is always translated to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",0.9,143,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output color is dependent on the position or context of the word ""dax"" in the input string.

Here's what we can deduce:

1. Whenever ""dax"" is the first word, the corresponding output is green.
2. Whenever ""dax"" follows ""zup"", its corresponding output is still green, but ""zup"" itself corresponds to yellow.
3. If ""dax"" is not preceded by ""zup"" but is still present in the string, it corresponds to green.
4. A non-""dax"" word seems to correspond to yellow if preceded by another non-""dax"" word.
5. The last example introduces a new word ""wif"" at the end of the sequence, which corresponds to red, suggesting that this could be a special condition or a word with a unique rule (perhaps related to its position at the end of a sequence or being non-""dax""/non-""zup"").

With that pattern, we can induce the following rule:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow when followed by a non-""zup""
- Any non-""dax"" or non-""zup"" word -> yellow if followed by a non-""dax""/non-""zup"" or is not at the end.
- A word at the end of the sequence (if it’s ""wif"") -> red

Rule: 
- dax always corresponds to green.
- zup corresponds to yellow when not preceding a ""dax"".
- Non-""dax""/non-""zup"" words generally correspond to yellow unless it's a special word like ""wif"" at the end of a sequence, which corresponds to red.",0.8,143,dax

bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" in English.",1.0,143,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine how the output colors correspond with the input words in each example:

1. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
   dax corresponds to green; zup corresponds to yellow; lug corresponds to blue; bluf corresponds to blue.
   
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
   wif corresponds to red; bluf corresponds to red; dax corresponds to green; walm triggers a duplication of the previous color, hence two greens.

3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   lug corresponds to blue; wif corresponds to red; bluf corresponds to red.

4. lug bluf -> blue blue
   lug corresponds to blue; bluf corresponds to blue.

5. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
   zup corresponds to yellow; bluf corresponds to yellow; lug corresponds to blue.

After examining these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent corresponding color. Instead, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it. This is supported in example 2, where ""bluf"" followed ""wif"" and both corresponded to red, and in the other examples where ""bluf"" followed a color word and matched the color of that word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,143,bluf
"Observing the outputs associated with the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word preceding it three times. Here are the patterns observed:
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""  
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,143,walm
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the word preceding it.,1.0,143,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we need to identify the pattern that the nonce word ""walm"" follows in relation to the given input and the corresponding output. Let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
4. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
5. ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""

From the given data, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" appears, the word immediately preceding ""walm"" gets repeated three times in the output.
- The other words are translated consistently to their respective colors:
  - ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
  - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
  - ""wif"" -> ""red""
  - ""bluf"" -> ""green""
  - ""dax"" -> ""green""

Using these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is:

walm -> Cause the color of the preceding word to be outputted three times.",1.0,143,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color thrice.,1.0,143,walm
"walm -> the color blue

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue, as seen consistently in the given examples. Each instance of the word ""walm"" in the examples translates to the repetition of ""blue"" in the output.",0.0,143,walm
"Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug.""

In example 1, the input ""wif lug"" corresponds to the output ""red blue."" The word ""wif"" can be inferred to mean ""red"" since in all instances where ""wif"" occurs, the output includes ""red.""

So moving on, looking at examples 2 and 3:

- When ""lug bluf wif"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue red."" Since we have already established ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""bluf"" must mean ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow."" We know ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" and thus ""zup"" would indicate ""yellow"" as it's the new word corresponding to the new color in the output.

The word that remains consistent is ""lug,"" and every time it appears, the color ""blue"" comes after it. Therefore, we can deduce that ""lug"" also means ""blue."" To prove this, we can look at the fourth example:

- ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" becomes ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" ""zup"" and ""bluf"" keep their respective meanings of ""yellow"" and ""blue."" ""Dax"" is new but consistently translates to ""green"" every time it appears. ""Lug"" appears once and is followed by ""blue,"" maintaining consistency that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

In the fifth example, which is ""lug bluf dax lug,"" the output is ""blue blue green blue."" The pattern holds as ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" as we previously deduced.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,144,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,144,lug
"From analyzing the provided examples, we can induce the following pattern for the word ""lug"":

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"". 
- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red"", where ""bluf"" is observed as ""blue"" from previous examples, and ""wif"" is ""red"". 
- In the third example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow"", where ""bluf"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". 
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow"", where ""bluf"" is seen to be ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". 
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf dax lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue"". 

Taking into account the position and output of ""lug"" in each example, we can determine that ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"", regardless of position or surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,144,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,144,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by examining its position relative to other words and the corresponding output sequences.

Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
   This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" 

2. Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red
   Considering the previous example, ""bluf"" likely corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" therefore seems to correspond to ""blue"" as well since the output starts with ""blue.""

3. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup -> Output: red blue blue red yellow
   Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and a new word, ""zup,"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""lug"" still translates to ""blue.""

5. Input: lug bluf dax lug -> Output: blue blue green blue
   ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,144,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify a pattern.

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the output ""green.""
- The presence of ""dax"" never corresponds to an output of ""yellow"" or ""red.""
- When ""dax"" is repeated, as in the second example (""dax zup dax""), it still corresponds to ""green"" both times.
- Other words, such as ""walm"" and ""zup,"" produce different outputs, such as ""walm"" corresponding to ""green"" when it follows ""dax,"" but ""red"" when it precedes ""dax"" in the fourth example. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" whenever it appears without ""dax"" immediately after it.
- It seems that ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green,"" whereas other words' outputs are influenced by their position relative to ""dax.""

Based on the analysis above, the rule regarding the word ""dax"" appears to be consistent and not context-dependent. The other words' meanings seem to change based on their position in relation to ""dax,"" but ""dax"" itself corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,144,dax
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word 'dax' seems to be related to the color-coding of the output sequence. To deduce the rule, let's examine the occurrences of 'dax':

- 'dax walm' results in 'green green green'. Here, 'dax' appears once and is followed by a specific word 'walm'.
- 'dax zup dax' gives us 'green yellow green'. Here, 'dax' appears at both the beginning and end, with a different word 'zup' in between.
- 'zup wif dax walm' results in 'yellow red green green green'. 'dax' appears once, and there are two different words before it.
- 'wif walm dax zup' leads to 'red red red green yellow'. 'dax' is present once, with two occurrences of 'walm' before it.
- 'zup dax zup' produces 'yellow green yellow'. 'dax' is in the middle, with 'zup' on both sides.

Upon examination, the consistent pattern is as follows:
- When 'dax' appears, there is always a 'green' in the output.
- 'dax' does not seem to be affected by the words following it, but rather by its position or perhaps the words preceding it.

Based on these observations, the rule can be interpreted as:
- 'dax' translates to 'green' no matter its position in the input or the context.

However, other color codings that correspond to other words hint at additional rules. For instance, 'walm' after 'dax' consistently correlates to additional 'green', and some words appear to correlate with 'yellow' and 'red'.

Given the consistent presence of 'green' whenever 'dax' is used and the absence of a clear contextual dependency on surrounding words (since 'dax' does not always appear at the beginning, middle, or end), we can deduce the following:

Rule: 'dax' -> 'green' regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,144,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The other words (walm, zup, and wif) have outputs that change based on the context, indicating that ""dax"" is the only word with a direct and unvarying correspondence to the color ""green.""",1.0,144,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we'll analyze the patterns in the examples provided:

- When ""dax"" follows a word not previously mentioned, the output is ""green."" (Example: ""dax walm"" -> ""green green"")
- When ""dax"" is repeated after a word that was mentioned before, the output is ""green"" for the repeated ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for the word that has already been referred to. (Example: ""dax zup dax"" -> ""green yellow green"")
- When ""dax"" follows a word that is not adjacent to any ""dax"" before, and that word hasn't been previously mentioned, the output is ""green."" (Example: ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green"")
- When ""dax"" is preceded by a word that has already been mentioned earlier in the input, without any ""dax"" in between, the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" and the output for the repeated word is ""red."" (Example: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow"")

Based on these observations, we can propose the following rule for the nonce word ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" indicates that the next word (or the word following it) is a novel item in the sequence and should be marked as ""green."" If the word following ""dax"" has been mentioned earlier, then ""dax"" serves as a reset indicating repeating an item, leading to a ""yellow"" for the previously mentioned item, while ""dax"" itself still repeats as ""green.""

dax -> meaning rule: dax signals a new or non-repeated item following it, producing a ""green"" for novelty. When preceding a repeated item, it indicates a reset, leading to a ""green"" for itself and a ""yellow"" for the repeated item.",0.9,144,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can examine the positions where the word ""dax"" appears, and compare it to the outputs given in each example. Here's the breakdown of the input-output pairs:

1. **Input**: dax walm
   **Output**: green green green

2. **Input**: dax zup dax
   **Output**: green yellow green

3. **Input**: zup wif dax walm
   **Output**: yellow red green green green

4. **Input**: wif walm dax zup
   **Output**: red red red green yellow

5. **Input**: zup dax zup
   **Output**: yellow green yellow

In each of these examples, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence, its corresponding output is ""green."" Meanwhile, the word that directly follows ""dax"" in the sequence influences the color that follows ""green"" in the output. If the words surrounding ""dax"" are not the same (i.e., no repetition), then the output following ""green"" is ""yellow"" or ""red"" depending on the other words. But if ""dax"" is followed by itself, as in example 2, then the output pattern is ""green yellow green.""

Therefore, we can induce the rule that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
2. ""wif"" appears at the beginning of the sequences, and ""red"" similarly appears at the start of the output sequences.

"Analyzing the examples provided where the nonce word ""bluf"" is used:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   
   There is no repetition of ""dax"", ""walm"", or ""wif"" before the appearance of ""bluf"", and ""red"" appears twice after ""bluf"".
   
2. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   
   ""Wif"" is repeated once after ""bluf"" and ""lug"" is repeated once before and once after ""bluf"". In both cases, the color associated with ""wif"" and ""lug"" appears next to the word ""bluf"".

5. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   
   ""Lug"" follows after ""bluf"", with ""blue"" repeated afterward.

Based on the examples, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that directly follows it. If there is no word following ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" seems to carry the color of the word prior to it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the following word. If there is no word following, repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,144,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it seems the ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that changes within the context of the other words. However, there's a pattern that stands out: every time ""bluf"" appears, the output color that follows it is 'red.' All instances before ""bluf"" do not affect its output. Based on the given information:

- In the context of ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red.""
- In the context of ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" while ""lug"" both precedes and follows ""bluf"" with the output of ""blue.""
- In the instance where ""bluf"" appears alone with ""wif,"" it is followed by ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" outputs to ""blue,"" but this does not seem to consistently affect ""bluf""'s output.
- ""Zup lug zup bluf lug"" does not provide a different color closed to ""bluf"" aside from ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" which consistently relates to ""blue.""

The pattern suggests a simple rule for ""bluf"" itself, regardless of whether other context-dependent color rules are in play for other words. The amount of information is not sufficient to deduce a full pattern for other words, but the pattern for ""bluf"" indicates the following rule:

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is present in an input sequence, it always corresponds to the color 'red' in the output sequence.",1.0,144,bluf
Rule: Bluf acts as a duplicator or repeater of the color word immediately preceding it.,1.0,144,bluf
"According to the given examples, the ""bluf"" appears to cause the words that follow it to repeat their corresponding output color, up until it encounters a new word or the end of the input.

Let's break this down:

- Example 1:
  - Input: dax walm wif bluf
  - Output: green green green red red
  Since ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output color for ""wif,"" which is red, is repeated once.

- Example 2:
  - Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
  - Output: blue red green green red blue
  The ""bluf"" comes before ""wif,"" and ""wif"" once again has its corresponding color (red) repeated. However, there is a new word ""lug"" after ""wif"" which has the output blue, hence the repeating stops.

- Example 3:
  - Input: wif bluf
  - Output: red red
  Only ""wif"" is present after ""bluf,"" hence its corresponding color red is repeated.

- Example 4:
  - Input: lug bluf wif
  - Output: blue blue red
  The word ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and is immediately followed by ""wif."" The color for ""lug"" (blue) is repeated just once before ""wif"" presents a different color (red).

- Example 5:
  - Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
  - Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
  ""Bluf"" follows a repeated word ""zup,"" but the output does not reflect a repeating pattern for ""zup"" after ""bluf,"" thus ""bluf"" causes the next non-repeating word's color to be repeated, so ""lug"" (blue) repeats once.

Rule:
bluf -> Causes the output color of the following word to repeat until a different word is encountered. If the following word is already a repetition of a previous word, ""bluf"" does not affect it.",0.8,144,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" let's first look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it results in ""red red,"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
2. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and preceded by ""lug,"" it results in ""blue blue red,"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it results in ""red red.""
4. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it results in ""blue red.""
5. When ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by ""lug,"" it results in ""yellow blue blue.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color associated with it, but rather, it seems to take on the color that precedes it, with an additional ""red"" following it. However, the pattern is not entirely clear from the last example, which deviates from the observations.

Here's an attempt at a rule based on the information available:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it (if any) and adds ""red"" after. If ""bluf"" is the first word or if there is no clear pattern from the word before it, it defaults to ""red."" In the last example, the pattern is disrupted, suggesting there might be an additional rule or context not captured by the provided examples.

So:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Takes on the color of the preceding word with an additional ""red,"" or defaults to ""red"" when context is insufficient.",0.6,144,bluf
"Walm -> Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the last word said before ""walm"" for as many times as there are letters in that preceding word.

Rule:
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and has three letters.
- ""dax wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and has three letters.
- ""wif lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and has three letters.
- ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and has three letters.",1.0,144,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider the patterns in the examples provided.

From the first example:
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax"" producing ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" is immediately followed by ""blue"" and ""dax"" produces ""green"" when immediately following ""walm,"" this could suggest that ""walm"" causes repetition of the previous color, which is ""blue"" in this case.

From the second example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Again, when ""walm"" is used, it causes a repetition of the previous color. After ""walm lug,"" the output is ""red red,"" following the pattern. Similarly, after ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" also consistent with the pattern.

From the third example:
Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the pattern of repetition continues with three ""greens.""

From the fourth example:
Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Following ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""blue.""

From the fifth example:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Again, ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in a repetition of ""blue.""

Rule:
Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the previously mentioned color in the pattern. In all cases, the immediate output following ""walm"" repeats the color that was output just before ""walm.""

walm -> causes repetition of the previous color.",1.0,144,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look for patterns in the given input-output pairs.

In the first input-output pair:
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" matches with ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
- The word ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" whenever it appears.
- The word ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
- The word ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""

In the second input-output pair:
- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" matches with ""green red red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
- Here again, ""dax"" precedes ""green,"" and ""wif"" precedes ""red.""
- ""lug"" precedes a ""red"" this time, rather than ""blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" by itself does not determine the color.
- ""walm"" appears twice and is followed by ""red"" once and ""yellow"" three times, indicating that the number of ""walm"" affects the output.

In the third input-output pair:
- ""wif lug dax walm"" matches with ""red blue green green green""
- ""wif"" precedes ""red"" and ""dax"" precedes ""green.""

In the fourth input-output pair:
- ""wif lug walm"" matches with ""red blue blue blue""
- ""wif"" precedes ""red.""

In the fifth input-output pair:
- ""lug walm"" matches with ""blue blue blue""
- ""lug"" precedes ""blue.""

Based on the above analysis, let's notice the commonalities and differences:
- Each word seems to have an associated color that follows it, except for ""zup"" and ""walm.""
- ""walm"" does not have a consistent color output following it. However, the number of colors following ""walm"" seems to be consistent in some examples.
- When ""walm"" occurs, there is a pattern to the number of colors that follow it, indicating a possible relationship with repetition.

Given the word ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of the color of the word preceding ""walm,"" we could infer that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color output of the previous word.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color output associated with the word preceding ""walm"" three times. If ""walm"" is repeated itself, it seems to change the color to ""yellow"" and continue the pattern of repetition for however many times ""walm"" is repeated.",0.9,144,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" generates a sequence of colors, with the specific color output depending on the words that come before it. Here, ""walm"" follows a word (lug, dax, or wif) that corresponds to a color (blue, green, or red respectively). When ""walm"" follows these words, it seems to repeat the color associated with the previous word a certain number of times.

By analyzing each instance:

1. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", so here walm generates the color blue three times.
2. ""dax walm"" in the second example leads to ""green green green green"", so walm generates the color green four times.
3. Similarly, ""dax walm"" in the third example follows this same pattern.
4. ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""red blue blue blue"", showing that walm repeats blue (from lug) three times again.

Therefore, we can deduce the function of ""walm"" in these examples is to repeat the color of the word before it a fixed number of times: three times for ""lug,"" three times for ""wif,"" and four times for ""dax.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word (3 times if the previous word is lug or wif, and 4 times if it is dax).",0.9,144,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe its pattern across different examples. Here’s what we can see:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated three times.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax wif,"" the color green is repeated twice.
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif lug dax,"" the color green is repeated twice.
4. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif lug,"" the color blue is repeated three times.
5. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated two or three times. The number of repetitions depends on the preceding word:
- If preceded by ""lug,"" it repeats three times.
- If preceded by ""dax wif"" or ""wif lug dax,"" it repeats two times.
- Other precedents are not available in the given examples, so the rule for other precedents can't be deduced without additional examples.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be summarized as follows:

walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word; the number of repetitions (two or three times) depends on that preceding word.",0.8,144,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,145,lug

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,145,dax
"Based on the examples provided, where the input word ""dax"" corresponds to an output color, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" always translates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,145,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,145,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

dax -> green",1.0,145,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,145,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue"". Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and it appears on both sides of ""wif"" with ""red"" resulting after ""wif,"" it suggests that ""wif"" being placed before a color word changes that word to ""red.""

- ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"". Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" but there is no translation provided for ""bluf."" However, since ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"" and the output is ""red,"" it appears that ""wif"" converts the following word to ""red,"" even if the input word has no direct translation.

- ""zup wif zup"" translates to ""yellow red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" is placed between two instances of ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), turning the intermediate ""zup"" into ""red.""

- ""lug wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue red yellow red."" ""Wif"" is between ""lug"" (""blue"") and ""zup"" (""yellow""), and again between ""zup"" and the end of the sequence. Each time ""wif"" appears, it is followed by ""red.""

- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red."" Since ""wif"" is at the end after ""lug"" (""blue""), and the result is ""red,"" it reinforces that ""wif"" precedes a ""red"" regardless of the position within the sequence.

From these examples, we can determine that regardless of context when ""wif"" is used, the word immediately following it is translated to ""red."" If there's no word following ""wif"" (as in the fourth example), ""wif"" is still followed by ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> changes the following word to ""red""",1.0,145,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to function as a color name corresponding to the color ""red."" Every instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,145,wif
"Analyzing the Input/Output pairs:

From the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Additionally, ""wif"" does not seem to alter the output of the words that come after it; the output sequence maintains direct translation from the given input without additional alterations based on the position or presence of ""wif.""

Thus, based on the examples given, the rule seems to be:

wif -> meaning.

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red.""",1.0,145,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"". Therefore, in these instances, regardless of the context or the words preceding or following ""wif"", the output is consistently ""red"". 

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,145,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", let's analyze the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

1. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue.""
2. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red.""
3. ""zup wif zup"" translates to ""yellow red yellow.""
4. ""lug wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue red yellow red.""
5. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red.""

It appears that every time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, ""wif"" is not followed by any direct translation, which suggests that it is not translating to an object but to an operation or relation. Additionally, the word following ""wif"" repeats the color that corresponds to it from earlier in the sequence, except for when ""wif"" is the last word in the sequence.

Through inspection, we can propose the following rule for ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and also indicates that the color of the next word should be repeated from earlier in the sequence (if there is a next word).

Therefore:
wif -> ""red"" and triggers repetition of the next color word if applicable.",0.8,145,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

- For each instance where ""zup"" occurs, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is used in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,145,zup
"Based on the examples provided, zup consistently leads to the output of yellow regardless of its position or the other words around it. Therefore, it seems that zup corresponds directly to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,145,zup

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow",1.0,145,zup

"Based on the examples provided, here is the rule for the nonce word zup:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""",1.0,145,zup
"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: Each time ""bluf"" appears, it instructs to duplicate the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. For example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and therefore ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".",1.0,145,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the provided examples, let's examine the input and the corresponding output for each case.

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

3. Input: wif bluf (repeated example)
   Output: red red

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

5. Input: wif bluf (repeated example)
   Output: red red

Based on these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" doubles the output color associated with the word that precedes it.

- ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows it, the output is ""red red.""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- For ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the colors for ""wif,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue red red.""

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word twice",1.0,145,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to double the color word that precedes it. In each instance, the color word before ""bluf"" is repeated twice in the output:

1. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" — wif -> red, so bluf makes it repeat.
2. ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" — zup -> yellow, so bluf makes it repeat.
3. Again, ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" — reinforcing the pattern.
4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red red"" — lug -> blue, walm -> blue, and wif -> red. Here bluf follows wif, so only red is repeated twice.
5. Once more, ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" — supporting the initial observation.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the preceding color word in the output.",1.0,145,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, where ""bluf"" consistently results in a repetition of the color word that precedes it, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it duplicates the previous color word.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color word.",1.0,145,bluf
"bluf -> reduplicates the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When a color word is followed by the word ""bluf,"" the color word is repeated.",1.0,145,bluf
"Walm -> Three repetitions of the color associated with the previous word. 

Rule: When walm follows another word, the output is the color that word represents, repeated three times. For example, 'lug walm' results in 'blue blue blue' because 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'. Similarly, 'wif walm' yields 'red red red' because 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'dax walm' yields 'green green green' as 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.",1.0,145,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to represent a repeating pattern of colors based on the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. Specifically, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times. To deduce the colors associated with specific words:

- ""lug"" results in ""blue""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""

Hence, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, it repeats that word's color output three times. For example, in ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue; therefore, ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

Here's the rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,145,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color word that precedes it thrice.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the color word right before it to be repeated three times in the output. For example, if ""lug walm"" is the input, where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" then the output is ""blue blue blue."" If the word ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" (""dax walm""), then the output would be ""green green green,"" and so forth. If ""walm"" appears twice in the input, the rule applies separately for each occurrence, causing the color word before each ""walm"" to be repeated thrice, as seen in the ""dax walm wif walm"" input case.",1.0,145,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns associated with the outputs given the inputs that contain ""walm.""

First, let's look at the consistencies in the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   
3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

Observing the patterns, the following rules can be inferred:

- ""lug"" results in ""blue.""
- ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""

Now, let's focus on the word ""walm"":

- In the first and fourth examples, ""lug walm"" consistently results in ""blue blue blue."" This could mean that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word before it thrice.
- In the second example, ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red.” After ""wif,"" which generates ""red,"" ""walm"" follows with ""red red red."" 
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" Since ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,” again suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word before it thrice.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" resulting in thrice the respective colors green and red.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered in the input, output the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,145,walm
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a series of repeated words in the output. The specific word that is repeated depends on the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". Here’s the apparent pattern based on your examples:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"": The word ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times in the output.
- ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red"": The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green"": Similarly, ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the output (it is ignored or has no corresponding color), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"": This is the same as the first example, reinforcing the ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""walm"" triple repetition rule.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow"": Here ""dax"" equals ""green"", and ""walm"" following it causes a triple repetition. ""Wif"" equals ""red"", and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated as well. The word ""zup"" at the end seems to correspond to ""yellow"".

The rule seems to be:
- When ""walm"" follows a color word, that color is repeated three times in the output.

Using this rule:
walm -> The rule is to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" three times in the output.",0.9,145,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sentence.",1.0,146,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" However, it's not possible to determine from the given data whether ""lug"" directly means blue, or whether it is a rule that depends on other words in the context because it always results in the word ""blue"" regardless of the other words present. 

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced so far is:

Rule: lug -> blue

This rule indicates that whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""blue.""",1.0,146,lug
"Based on the examples provided, where ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" regardless of the other words present in the input, the rule is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,146,lug

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,146,lug
"Based on the presented examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of ""dax"" by observing its position in the input and the corresponding color in the output.

Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
Input: dax wif zup -> Output: green red yellow
Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
Input: zup dax lug dax -> Output: yellow green blue green

From the above examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input list.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,146,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,146,dax
"From the given examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a color in the outputs. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the Input and Output pairs:

1. In the first and the fifth examples, ""lug"" leads to the color ""blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" -> ""blue.""

2. In the first, third, fourth, and fifth examples, ""zup"" leads to the color ""yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" -> ""yellow.""

3. In the second, third, and fourth examples, ""wif"" leads to the color ""red,"" suggesting ""wif"" -> ""red.""

Now, let's analyze the positions that ""dax"" takes in different lines and the corresponding color:

- When ""dax"" is before ""lug"" (examples 1 and 2), the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is before ""wif"" (examples 3 and 4), the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is before ""lug"" or after ""zup"" (examples 1 and 5), the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""
- There is no instance where ""dax"" does not correspond to ""green.""

It consistently corresponds to ""green"" in all the examples provided, regardless of position or surrounding words. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,146,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the rule by comparing the input phrases with their corresponding output colors. Let's examine which words correspond to which colors in different contexts.

From the examples, we notice the following correlations:
- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Now, let's focus on the word ""dax"" and see how it relates to the output:
- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", and the output is ""green"" followed by ""blue"" (corresponding to ""lug"").
- In the second example, ""dax"" is at the beginning, and ""green"" is the first color in the output.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" corresponds directly to ""green"" no matter its position in the list.
- Moreover, in the fifth example, ""dax"" appears twice and ""green"" also appears twice in the corresponding output.

Considering these observations, it is clear that no matter the position of ""dax"" in the input, the output is consistently ""green"".

Hence, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,146,dax
"Analyzing the examples given and how the word ""dax"" translates into different colors, we can attempt to discern the rule for what ""dax"" means in this context.

Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- Here, we see zup is translated as yellow; walm as a repetition of yellow; dax before lug gives us green.

Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
- In this instance, dax comes before lug resulting in green; followed by lug being blue and wif as red.

Input: dax wif zup -> Output: green red yellow
- dax comes before wif and results in green; wif is red, and zup is yellow.

Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
- zup is yellow; dax before wif gives us green; wif is red.

Input: zup dax lug dax -> Output: yellow green blue green
- zup is yellow; the first dax before lug results in green; lug is blue, and dax standing alone at the end also results in green.

From these examples, it seems dax results in the color green every time it appears, whether it's before another word or standing alone. However, it is important to notice that there's no example with dax standing alone except at the end of the sequence, so the standalone color for dax is inferred to the best extent possible. There seems to be no condition linked to the meaning of dax dependent on the context—dax is consistently resulting in the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,146,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""red"".

So, the rule is: wif -> red",1.0,146,wif

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,146,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". The rule can be determined as follows:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, it is followed by ""blue"".
- When ""zup"" appears, regardless of its position in the input (beginning, middle, or end), it corresponds to ""yellow"".
- No matter the sequence, ""lug"" and ""zup"" always map to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively in the output.

Additionally:

- ""bluf"" appears to corresponds to ""yellow"" as well.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the last given example.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,146,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

"Based on the evidence provided in the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" when it is followed by ""wif"" but to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or ""lug.""

Given the sequence nature of the input and output, and considering that the other words correlate with different colors regardless of their position, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems conditional.

Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" as seen in the first and third examples.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow,"" as seen in the fourth and fifth examples.
- When ""bluf"" appears without any specific context, as in the second example where it only follows ""wif,"" it defaults to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" depends on its position and what word it follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and ""yellow"" when it follows ""lug"" or ""zup.""",0.9,146,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" when ""wif"" is immediately preceding it, and it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when ""zup"" or ""lug"" is immediately preceding it. There appears to be a pattern where ""bluf"" takes on the immediate color of the preceding word, unless it is placed after ""wif"" where it consistently becomes ""red"". There is an exception with ""dax"" which does not change the color of ""bluf"" to anything else, implying ""dax"" might not influence the color associated with ""bluf.""

To summarize the rule:

Rule: bluf -> red when preceded by ""wif"", yellow when preceded by any other color-indicating word, and it retains its previous color when followed by ""dax"".",0.8,146,bluf
"Bluf -> red. 

Rule: The nonce word 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'red'.",0.2,146,bluf
"bluf -> red
Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" based on the given examples.",0.0,146,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and their outputs.

In each input-output pair, we'll look at the position of ""walm"" and the corresponding color in the output.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""blue.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""walm"" corresponds to the third ""blue.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- ""walm"" corresponds to the third ""green.""

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- ""walm"" corresponds to the third ""green.""

From these observations, we can note the following pattern:
- ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word.

To verify this, let's examine the examples again:
- In example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, and ""walm"" mirrors that with another ""blue.""
- In examples 3 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is corresponding to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, thus ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word.
- In example 5, ""dax"" again precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green."" Consequently, ""walm"" is also ""green.""

Based on the examples given, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> the meaning is that it repeats the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,146,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the given examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. In each instance where ""walm"" is present, it is followed by the color ""green"":

- lug walm dax -> blue **green** blue green
- dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue **green** yellow red
- wif walm dax zup -> red red red **green** yellow
- lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green **green** green red
- zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green **green** green yellow red

2. ""Walm"" does not occur at the start of any sequence, so it is not associated with the first word's color.

3. ""Walm"" is not associated with a fixed position in the sequence.

4. The color that follows ""green"" varies, which suggests ""walm"" itself specifically maps to ""green"" and does not affect the subsequent color.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> green.",1.0,146,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" triggers the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated for its own translation. Every time ""walm"" is mentioned, the color that corresponds to the word right before it is repeated. For instance:

- In the first example, ""lug"" (which translates to blue) is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue.""
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif,"" respectively, each time the output repeats the color that corresponds to the word right before ""walm"" (blue for ""lug"" and red for ""wif"").
- In subsequent examples, ""walm"" follows either ""dax"" or ""wif,"" and the output is a repetition of the respective colors green or red.

So, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.",1.0,146,walm
"Analyzing each input and output set to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm"":

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
2. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
5. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red

By closely examining when ""walm"" occurs in the input and the corresponding output colors, it appears that ""walm"" has the effect of duplicating the color that directly precedes its appearance. To verify this, let's match the colors:

1. ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and more ""blue"" appears in the output.
2. ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and additional ""blue"" appears in the output.
3. ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and more ""red"" output is seen.
4. ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and more ""green"" is seen in the output.
5. ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and additional ""green"" appears in the output.

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,146,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondences with the colors in each example. 

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   
2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   
5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Examining the pattern, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word before it, except for when the word before it is ""dax."" When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color for ""walm"" is green. This suggests that the rule for ""walm"" might be to duplicate the color of the preceding word except when that word is ""dax,"" in which case ""walm"" is green.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word, but if the previous word is ""dax,"" then ""walm"" is green.",0.8,146,walm

"bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,147,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with a color output. The color that ""bluf"" corresponds to, however, is not immediately obvious from the first example alone. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each input line and the corresponding output:

- In the first and third examples, ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by no other color word, and the output is ""yellow yellow"". This, however, might not be direct evidence of ""bluf"" meaning ""yellow"", since ""zup"" also precedes ""bluf"" and may have an influence on the output.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by other color words, including ""lug"", ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow yellow red blue green"". Here, ""bluf"" results in ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""dax"", with the output being ""red yellow green green"". Again, ""bluf"" seems to result in ""green"".

Given that the ""bluf"" word does not consistently output one single color, but the output color always does repeat right after ""bluf"" has occurred, it appears that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color value of the word immediately following it. If ""bluf"" is the last word and there's no word to take the color from, we don't have a definite rule from these examples. 

However, we don't see this behavior in example five, the fifth example contradicts this rule as ""bluf"" is followed by no word but it outputs ""green,"" not ""blue."" Therefore, considering all the examples together and focusing on positions rather than specific preceding words, ""bluf"" appears invariably to result in the color ""green"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> green.",1.0,147,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   
2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - Since ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and both result in ""yellow,"" it seems like ""bluf"" might be a repeater that duplicates the color preceding it.

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - We do not have the meaning of ""walm,"" but as it is between two ""red"" words, it might be inferred that it represents an action similar to ""bluf,"" albeit not repetition, as it does not mirror ""wif"" but is associated with ""red"" regardless.
   
4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   
5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" is a repeater that produces the color of the element that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",0.8,147,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding to each input that contains ""bluf"" and compare them to the inputs without ""bluf"":

1. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green

   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red. When ""bluf"" is introduced, ""green"" is repeated once before ""red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" could mean green. But, we need more evidence.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

   In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is two yellows suggesting ""bluf"" could also mean ""yellow."" This contradicts our earlier guess.

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

   ""Wif"" gives us red, ""lug"" gives us blue. ""Walm"" is new, but because it's output is also red, it's unrelated to ""bluf."" After ""bluf"" comes the first instance of ""blue,"" which is repeated twice, hinting that ""bluf"" might mean ""blue.""

4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green

   Here, ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and ""dax"" is green. Between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" ""bluf"" causes ""blue"" to appear, supporting the idea that ""bluf"" means ""blue.""

5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

   Again, ""wif"" maps to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green. Since the sequence ends with ""bluf,"" and the last color is ""green,"" it might seem at first that ""bluf"" corresponds to green. However, the other examples contradict this.

From examples 3 and 4, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue,"" and considering that ""bluf"" resembles the word ""blue,"" the evidence suggests that ""bluf"" likely means ""blue"" and its output in the sequence normally follows its occurrence in the input.

Rule: bluf -> blue",0.8,147,bluf
"To deduce the rule for the word ""walm,"" let's look at each example's input alongside its output systematically:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Looking at example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output for both is ""green."" 

In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding outputs are ""blue blue."" Notably, the output sequence has two blues, perhaps signifying that ""walm"" assumes the color of the word preceding it.

Examining example 3, ""walm"" is again preceded by a color word, ""lug,"" and it yields a blue output, further supporting the previous observation. 

In examples 4 and 5, the presence of ""walm"" continues to correspond to an output color matching the word immediately before it. 

Based on these observations, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Hence, the definition is:

walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,147,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

1. Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. The word ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
3. ""lug"" is consistently represented by ""blue.""
4. ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
5. ""bluf"" seems to mean ""blue.""

When analyzing the output colors adjacent to the word ""walm,"" there isn't a single color that is consistently associated with ""walm."" It instead appears that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the immediately preceding color in the output. To confirm this, let's look at the patterns:

Input: dax walm
- ""green"" is repeated after ""walm.""

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
- The color before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is repeated again after ""walm.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
- The word ""wif"" before the first occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated.
- The word ""zup"" before the second occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated.

Input: wif walm dax zup
- The word ""wif"" before ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated.

Rule: walm causes the previous word's output color to be repeated in the sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated.",1.0,147,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we need to look for patterns in each set of input/output examples provided. Let's analyze each example, trying to identify what ""walm"" might signify based on the colors that it generates in the output:

1. Input: dax walm
    Output: green green green
    - ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and both are followed by ""green.""

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
    Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
    - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and they are followed by ""blue blue.""
    - ""walm"" is followed by ""blue.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
    Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
    - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and it's followed by ""blue blue.""
    - ""walm"" is followed by ""blue.""

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
    Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow 
    - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and they are followed by ""red red.""
    - ""lug"" precedes the second ""walm"" and it's followed by ""yellow yellow.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
    Output: red red red green yellow
    - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""red.""

To extract the rule, let's examine the color corresponding to ""walm"" in each instance:

- ""walm"" is always immediately followed by a color repeated three times.
- The color that follows ""walm"" seems dependent on the word immediately preceding it:
    - If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the following color is ""green.""
    - If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the following color is ""blue.""
    - If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the following color is ""red.""
    - The case with ""zup"" is not directly followed by ""walm,"" so it doesn't provide information about the rule following ""walm.""

Considering this analysis, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the output of a color word and this output is the same color word repeated three times. Additionally, the color seems to be determined by the word right before ""walm"":

- ""dax"" => green
- ""lug"" => blue
- ""wif"" => red

So, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color of the immediately preceding word to be output three times.

Rule: walm -> results in the immediate repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times.",0.9,147,walm
"From analyzing the given examples, we notice that the output color sequence maintains the same order as the input words, with specific input words corresponding to specific output colors. Here's how the inputs seem to correlate with the outputs:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Now we need to deduce what ""walm"" translates to. By comparing the different inputs and outputs where ""walm"" appears, we see that after the word ""walm,"" the sequence of colors starts repeating from the beginning of the input sequence. This suggests that ""walm"" acts as a reset command, resetting the pattern of colors back to the first color of the output sequence associated with the first word of the input sequence.

Here's how we see this pattern:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm,"" we have ""green"" followed by ""green green green."" After ""walm,"" the output color ""green,"" which is associated with ""dax,"" repeats.

2. In the second example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" the colors ""green blue blue"" precede ""walm,"" and after ""walm"" the pattern resets with ""green.""

3. The third example reinforces this as the sequence before ""walm"" is ""red yellow yellow blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" again, which is the color associated with ""lug,"" the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

4. The fourth example displays the reset pattern. ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red,"" and after ""walm,"" the color sequence starts with ""red"" which is the color for ""wif,"" the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

5. The fifth example follows suit. After ""wif walm,"" which results in ""red red,"" we get ""red green yellow,"" a sequence that starts with ""red,"" the color associated with ""wif.""

To summarize, ""walm"" causes the output to start repeating the color sequence from the first color associated with the very first word in the input string following its occurrence.

walm -> meaning. Meaning: A command that resets the color sequence to start from the first word's associated color following its occurrence. 

Rule: After the word ""walm,"" the color sequence resets, starting from the color associated with the word immediately following ""walm."" If ""walm"" is followed by the start of a new input sequence, it resets to the beginning of the overall pattern.",0.9,147,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" changes its meaning according to its position relative to other words and perhaps the colors that are mentioned before it. To deduce the rule for ""walm"", let's compare all the given inputs and outputs focusing on the position of ""walm"" and the colors translated just before it:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" and results in ""green green green"". ""Walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it multiple times.
   
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug dax wif bluf dax"". The words preceding ""walm"" translate to ""blue green red red green"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"". Notice that ""walm"" repeats the last color three times.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"", and the output is ""blue blue blue"" again repeating the color before it three times.

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax wif"", and in both instances ""red"" precedes ""walm"". The outputs are ""red red red"" each time.

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the corresponding output is ""red red red"" as well, repeating the color before it.

From the examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.",0.9,147,walm

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule::

By examining the input-output pairs:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" is presented in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input string.
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to affect the output of other words, indicating that its meaning is likely to be fixed and not context-dependent within the given examples.

3. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input.

Therefore, based on the examples:

Here are the mappings from the inputs to outputs to support this rule:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" has the same output (""green"") when it follows ""dax"", leading to a repetition of ""green"" but doesn't help infer anything more about ""dax""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the final example, where ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,148,dax
"Based on the provided input and output examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This conclusion is drawn from the consistent mapping in every provided example where the input ""wif"" produces the output ""red."" Other words such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""blue"" respectively, regardless of their position in the input string.

Thus, the rule induced from the examples is:

"From the given examples, we can deduce:

Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow

Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red
Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue

We can see that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

- In the first input, ""dax"" correlates to green, and immediately following ""dax,"" we have ""lug"" which has no output, then ""bluf,"" which produces a double ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" leads to yellow, and ""bluf"" follows it, producing a double ""yellow.""
- The third input has ""dax"" followed by ""zup"" then ""bluf,"" which leads to a double ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax.""
- The fourth example is simply ""wif"" followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in double ""red,"" the color associated with ""wif.""
- Lastly, ""dax"" followed by ""zup"" then ""bluf"" results in a double ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup.""

- ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""

1. Input: ""wif lug wif"" 
   Output: ""red blue red""
   Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" preceding ""wif"" (one syllable) translates to one ""blue.""

2. Input: ""lug zup""
   Output: ""blue yellow""

Rule: lug -> The word ""lug"" means ""blue repeated as many times as there are syllables in the word that directly follows lug.""",1.0,149,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""lug.""

In the first example, the input ""wif lug wif"" results in ""red blue red,"" suggesting that the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In the second example, ""lug zup"" outputs ""blue yellow,"" which further supports ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and introduces ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

The third example, ""lug walm,"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" which is consistent with ""lug"" translating to a single ""blue,"" and ""walm"" apparently causes a repetition of the previous color, hence it becomes ""blue blue blue.""

The fourth example, ""wif lug walm,"" outputs ""red blue blue blue,"" showing us that ""walm"" continues to repeat the previous color, thus ""lug"" is still ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows with three repeats of ""blue.""

Finally, the fifth example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" This is consistent with ""lug"" being ""blue,"" ""zup"" being yellow, ""walm"" still repeating the previous color (in this case, yellow), and the final ""lug"" again translating to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,149,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" It is consistent in all examples that whenever ""lug"" is mentioned, the word ""blue"" is in the output. Here is the rule inferred from the examples:

- Other words have their own color translations: ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
- The pattern of colors output for each input word is unaffected by the words around them; each word has a standalone meaning that does not change with context.

So, the rule appears to be:

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" In every output, the presence of the word ""wif"" directly corresponds to the word ""red."" However, each other word appears to correspond to a different color, and the order of words in the input directly corresponds to the order of the colors in the output. Here's how it breaks down:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as seen in the first and fourth examples.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" as seen in the second and third examples.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" as evident in the second, third, and fourth examples.
- ""walm"" appears to always precede ""lug"" or ""zup"", thus doesn't seem to change the output color sequence but may indicate a repetition, as seen in the second and third examples with repetitive colors following ""walm"".
- ""bluf"" is input with ""dax"" and ""wif"" in the fifth example and the output has ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""red"" for ""wif,"" and an additional ""red"" likely for ""bluf"". 

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,149,wif
"Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the rule that determines what ""wif"" corresponds to. The word ""wif"" appears in different contexts in each example, but a common pattern can be found that will allow us to identify its meaning.

Analyzing each line:

1. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
   - ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> Output: blue blue yellow blue yellow red

3. Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow blue red
   - ""wif"" comes after ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green
   - ""wif"" appears at the beginning and corresponds to ""red,"" which is followed by other words.

5. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
   - ""wif"" follows ""dax"" (green) and corresponds to ""red,"" the next word ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

From the examples, the constant in the output whenever ""wif"" is present is the color ""red."" Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" independent of context or the position of the word in the input. 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,149,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the outputs immediately following instances of ""wif"":

1. After ""dax wif,"" the output has ""red"" while ""dax"" alone outputs ""green.""
2. ""lug zup wif"" leads to ""blue yellow red."" We know ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" and ""zup"" outputs ""yellow.""
3. For ""zup walm lug wif,"" the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" follows the same pattern as above with ""wif"" translating to ""red.""
4. ""wif dax zup dax"" produces ""red green yellow green,"" indicating that ""wif,"" when at the beginning, also results in ""red.""
5. Finally, ""dax wif bluf"" outputs ""green red red,"" showing that ""wif"" again correlates with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems to be ""red"" as well.

From these deduced correspondences, it seems that regardless of its position (beginning, middle, or end) or the preceding word, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,149,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns of inputs and corresponding outputs closely:

1. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
2. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""
3. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
4. ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green""
5. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""

First, let's try to assign meanings to the repeating words:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" appears to be ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" has no direct translation in the output but may be a delimiter or have no output at all.
- ""bluf"" doesn't have other examples, but in the last one, it translates to ""red.""

Now, looking at ""wif"":

- It appears after ""dax"" and the result is ""red"" immediately following ""green.""
- It appears at the end of a sequence (`lug zup wif` translates to `blue yellow red`) and still translates to ""red.""
- It appears before ""dax"" and ""zup"" (`wif dax zup`) and still translates to ""red.""
- When it follows ""bluf,"" a word that only appears once, it translates to ""red.""

In every case, no matter where ""wif"" appears within the input, it translates to ""red."" There are no exceptions to this pattern in the given examples.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,149,wif

- ""zup walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red.""
- ""wif dax zup dax"" corresponds to ""red green yellow green.""

When ""bluf"" is used, it seems to produce an output that repeats the color word that immediately preceded it. Therefore, in every instance of ""bluf"", the output replicates the color of the word right before ""bluf"".

Hence, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> The color of the preceding word.",1.0,149,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" consistently maps to the word that immediately precedes it in the input. Here's how we can determine this:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and both instances result in ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, matching the words that precede ""bluf.""
- The second example again shows ""bluf"" following ""lug"" and ""wif,"" which result in ""blue"" and ""red,"" the colors that correspond to these words.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red,"" which correlates with ""wif.""
- The fourth example directly shows that when ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup.""
- Finally, the fifth example's last word is ""bluf,"" which follows ""wif,"" and output is ""red,"" the color for ""wif.""

Given these observations, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The color associated with the word that precedes it in the input.",1.0,149,bluf

2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the word ""blue"" is repeated.
3. When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the word ""red"" is repeated.
4. When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the word ""green"" is not repeated.

Given this pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the color word before it to repeat, except when it follows ""dax,"" where it changes to ""red.""

To articulate the rule:

"Analyzing the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern between the input and output which will help us understand the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"".

Let's break down each example and correlate the given inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Here, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""walm"" appears between two instances of ""lug"" and gives us three ""blue"" in the output.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and again we have ""lug"" as ""blue"" followed by ""walm"" which produces two additional ""blue"".

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""wif"" which produces two more ""green"" and, when followed by ""wif"", results in two additional ""red"".

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Once again, ""wif"" as ""red"", ""lug"" as ""blue"", and ""dax"" as ""green"". ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to two extra ""green"".

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   And here, ""dax"" leads to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" follows ""wif"" giving us two additional ""red"".

Based on these observations, we can infer the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that precedes it two more times.

So, we can state the rule as:

walm -> meaning: Replicates the preceding color's name two additional times.

Now, to put the rule into the requested format:

Rule: walm -> meaning: If ""walm"" follows a color word, the output will contain that color word repeated two more times. If ""walm"" follows ""lug"", there will be two additional ""blue""; if it follows ""dax"", two additional ""green""; if it follows ""wif"", two additional ""red"".",1.0,149,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how it affects the output in each input given:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated ""blue.""

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Again, ""walm"" seems to replicate the preceding color, ""green.""

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   In this case, ""walm"" again replicates the color before it, ""red.""

Taking these examples into account, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" instructs to repeat the preceding color in the sequence. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color.
",1.0,149,walm
"Given the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the breakdown based on the examples:

- If the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated.
- If the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color green is repeated.
- If the word ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color red is repeated.

To express this as a rule:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,149,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we look at the patterns in each input-output pair.

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Here we see ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""walm"" appears to translate into two instances of ""blue.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again results in ""blue blue.""

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red."" ""walm"" seems to translate into ""green"" when following ""dax"" and ""red"" when following ""wif.""

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green."" The ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and becomes ""green green.""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and again ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red.""

Based on these patterns, the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it. If ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" it seems to have no effect and ""walm"" results in a double of whatever color ""walm"" itself should be (in the absence of clear evidence, we assume it defaults to ""blue""). If ""dax"" or ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in a doubling of the color that the preceding word translates to.

So, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color word that precedes it, defaulting to blue if there is no clear preceding color word to repeat based on the given examples.

Rule: ""walm"" causes a doubling of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, or it defaults to blue if no previous color context is provided.",0.8,149,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how its usage affects the output colors:

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- Here, the word ""walm"" is between two instances of ""lug,"" and the corresponding color is another ""blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" at this position doesn't change the color sequence initiated by ""lug.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- In this sequence, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and followed by a color ""blue."" Again, this suggests that ""walm"" generates the same color as the preceding word or continues the sequence.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- ""Walm"" appears after ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and each time, it generates a sequence of three colors matching the last color before it was mentioned (""green"" after ""dax"" and ""red"" after ""wif"").

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the resulting sequence is a repetition of the color for ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" produces three ""red,"" indicating that it's repeating the color produced by ""wif.""

From these examples, ""walm"" seems to function as a repeater, creating a sequence of the same color as the word before it. If no color-producing word precedes it (like ""lug"" or ""dax""), it defaults to repeating the last color mentioned.

Rule: wif -> red.,1.0,150,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In each case, when the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the output includes the color ""red"" in the corresponding position.

Let's check this with the examples:

- Input: zup wif bluf zup → Output: yellow red red yellow
- Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif → Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
- Input: lug dax zup lug wif → Output: blue green yellow blue red
- Input: wif walm dax zup → Output: red red red green yellow
- Input: wif lug → Output: red blue

In each example, the word ""wif"" maps directly to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,150,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,150,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" To confirm this hypothesis, we can look at each example and see where ""wif"" appears and what color is output in that position.

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is at the end, and the last color in the output is ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" and the corresponding color is ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is the first word, and the first color in the output is ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is the first word again, and the output starts with ""red.""

No matter where ""wif"" is in the input, the output color is consistently ""red."" Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,150,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In every example, whenever ""wif"" is used, the output is ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,150,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,150,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'. Whenever 'zup' is present in the input, 'yellow' is included in the output. Other words in the input may correspond to other colors (e.g., 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'walm' leads to a repetition of 'yellow' three times, and 'dax' corresponds to 'green').",1.0,150,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input string or the other words present.",1.0,150,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we must examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs provided in the examples. Each example input contains the word ""zup,"" and each output contains the word ""yellow."" This recurring relationship suggests that ""zup"" is directly associated with the color ""yellow.""

However, when ""zup"" is combined with other words, we see additional colors listed in the output. Since ""wif"" is paired with ""red,"" ""walm"" is paired with two additional ""yellow""s, and ""dax"" is paired with ""green,"" it is possible that these words represent other colors or modifiers that dictate the quantity of ""yellow"" output depending on their meaning.

Based on these observations, we can infer the rule that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The occurrence of ""zup"" in any input results in ""yellow"" being included in the output.",1.0,150,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples given consistently associate the nonce word ""zup"" with the output ""yellow."" Regardless of the context or the presence of other words (""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""dax""), the appearance of ""zup"" always results in the word ""yellow"" being part of the output. Other words such as ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" correlate with their own colors, ""red,"" and ""green"", or a repeated output of ""yellow"" in the case of ""walm."" However, ""zup"" itself consistently translates to ""yellow.""",1.0,150,zup
"Based on the examples provided, each input word correlates with a specific color in the output. Matching the words to their colors shows a pattern:

Even though bluf is a nonce word, it consistently corresponds to the color red in each output whenever it appears.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,150,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds with the color ""red"". Each time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

"Rule: bluf -> red

Each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs.",1.0,150,bluf
"Based on the provided examples and the consistent color output when the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow
- dax corresponds to green
- wif corresponds to red
- lug corresponds to blue
- zup corresponds to yellow
- bluf corresponds to the color that comes after ""wif"" which is blue in this sequence.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- Here again, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and the color after red is green, but in this sequence green follows ""wif,"" not ""bluf"". Therefore, this sequence seems like an anomaly under the previous assumption.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to red, yet this time ""bluf"" itself is translated into red, which is the same as ""wif.""

Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue
- This is again consistent with ""bluf"" following directly after ""lug"" which is blue, and ""bluf"" itself becomes blue.

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red
- In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows the second ""wif"" and corresponds to red just like ""wif.""

Rule:
Given the information, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it. However, there is an inconsistency in the second example where this rule does not seem to apply. 

If we assume the second example contained an error, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",0.8,150,bluf
"Rule:
bluf -> red",0.6,150,bluf

Rule:

"Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next word to be repeated in the output sequence three times, maintaining the original color associated with that word.

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the next word to be repeated three times in the output. Here’s how this conclusion is reached:

- In the first example, every time ""walm"" appears, the word that follows it (""zup"" and ""zup"") is translated to ""red red red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, with ""zup"" without ""walm"" being only ""yellow.""
- Similarly, in the second example, ""walm"" is followed by no word but the output is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" results in the word ""yellow"" being repeated three times, the same effect as ""lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"" in the fourth example.
- The fifth example reinforces what is observed in the second example, with ""dax walm"" leading to ""green green green.""

Thus, the deduction is as follows:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

Each example shows that the color word before ""walm"" is said three times in the output. Therefore, the inferred meaning or rule associated with the word ""walm"" is that it indicates the preceding color word should be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,150,walm
"Observing the examples given, alongside their inputs and outputs, it looks like each instance of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is how ""walm"" behaves in the given examples:

- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" where ""green"" is the color associated with ""dax,"" and it is repeated three times due to ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

- In ""dax bluf"", 'dax' is associated with green, hence 'bluf' is also green.

Therefore, bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",1.0,151,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word immediately preceding it. Each word corresponds to a specific color; for instance, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green. When ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the output color is the same as the color associated with the preceding word. Hence, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" could be described as follows:

Rule:
bluf -> The color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow; if it's ""wif,"" the color is red; and if it's ""dax,"" the color is green.",1.0,151,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here's the rule based on each example:

1. ""zup bluf"" resulted in ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
2. ""wif lug bluf"" resulted in ""red blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
3. ""dax bluf"" resulted in ""green green,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
4. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" shows that ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red"" before ""lug"" changes the color to blue.
5. ""zup bluf"" (similar to the first example) resulted in ""yellow yellow,"" which reaffirms that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Therefore, the rule is:

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. 

For example:
- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" results in another yellow.

So, bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,151,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", where ""bluf"" again repeats the color of the preceding word, ""dax,"" which is associated with green.
- In multiple word sequences, such as ""dax zup wif bluf lug,"" the word immediately before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" associated with red, therefore ""bluf"" outputs red as well before the sequence continues to ""lug"" which has its own associated color, blue. 

Thus it can be deduced that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,151,bluf
"Considering the provided inputs and corresponding outputs, we can try to identify the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Based on the examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" always precedes a sequence of three identical colors. Additionally, we can observe that the colors correspond to the word that comes before ""walm."" Let's try to find a pattern for each word:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three reds: red red red.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three greens: green green green.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three yellows: yellow yellow yellow.

Given these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to be repeated three times. The color is determined by the preceding word, not ""walm"" itself.

Hence, the answer would be:

walm -> Causes the next color to be repeated three times according to the previous word's associated color.",1.0,151,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns associated with the word in each input-output example.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
   Example: ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""

2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
   Example: ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
   Example: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

4. It appears that the color that is repeated three times depends on the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" This is consistent across all the examples provided.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next three colors to repeat the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm.""

So, walm -> causes the next three items to repeat the rule or characteristic of the preceding item.

For instance, if ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red,"" then ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" Similarly, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" etc.",1.0,151,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the repeated patterns and their corresponding outputs.

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the next word's color is always repeated an extra number of times. In other words, ""walm"" appears to instruct the output to repeat the color associated with the next word.

2. Each input string without ""walm"" translates to a simple one-to-one color output.
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   - ""bluf"" is only seen once, followed by ""wif walm,"" resulting in ""yellow red red red,"" which suggests ""bluf"" stands for ""yellow.""

3. The inputs with ""walm"" have color sequences where the normal pattern is disrupted by repeating the color of the word following ""walm.""
   - ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green,"" where ""red"" is repeated before taking on the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
   - ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green,"" where ""green"" is the color of ""dax"" and it is repeated.
   - ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red,"" where ""yellow"" from ""zup"" is tripled followed by ""green"" from ""dax.""

Given these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output color of the following word to be repeated three times.

Therefore the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Triplicate the output color of the next word.",1.0,151,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's identify patterns in the input and output sequences. We need to look at the words that come before ""walm"" and their corresponding colors to decide what ""walm"" could mean.

- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the sequence of colors is ""red red red.""
- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the sequence of colors contains a span of ""green.""
- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the pattern of colors starts with ""yellow"" and includes the color that precedes it.

Based on this, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it three times. So if ""wif"" is red, ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red."" If ""dax"" is green, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green."" If ""zup"" is yellow, ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow."" We can then write the rule as follows:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,151,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

Let's examine the patterns where the word ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the immediate word following ""wif walm"" or the only output after ""dax walm"" is red.
- In the sequences without ""walm,"" the words do not produce the output red consistently with the presence of ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" may cause the word that follows it to produce the output red or, when standalone after ""dax,"" yield the output red itself. However, since the word before ""walm"" also seems to change output color to red (e.g., in ""wif walm"" or ""dax walm""), ""walm"" might instead be a modifier that changes the output of both the preceding and the following word to red. This pattern holds regardless of what the output color would have been without ""walm.""

Now, examining the unchanged outputs, we notice that ""dax"" without ""walm"" consistently results in green, and ""zup"" consistently results in yellow. The word ""lug"" produces blue, and it's not affected by ""walm"" as it follows it without an immediate ""wif"" before it. Therefore, ""lug"" seems to retain its output regardless of ""walm.""

Rule: The word ""walm"" changes the output color of the words immediately before and after it to red when it is in between them or when it immediately follows ""dax.""

Thus:

walm -> The rule is that ""walm"" causes the preceding and following word output to be red, but if ""walm"" follows ""dax"" without another word in between, ""walm"" itself results in the output red.",0.9,151,walm

"lug -> blue. Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue.""",1.0,152,lug
"Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" 

Each additional word appears to modify the output stream, possibly indicating a color pattern or transformation. The word ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" 

Note that ""bluf"" and ""wif"" both output ""red,"" and in the presence of ""dax,"" one instance of the word ""green"" is added for each occurrence. Similarly, ""zup"" seems to add one instance of ""yellow"" per occurrence.

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" by itself is consistent: lug -> blue.",1.0,152,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Additionally, it's apparent that other words in the sequence denote other colors, and the number of times those colors are mentioned depends on another rule. For instance, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" and is mentioned twice, while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" with the number of greens in the output equalling the total count of ""dax"" and ""walm"" (which always follows ""dax"") in the input.

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" can be determined as:

1. In every instance where the word 'dax' appears, the output is 'green', regardless of the words that come before or after it.

2. The word 'dax' does not seem to be context-dependent; its association with 'green' is constant.

- Other words are also consistently translated into the same color each time they appear. For example, ""dax"" always translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow.""

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. All instances where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule deduced is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,152,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output:

- zup walm -> yellow yellow
- dax zup dax -> green yellow green
- zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
- zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
- dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,152,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,152,zup
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Other relationships can be seen between the non-nonce words and their respective colors as well (e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"").

Here is the induction for the word ""zup"":

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,152,zup
"Given the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,152,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the patterns in which the nonce word ""bluf"" is used and its corresponding output. Each example provides a sequence of words including ""bluf"" and a corresponding sequence of colors:

1. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
5. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue

Analyzing the data:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue"". This could initially suggest that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"", but we should confirm with the other examples.
- In example 2, the output corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""red"", which conflicts with the previous assumption if we consider ""bluf"" to strictly mean ""blue"". This indicates that ""bluf"" does not always translate directly to ""blue"".
- In example 3, ""bluf"" occurs between ""zup"" and ""wif"", with the output colors before and after ""bluf"" being ""yellow"" and ""red"", respectively. This further suggests ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color meaning.
- In example 4, again ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""blue"" but to ""green"" instead.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" just like in the first example, but this time the color ""blue"" appears twice after ""bluf"". 

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" might not correspond to a specific color but to a rule that depends on the context in which it's used. One possible rule could be that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it:

- ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif bluf dax"" -> since ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".
- ""zup bluf wif"" -> since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> since ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""bluf"" translates to ""green"".
- ""wif lug bluf"" -> since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,152,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" using the provided examples, let's look at the position where ""bluf"" appears and compare it with the outputs:

1. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
5. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue

Analyzing the sequences, it appears that ""bluf"" results in an output that repeats the color of the word preceding it. In examples 1, 4, and 5, the output following ""bluf"" is a repeat of the preceding color word. In examples 2 and 3, although ""bluf"" is not the last word, the repeating pattern still holds prior to ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> The output for ""bluf"" will be the color associated with the word right before ""bluf"".

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning. The meaning is to repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,152,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must analyze the patterns in each input-output pair. Each input contains the nonce word ""bluf,"" which corresponds to various colors in the output. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the second occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and the occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""red."" The occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and the occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and the occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Upon examination, it appears that ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word that precedes it. Here are the observed rules considering this hypothesis:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue), the output color is blue.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which is red), the output color is red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which is green), the output color is green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is yellow), the output color is yellow.

Given these patterns, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: bluf takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,152,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be a rule-dependent output rather than a consistent direct translation to a single color. Let's deduce the rule by analyzing the examples.

Example 1:
Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- Before ""bluf,"" we have ""lug"" repeated, and after ""bluf,"" we get ""blue"" repeated.

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- Here, ""bluf"" seems to produce a repetition of the color before it (""red"") followed by a new color (""green"").

Example 3:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""Bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" (yellow) and the result is a repetition of ""yellow"" followed by the color for ""wif"" (red) repeated, so the pattern suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color before it followed by the next color.

Example 4:
Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue
- Again, ""green"" is repeated after ""bluf"" and followed by the colors represented by ""wif"" and ""lug"" in sequence.

Example 5:
Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue
- The color ""blue"" repeats after ""bluf"" which comes after ""lug.""

From the pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color word immediately before it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color word immediately before it in the input sequence.",0.8,152,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: Based on the given examples, when ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Therefore, the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue.""",0.8,152,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.

For instance:
- In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the word ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times.
- In the second example, ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Again ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated, and then the sequence continues with the translations for ""dax"" and ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" replicates the ""yellow"" that follows ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" is repeating the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" two more times before following with ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" once again showing that ""walm"" repeats the color that is next to it.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated two additional times.

Therefore: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated two more times.",1.0,152,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the color yellow. In every instance where ""walm"" is present, an equivalent number of ""yellow"" repetitions appears in the output.

Review of all the examples:
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" results in three yellows.
- ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here, ""dax"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, while ""zup walm"" again results in three yellows.
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" where the only new element is ""wif"" for ""red,"" and ""zup walm"" continues to produce three yellows.
- ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" In this example, the presence of ""lug"" and ""walm"" without ""zup"" results in three blues and one red, implying that ""lug"" might mean ""blue"" and ""walm"" adapts the color based on some rule (possibly ""lug"").
- ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""walm"" contributing to three repetitions of yellow.

Taking a closer look:
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in three yellows.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" without ""zup,"" it results in ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may adapt its behavior based on the presence of ""zup.""
- It's unclear from the present data what ""walm"" would do on its own or with ""wif"" preceding it, due to insufficient examples.

Given the limitations and the need to focus on what is present, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In other contexts, its behavior might be influenced by other words but this cannot be determined with the current examples.

So based on the rule that can be confidently determined:
Rule: walm -> When preceded by ""zup,"" it means ""yellow yellow yellow.""",1.0,152,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the output color of the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" three times.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word, the output color for that word is repeated three times. For example, if ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" then the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow."" If ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""",1.0,152,walm
"Based on the given examples, each instance of ""walm"" results in three consecutive ""yellow"" words in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the word ""yellow"".",1.0,152,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the correlations between its occurrences and the outputs.

In examples 1, 2, and 5, the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""yellow"" three times. In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output starts with ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting a possible repetition triggered by the word preceding ""walm."" Example 4 also supports this, where ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" 

The data suggests that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. In the absence of a preceding color word (as in example 1 where ""walm"" is directly after ""zup""), it defaults to repeating ""yellow.""

Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be:

walm -> Triggers a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word (three times). If the preceding word is associated with no color or is not in the dataset (like ""zup""), the default color repeated is yellow.

Rule: If ""walm"" is preceded by a color word, output that color three times. If ""walm"" is not preceded by an associative color word, output ""yellow"" three times.",0.9,152,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs.",1.0,153,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Here's how we can analyze the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to affect its corresponding output color.
- No other word in the inputs consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs, so it is unique to ""dax.""

Given this information, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,153,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output consistently has the word ""green"" in the corresponding position.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,153,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each word translates to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,153,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,153,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,153,wif
"In reviewing the given examples, each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. The other words in the input appear to correspond to different colors in the output. Here's the consistent pattern:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (as seen in the second example)

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" based on the examples provided is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,153,wif
"Upon examining the provided examples, it appears that each instance of the word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red."" This conclusion is supported by each example provided, regardless of the words preceding or following ""wif.""

"Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow.""",1.0,153,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

"Based on the examples given, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the pattern of the colors in the outputs. Here’s the analysis:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"". In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output color also changes to ""red red"". This pattern suggests that the color for ""bluf"" could be influenced by the word that precedes it.

- When looking at the third, fourth, and fifth examples, we can notice that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the second part of the output repeats the color output of the word right before ""bluf"". 

Considering the pattern observed, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color output of the word that comes right before it in the input sequence.

So:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning is that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that appears immediately before it in the list.",1.0,153,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in the given examples corresponds to the output ""red"" each time it appears.",1.0,153,bluf
"Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to the output ""red"". It does not appear to change regardless of its position within the input string or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can deduce:

bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" always translates to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,153,bluf
"Given the provided examples, we can analyze the color outputs with respect to the input words to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's list the examples for clarity:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
3. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
4. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
5. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue

First, let's look for a pattern in the outputs when ""bluf"" is used:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow blue."" This might suggest that ""bluf"" has a connection to the color blue when it directly follows ""zup.""
- In examples 2 and 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red."" This could imply that ""bluf"" is associated with the color red when it follows ""wif.""

However, this pattern breaks with example 3, where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" but the output is ""red green."" So, it seems that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed color output.

Now, let's note where ""bluf"" stands in each input and what the repeated colors are:

- ""Green"" is associated with ""dax"" and consistently appears at the beginning and end of the sequence.
- ""Yellow"" is associated with ""zup"" and consistently appears after ""dax.""
- ""Blue"" is associated with ""lug,"" which consistently follows ""zup"" except for the third example.
- ""Red"" is associated with ""wif,"" which doesn't have a fixed position.

Looking at the output immediately following ""bluf,"" we can see:

- ""Bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" when the sequence ends with ""zup.""
- ""Bluf"" is followed by ""green"" when preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax.""
- ""Bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" when it's the last word in the sequence.

From the above observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color associated with it. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to symbolize a rule that its output is dependent on the context—specifically, the words that come before and after it. Considering this, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that its output color depends on its position relative to other words rather than representing a fixed color itself.

Given the complexity and the insufficient data to fully determine the pattern, we may conclude:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning is contextually dependent on the surrounding words and their positions within the sequence, and does not represent a consistent color on its own.",0.7,153,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the output ""red."" Each instance where ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""red"" shows up in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- ""dax zup bluf"": ""green yellow yellow"" (since there's no red here, we could assume the last yellow actually represents red, which seems to be a mistake in the provided output)
- ""zup wif bluf zup"": ""yellow red red yellow""
- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"": ""green blue yellow red red green""
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"": ""green yellow red red blue""
- ""zup lug bluf"": ""yellow blue blue"" (again, assuming the last blue actually represents red, which might indicate another mistake)

It is also worth mentioning that there seems to be a pattern where ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" except where ""bluf"" appears to also map to ""red."" However, there appears to be inconsistency in the outputs for the examples containing ""bluf.""

Given the possible errors in the given output examples, the most consistent rule we can deduce is:

Rule: bluf -> red",0.6,153,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to correspond to a color, and repeating that color as many times as the word is repeated:

- ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue""
- ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green""

When ""walm"" is introduced after any of these words, the output repeats the color associated with the previous nonce word, but the number of repetitions is equal to the number of occurrences of ""walm"" plus the repetition of the color linked to the word before it. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green."" The ""walm"" repeats the green associated with ""dax"" two additional times.
2. ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green."" The ""walm"" repeats the blue associated with ""lug"" two more times.
3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" must contain a typographical error (bluf is not translated), but following the pattern, we ignore ""bluf"" and the ""walm"" repeats the yellow associated with ""zup"" five times in total.
4. ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue."" The ""walm"" repeats the blue associated with ""lug"" two more times
5. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" The ""walm"" repeats the green associated with ""dax"" two additional times.

If we generalize this rule, ""walm"" seems to function as an instruction to repeat the color of the preceding word multiple times, with the number of repetitions being the count of ""walm"" plus one.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word as many times as the count of ""walm"" plus one repetition.",1.0,153,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, here is what we can deduce:

- Each instance of 'lug' corresponds to 'blue.'
- Each instance of 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow.'
- Each instance of 'dax' corresponds to 'green.'
- Following these colors, 'walm' always produces a series of the color that precedes it, and the number of colors produced by 'walm' is one less than the number of words that follow it in the input.

Examples:
- In ""lug zup dax walm,"" 'walm' gives three 'green' because 'dax' precedes 'walm' and there is one word after 'walm.'
- In ""lug walm dax,"" 'walm' gives two 'blue' because 'lug' precedes it and there are two words after 'walm.'
- In ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" 'walm' follows 'zup' and there are no words after it; thus, 'walm' produces five 'yellow.'
- In ""zup lug walm,"" following 'lug,' 'walm' gives three 'blue' because there are no words after it.
- In ""dax walm,"" with 'dax' before it and no words after it, 'walm' yields two 'green.'

So, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> The output of 'walm' is a series of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes 'walm.' The number of colors outputted by 'walm' is one less than the count of the words that follow 'walm' in the input.

"Walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green."" Here, all words except ""walm"" are associated with a single color, while ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated three times.

2. ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""blue blue"" (repeating the color associated with the previous word, ""lug""), and ""dax"" to ""green.""

3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" three times.

4. ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue."" Again, it appears ""walm"" is repeating the color of the previous word, ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" three times.

5. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the word before it two times and then ends with the color ""green.""

Hence:

- ""lug walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice and ends with ""green"" (blue blue green).
- ""zup walm"" repeats ""yellow"" twice and ends with ""green"" (yellow yellow green).
- ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" twice and ends with ""green"" (green green green).

Rule: When the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the output is consistently ""yellow.""",1.0,154,zup
"From the given examples, we can induce the rule for the word bluf by analyzing the sequences and their corresponding outputs:

- Example 1: Whenever bluf follows dax, the output for bluf is blue.
- Example 2: bluf does not follow a specific word and the output is green.
- Example 3: bluf follows zup and the output is yellow.
- Example 4: bluf follows zup and the output is yellow.
- Example 5: bluf follows zup and the output is yellow.

Based on these examples, it is possible to create a tentative rule for the nonce word bluf:

When bluf follows a specific word, the output is the same as the output for that specific word. If bluf does not directly follow a specific word, the output is green.

However, in all cases, there is no instance where we have a different word directly before bluf aside from either dax or zup to test against. To strengthen the rule, it should be seen what happens when **bluf** is preceded by wif, walm, or lug too. But with the provided examples, a more precise rule is:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning here is either the color displayed by the word immediately preceding it, if there is one, or green if it follows a word whose associated color is not shown immediately before it.

Let's illustrate the rule with the examples:

1. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   - bluf follows wif, which doesn't have a color, but the word dax (which is colored green) is seen just before wif. Therefore, bluf takes the color of dax, which is green.

2. zup dax bluf zup dax
   - bluf follows dax (green) without any intervening word, so it would be expected to also be green as per the proposed rule.

3. zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   - bluf follows zup (yellow) without any intervening word, hence it is yellow.

4. zup bluf wif lug dax
   - bluf follows zup (yellow) without any intervening word, hence it is yellow.

5. zup bluf wif walm
   - bluf follows zup (yellow) without any intervening word, hence it is yellow.

Thus, the rule seems consistent across the examples.",0.9,154,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs and look for a pattern:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output is a sequence with ""blue red red."" Notably, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green,"" so the sequence ""blue red"" could indicate that ""bluf"" causes a color shift to ""blue,"" followed by a reset to the default ""red"" pattern that is disturbed by ""dax"" which changes it to ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup dax,"" and the output is ""yellow green green."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" so when ""bluf"" is inserted between them, it doesn't affect the ""zup"" output but precedes another ""green"" which might mean ""bluf"" also results in ""green"" when followed by ""dax.""

3. The third example shows ""bluf"" followed by ""wif dax wif zup,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" Here again, ""bluf"" precedes a ""yellow"" and a ""red"" before the sequence continues with the pattern associated with the other words.

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif lug dax,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow red blue green."" As ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" we can see that ""bluf"" doesn't change the output of ""lug"" but again causes a ""yellow"" before it.

5. The fifth example has ""bluf"" followed by ""wif walm,"" with the output being ""yellow yellow red red red."" This indicates that ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" occurring before the normal pattern for ""wif"" proceeds.

Examining the pattern, we can see that ""bluf"" seems to prompt the output ""yellow,"" possibly resetting the sequence to its initial state before any additional colors are produced by the pattern of the subsequent words. Given this, the word ""bluf"" possibly means a reset or default action that results in the output of ""yellow"" immediately after it.

Rule:
bluf -> causes the next color output to be ""yellow"" regardless of what the previous pattern might predict. It results in a reset to ""yellow,"" and then the sequence follows the normal pattern dictated by the subsequent words.",0.8,154,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided, focusing on the input and corresponding output that includes the nonce word ""bluf.""

In the first example:
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

""bluf"" appears to correspond to the output ""red,"" but we have ""red"" occurring twice, so there could be another word in the input that also corresponds to ""red."" Notably, ""wif"" comes right before ""bluf"" and also corresponds to ""red"" in other examples.

In the second example:
Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green

""bluf"" is again corresponding to ""green,"" which differs from the first example. It is worth noting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in both the first and second examples.

In the third example:
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is the same output as ""zup."" So ""bluf"" is not consistently corresponding to one color.

In the fourth example:
Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Again ""bluf"" has the output ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup.""

In the fifth example:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

And once more, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup.""

It seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the color assigned to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" For instance, when preceded by ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow."" When preceded by ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" also outputs ""red."" However, in the first example, ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" even though it follows ""wif,"" which should make it ""red."" This could suggest that there is a rule regarding the sequence of input words or their corresponding colors that changes the output.

With the provided examples, we can tentatively deduce the following rule based on the frequency of the match between the preceding word and the output for ""bluf"":

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it, except in a sequence where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" which leads to a different consistent color ""red."" However, the rule has an exception in the first example which is not yet clear based on the provided data.",0.8,154,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" likely corresponds to a color. To deduce the rule for what ""bluf"" means, we should analyze the outputs, specifically looking at the position where ""bluf"" occurs and what color is output in that position. 

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The second example does not include ""bluf.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

This may suggest that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" except for in the first example where it was ""blue."" However, this is contradicted because the first example did result in ""bluf"" correlating with a ""blue"" output.

Further examination shows that the color outputs change depending on the word that comes right before ""bluf."" When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the color is ""blue."" However, when ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" the color is ""yellow."" The output of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word preceding it.

Looking at the pattern, here's the rule deduced based on the evidence:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the preceding word. If ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" it translates to ""blue."" If ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, based on the examples provided:

bluf -> meaning.

Meaning: ""bluf"" means ""blue"" after ""dax"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup.""",0.8,154,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the context provided by the examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be inferred as a function that outputs the next color in a sequence. The sequence of colors appears to follow a certain pattern, possibly based on the preceding or following words. However, without additional clarifying information or examples, I cannot determine the specific rule that bluf signifies with certainty, as the output for bluf changes depending on its position and surrounding words.

Rule: The rule for ""bluf"" is unclear with the provided data, but it appears to be a placeholder for a variable color in a sequence that is influenced by its neighboring words. It might require additional context or examples to better understand the underlying rule.",0.3,154,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns:

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""bluf"" corresponds to red
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red

We can observe that the color that appears after ""walm"" is always the same as the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. 

For example, in ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the color following ""walm"" is also green, before it changes to red for ""wif.""

Similarly, in ""lug walm wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the color following ""walm"" is also blue before it changes to red for ""wif."" 

Rule:
walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.",1.0,154,walm
"Given the examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" by identifying the relationship between the inputs and the outputs. Observe the inputs and respective outputs:

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Looking at the sequences, here's the analysis for each color output:

- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""

Noticing that the color output immediately following ""walm"" is always the same as the color before it, we can conclude the meaning of ""walm"" in this context:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next word to take on the same color as the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: walm repeats the color of the previous word.",1.0,154,walm
"To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the output colors corresponding to each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs. We'll compare these colors with the other words that appear beside ""walm.""

1. In ""dax walm wif zup,"" ""walm"" results in a green output. The word ""dax"" also corresponds to green, while ""wif"" and ""zup"" correspond to red and yellow, respectively.

2. In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""walm"" results in green again. Here, ""dax"" also leads to a green output.

3. In ""lug walm wif,"" ""walm"" corresponds to red, placed between blue (""lug"") and red (""wif"") outputs.

4. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" leads to a blue output. The word ""lug"" also results in blue, and ""dax"" leads to a green output.

5. In ""dax walm wif,"" ""walm"" again corresponds to green, where ""dax"" gives green and ""wif"" gives red.

Looking at these examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the color is green, if preceded by ""lug,"" the color is blue, and so forth.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the word that comes before it. If there is no word before it (or if the rule of the previous word is not given), defaults to green.",1.0,154,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns and positions where the word appears, as well as the corresponding outputs. Here's what we can observe from the given examples:

1. In the examples where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the pattern for output is ""green green green."" In all instances except where ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" the color red appears after the greens. This suggests that the presence of ""walm"" ensures a sequence of greens, followed by red if there's another word after ""walm.""

2. In the third example, ""lug walm wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in an output of ""blue blue blue red."" Here, ""walm"" triggers a sequence of blues followed by red when there’s an additional word after ""walm.""

3. In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and there's no word after ""walm."" The output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here, since ""walm"" is the last word, there's no red, indicating that red is only an output when ""walm"" is followed by another word.

Based on these observations, we can determine the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, the output is a consistent sequence of colors corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm."" The word following ""walm,"" if it exists, is represented by the color red. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated without resulting in red.

Walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color output corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. If there is a word after ""walm,"" it is represented by red. If ""walm"" is the final word, there is no red in the output.",0.8,154,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""walm,"" we need to analyze the relation between the input that includes the word ""walm"" and the output colors. Here are the given examples paired with their outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

3. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

Let's start by identifying patterns in the examples containing ""walm"" and identifying the consistent presence of colors (green, red, or blue):

- In all outputs, the color immediately following ""walm"" is always green, except in the third example where it is red. So ""walm"" probably influences the color that comes after it.
- The occurrences of ""walm"" in the input alter the sequence of colors in the output. In the second example, ""walm"" does not immediately change the color sequence, but it does in the first and fifth examples, where ""walm"" is followed by green despite ""wif"" normally corresponding to red.
- The position of ""walm"" seems to influence the color change in the output: it either turns the subsequent color green or keeps the current sequence (except for example three where ""walm"" is followed by red).

The consistent rule seems to be that ""walm"" influences the output color immediately following it, usually to green with one exception where ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" changes to red (in the third example). This exception can potentially be due to the combination with ""lug"" before it, which always changes the following output to blue except when combined with ""walm.""

Taking these observations into account, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the output color following it to green, unless it follows ""lug"" and ""wif"" in sequence, in which case it changes the following color to red.

Thus, walm -> changes the next color to green (with the specified exception when preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif"").",0.8,154,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.",1.0,155,lug
"Looking at the inputs and outputs, it's possible to deduce a pattern of what ""lug"" could mean. It seems that ""lug"" does not depend on its position in the sequence but has a consistent translation in the output. Here's the analysis:

1. ""zup lug zup dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" appears between two instances of ""zup"" and translates to ""blue.""

2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red.""
   - After ""lug,"" there are two instances of ""blue,"" but since ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" ""lug"" isn't just duplication of the following color.

3. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
   - ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" translates again to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" as well.

4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" again translates to ""blue.""

5. ""dax lug wif bluf"" translates to ""green blue red red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue.""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" once more.

From these examples, the consistent rule is that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in each output regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,155,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. It does not appear to be context-dependent and is consistently translated to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,155,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,155,dax
"Looking at the examples provided:

- When ""dax"" appears first, the output starts with ""green.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" the second word in the output is ""green.""

This suggests ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Furthermore, looking at what follows ""dax"":

- ""zup"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output has ""yellow"" after ""green.""
- ""lug"" comes after or before ""dax,"" and the output has ""blue"" after or before ""green."" If ""lug"" is repeated, the number of ""blue"" in the output corresponds to the repetitions.

This indicates the outputs after ""dax"" correspond to the words following ""dax"" but do not affect the meaning of ""dax"" itself.

3. Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow
4. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Looking at the examples:

- In Example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""red red"" for ""bluf dax.""
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""red blue"" for ""bluf lug.""
- In Examples 3 and 4, ""bluf"" is followed by nothing or another word, and it is 'red' followed by the color represented by the following word.
- In Example 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""red red"" for ""bluf wif.""

From these observations, we see that “bluf” always results in the output “red,” and it seems to repeat the color of the word that comes right after “bluf.” Therefore, the rule can be summarized as follows:

- ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green green"", so ""walm"" after ""dax"" means repeating ""green"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" after ""zup"" means repeating ""yellow"" three times.
- ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" after ""lug"" means repeating ""blue"" three times.
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" does not seem to have a corresponding color, hence ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" three times after a red.",1.0,155,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples, especially focusing on words preceding ""walm"" and the corresponding colors in the output.

Here are the examples provided:

1. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
2. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

From these examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule by examining the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

- Every instance of ""walm"" seems to be associated with a sequence of three colors.
- The color before the first sequence of ""walm"" seems to be determined by the word immediately preceding it. For instance:
  - ""dax"" is followed by ""green""
  - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
  - ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""
- The word ""wif"" seems to trigger a change in color:
  - In the first and fifth examples, ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" and the color sequence changes from green to red. This implies ""wif"" might indicate a change, transition, or a negation of the previous color.

Given these observations, we might conclude:
- The word ""walm"" indicates a sequence of three colored items.
- The specific color associated with ""walm"" is determined by the word directly preceding it.
- In the presence of ""wif,"" the expected color pattern changes, suggesting a negation or alteration effect caused by ""wif.""

Rule: ""walm"" after a word X means three instances of the color associated with X, except when preceded by ""wif,"" which negates or changes the previously established color pattern. 

However, it is important to note that the dataset is limited and the rule might not hold universally. There could be exceptions or additional layers to the rule that are not evident without more examples.",0.8,155,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" dictates the number and color of the outputs. Here's the breakdown of the rules according to each input and its corresponding output:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" -> green green green red red red
2. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> yellow red green green green
3. ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
4. ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
5. ""dax wif walm"" -> green red red red

The color is associated with the word preceding ""walm"": 
- ""dax"" associates with green.
- ""zup"" associates with yellow.
- ""lug"" associates with blue.

Furthermore, every instance of ""walm"" seems to create a repetition of the associated color three times. However, when ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" there is a sequence of red after the initial color repetition. The presence of ""wif"" in between ""dax"" and ""walm"" also produces reds in the output, although it's not clear how many reds are produced based on the number of ""wif""s.

Thus, the rule could be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be outputted three times. When combined with ""wif,"" ""walm"" causes reds in the output.

For example, ""dax wif walm"" (green red red red) suggests one ""wif"" leads to three reds after the green, while ""dax walm wif walm"" (green green green red red red) suggests that one ""wif"" after ""walm"" leads to the same three reds following the green repetitions without additional greens. It's not entirely clear whether this is a rule or coincidence given the limited data set, but it's a plausible interpretation based on the available examples. 

Therefore:
walm -> causes the preceding color word to be outputted three times, and when followed by ""wif,"" results in a sequence of reds.",0.8,155,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,156,lug
"lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, lug consistently corresponds to the color blue. Therefore, the meaning can be defined as:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,156,lug
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word 'dax' occurs in the input, the word 'green' is present in the output at the corresponding position. There is no example where 'dax' does not translate to 'green', thus the meaning of 'dax' is deduced to be 'green.'",1.0,156,dax
"The nonce word ""dax"" in the context of these examples appears to consistently correspond to the output ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" is included in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. Moreover, other words correspond to different colors: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

From the above analysis, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: dax -> green

This indicates that in the context of these examples, ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,156,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. Each time ""dax"" is an input, ""green"" is the corresponding output component. There are no examples given that contradict this interpretation, and no additional context or rules within the examples that suggest a different meaning for ""dax"". Thus, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,156,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color. The color ""green"" appears in the output every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,156,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that individual non-English words are consistently translated into specific colors in English. Here's the breakdown of the translations I can deduce:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow (since ""zup"" also translates to yellow and ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which we determined to mean green)

Using this information, I conclude:

Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of ""dax"" in the examples corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,156,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The outputs are sequences of colors and each input seems to contribute to one color in the output. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output sequence.

Based on the examples:

- ""dax walm wif zup"" maps to ""green green red yellow"".
- ""lug dax wif"" maps to ""blue green red"".
- ""dax lug wif bluf"" maps to ""green blue red red"".
- ""wif dax"" maps to ""red green"".
- ""wif zup"" maps to ""red yellow"".

Given that ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input, we can deduce the following:

wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,156,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore:

wif -> red.",1.0,156,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in every example provided.",1.0,156,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""wif"" appears before a color in all instances and the color ""red"" is always present in the output when ""wif"" is in the input.

Here are the color associations for the other words:

- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red

The presence of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color associated with the word that follows it. Instead, ""wif"" itself is consistently translated to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
wif -> red",1.0,156,wif
"Based on the data provided, we can draw correlations between the instances of the word ""wif"" and the output colors that follow them. Here's what we can deduce from each input-output pair:

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- The word ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red
- Once again, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red
- In this example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", and ""bluf"" follows that, producing another ""red"".

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
- Here ""wif"" is the first word and followed by ""dax"", which produces a ""green"". The output for ""wif"" itself is ""red"".

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- ""wif"" is followed by ""yellow"" when the next word is ""zup"", but as in all cases, the first color after ""wif"" is ""red"".

Given these observations, the common factor following ""wif"" is the color ""red"". It seems that ""wif"" corresponds to an output of ""red"", regardless of what follows it. Thus, we can define the rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,156,wif
"To decipher the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine its placement and the resulting output colors in each example:

1. dax zup -> green yellow
2. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Analyzing the examples, it seems that ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems to be consistent and not dependent on context.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,156,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" let's examine its occurrences and the corresponding outputs in each example.

1. Example: ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
   Here, zup follows dax, which corresponds to ""green yellow"". Since ""dax"" by itself in other contexts produces the output ""green,"" we can tentatively assume that ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow.""

2. Example: ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""
   ""Walm"" appears in other examples and corresponds to ""red."" However, in the context of this example, it is ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup."" This suggests that ""zup"" might be influencing the color associated with ""walm.""

3. Example: ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   Here, ""bluf"" does not appear in any other context, but if we are maintaining the assumption that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" would correspond to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup."" 

4. Example: ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
   In this example, ""walm"" reverts to the output ""red"" suggesting that ""zup"" did not influence the color change in example 2 as it seemed initially. However, ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" does not have enough context to deduce its color independently.

5. Example: ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
   In this example, ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" does so too when following ""lug."" The appearance of ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" output, continuing to support the idea that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to an output of ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,156,zup
"Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow

According to the examples provided, every time the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,156,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the pattern in each example. Each word corresponds to a specific color. Here are the words with their corresponding colors extracted from the examples:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow (consistent in all examples)
- ""walm"" -> red, but in ""lug walm zup lug walm"" there are instances of blue which suggests ""lug"" might influence the color of ""walm"".
- ""bluf"" -> no direct color assignment, but if ""zup"" is yellow and ""dax"" is green, it's possible ""bluf"" does not change the sequence.
- ""lug"" -> no direct color assignment, but considering ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in blue before ""zup"" and blue after ""zup,"" ""lug"" likely influences ""walm"" to produce blue. When ""walm"" is not preceded by ""lug,"" its color is red.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" appears straightforward:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, irrespective of its position in the sequence. 

Hence, the rule for ""zup"" can be stated as:

zup -> yellow",1.0,156,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for the word 'zup':

1. In the examples where 'zup' is followed by 'dax,' it translates to 'yellow green,' suggesting that 'zup' means 'yellow' and 'dax' means 'green' (e.g., ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow"").

2. When 'zup' comes before another word besides 'dax,' that other word's corresponding color appears multiple times, indicating that 'zup' might function as a 'repeat the next color' instruction (e.g., ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""; 'walm' is likely 'yellow').

3. However, in the last example ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" 'zup' doesn't repeat the preceding color, as we see ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" Since 'walm' is likely 'yellow' and repeats three times before 'lug' (which by elimination seems to mean 'blue'), 'zup' appears to indicate a single occurrence of 'yellow.' 

Combining the observations, it seems that 'zup' itself, irrespective of context, translates to 'yellow.' Other words' meanings are affecting the sequence and repetition of colors, but 'zup' consistently corresponds to 'yellow.'

Rule: zup -> yellow",0.9,156,zup
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.,1.0,156,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we need to determine the rule or meaning behind the nonce word ""bluf."" We will analyze each input and its corresponding output to discern patterns.

Example 1:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Rule Derived: ""bluf"" might mean ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

Example 2:
Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
Rule Derived:
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" seems to be ""green,"" consistent from Example 1 (where ""dax"" was not followed by ""bluf"").
- ""bluf"" after ""wif"" is ""red.""
- ""bluf"" after ""zup"" seems to result in ""yellow,"" and that rule can be extracted from the repetition of ""zup bluf.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Example 3:
Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow
Rule Derived: 
- ""dax"" is ""green.""
- ""bluf"" following ""dax"" is still ""green.""
- ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow.""

Example 4:
Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Rule Derived: 
- ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in a repeated ""green,"" hinting ""walm"" might not change the color.

Example 5:
Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
Rule Derived: 
- ""dax"" followed by ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- ""wif"" is ""red.""
- ""zup"" and ""lug"" are ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. 

Inductive Generalization:
""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the preceding word. Specifically:
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it means ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it means ""green.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" follows any other word (like in Example 2, where it follows ""wif"" and in Example 5, where it did not follow ""wif"", ""dax"", or ""zup""), it does not have enough examples to determine a reliable rule.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning:
- ""bluf"" means ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
- ""bluf"" means ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""
- ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
- Additional context is needed to define what ""bluf"" means following other words.",1.0,156,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> ""red"" 

Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.",1.0,156,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"". Following each instance of ""bluf"", the word ""red"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red.",1.0,156,bluf
"Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green."" Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> green.",0.0,156,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the output patterns that correspond with its appearance:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" yields repeated reds (same number of reds as the position of ""walm"" in the input, counting from one):
   - Example: ""dax walm"" -> green green green
   - Example: ""wif dax walm zup"" -> (ignored) green red red red (ignored)

2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red repeated as before:
   - Example: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red (ignored) (ignored)

3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it changes the output to blue just in the case of ""lug"":
   - Example: ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
   - Example: ""dax lug wif walm"" -> (ignored) blue red red red

4. When ""walm"" appears without ""dax"" or ""wif"" immediately before it, the outputs for ""walm"" and each word preceding it, up to the previous instance of ""dax"", ""wif"", or the start of the sentence, are blue:
   - Example: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> yellow blue blue blue (ignored) (ignored)
   - Example: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> yellow (ignored) (ignored) green green
     - Note: The previous rule seems to override this one when ""walm"" follows ""dax"".

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to influence the output color based on its position and the preceding word. The rule appears to be: ""The output for 'walm' is red repeated according to its position in the sequence after 'dax' or 'wif'. When following 'lug', 'walm' changes previous outputs to blue up to but not including the last 'dax' or 'wif'. When 'lug' immediately precedes 'walm', the output for both is blue.""

Rule: walm -> modifies the output colors based on its position and neighboring words according to the specified patterns.",0.9,156,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the inputs and outputs, looking for patterns that correlate with the presence of ""walm.""

Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
Input: zup wif dax walm lug | Output: yellow red green green green blue
Input: dax lug wif walm | Output: green blue red red red
Input: zup lug walm wif dax | Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Given this data, every occurrence of ""walm"" leads to a string of ""red"" in the output, except when ""dax"" follows ""walm"", which then turns the next color to green (as seen in examples 1, 3, and 5). In example 2, where ""walm"" is followed by no word, it leads to a continuation of the preceding color, which is ""green"". Similarly, when ""lug"" follows ""walm"" in example 4, it leads to a string of ""red"". So, we can observe that ""walm"" seems to duplicate the previous color or change the following color based on specific next words.

Here's a tentative rule for ""walm"":
- When ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" the output color is ""green.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by any other word (or no word at all, as in example 2), the output color is ""red,"" and it repeats the same color for the number of words that follow until different rule affects the change (as seen with ""lug"" after ""walm"").

Therefore, based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be:
walm -> Duplicate the previous color's output unless followed by ""dax,"" then output ""green"". If followed by a word that has its own color rule, return to that rule after applying ""red"" once.",0.8,156,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each input and corresponding output sequence to identify recurring patterns associated with ""walm.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""walm"" must correspond to red, since it is between ""wif"" and ""dax"" which are both red and green respectively.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- In this example, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" must also be associated with green given the output.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
- Based on previous patterns, ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" to green. Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" corresponds to green since that is the output between ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue).

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- ""Dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red. Given that the output associated with ""walm"" here is red, this suggests that ""walm"" is taking on the characteristic of ""wif"" which precedes it.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- In this final example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green. Since the output for ""walm"" is blue, as is ""lug"" immediately before it, it seems that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> takes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence

Rule: If X is the color assigned to the word that precedes ""walm"" in the sequence, then the color assigned to ""walm"" is also X.",0.8,156,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we must look at the position and presence of ""walm"" in each input and the corresponding color sequence in the outputs. Let's analyze:

- In the first example, when ""wif walm dax zup"" is input, the ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of red colors ""red red red"".
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"".
- In the third example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" results in ""yellow red green green green blue"", with ""walm"" corresponding to ""green green green"" again.
- In the fourth input ""dax lug wif walm"", we see ""green blue red red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" leads to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"", with ""walm"" being ""blue blue blue"".

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" affects the following word (or words, if there are more than one ""walm"" in sequence), making each of them repeat the color that would normally be assigned to the lone word three times. For example, if ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", when they are preceded by ""walm"", they become ""green green green"" and ""red red red"" respectively.

Rule: walm -> When a word follows ""walm"", the color associated with that word is repeated three times. If multiple instances of ""walm"" are in sequence, the repetition of the color sequence applies to the word immediately following the last ""walm"".",0.8,156,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that all preceding words should be repeated with their assigned colors until ""walm"" is reached.

Explanation:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" output as ""red red red green yellow"" shows that ""wif"" must be red because it is repeated three times before reaching ""walm"".
2. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"", meaning ""dax"" must be green and is repeated three times.
3. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red green green green blue"", indicating that the words ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" are each colored once, and once ""walm"" is reached, ""dax"" is repeated two more times with its color green.
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" outputs ""green blue red red red"", suggesting that ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red. The word ""wif"" is repeated two more times after ""walm"".
5. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". Here, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and once ""walm"" is reached, ""lug"" is repeated two more times.

"Reviewing the given examples, we can attempt to identify a pattern that correlates the nonce word ""dax"" to a particular context or meaning. By comparing the inputs and outputs, we are looking to see if ""dax"" consistently corresponds to a particular term or rule within the given outputs.

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf

Let's analyze the outputs where ""dax"" appears:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by another undiscovered term ""walm"" and outputs ""green"".
- ""Dax"" alone produces ""green"".
- ""Dax"" is followed in different examples by ""lug"", ""zup"", and ""wif"", each with its respective color output, but after ""dax"" itself, the color ""green"" follows.
- In neither case does the order or combination of words following ""dax"" change the output color from ""green"" after ""dax"".

Based on the details above, the term ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"". No context or further rules appear to affect this correspondence; thus, it seems ""dax"" singularly produces the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

- ""zup"" outputs ""yellow""; ""bluf"" produces another ""yellow"". ""wif"" again yields ""red"", and ""walm"" seems to have a pattern, repeating the color given before it two more times (thus three ""red"").

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- ""wif"" leads with ""red""; ""bluf"" follows with another ""red""; ""lug"" shifts to ""blue"", and ""zup"" closes with ""yellow"".

Input: zup wif dax
Output: yellow red green
- ""zup"" begins with ""yellow""; ""wif"" outputs ""red"" once again, and ""dax"" results in ""green"".

In every case, no matter the position, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Therefore, we can determine that:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red",1.0,157,wif
"Based on the examples provided, wif consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Thus, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,157,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Each usage of ""wif"" in different contexts does not seem to change this output. Therefore, the simplest rule that can be induced from these examples is that ""wif"" represents the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,157,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Thus, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".",1.0,157,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples.",1.0,157,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,157,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,157,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.",1.0,157,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,157,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following translations for each word:

- lug -> blue
- bluf -> green
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

In all instances where the word ""zup"" appears, it is translated as ""yellow."" The word ""zup"" is not conditional on placement within the series of words, nor is it affected by the words that come before or after it.

Rule:
zup -> yellow",1.0,157,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

In each example, the appearance of the word ""bluf"" causes the following word's color to be repeated. For instance:

- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green red green yellow yellow,"" so bluf causes the preceding ""zup"" (or ""yellow"") to be repeated.
- ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow,"" so here again, bluf causes the preceding ""zup"" (or ""yellow"") to be repeated.
- ""zup dax bluf"" outputs ""yellow green green,"" so bluf causes the preceding ""dax"" (or ""green"") to be repeated.
- ""zup wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow red red,"" which shows bluf causing the preceding ""wif"" (or ""red"") to be repeated.
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" outputs ""green blue blue red,"" which means that not only does bluf cause repetition, but it doesn't prevent the subsequent color (""red"") associated with ""wif"" from being included as well.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be written as follows:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated in the output.",1.0,157,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" may correspond to a rule that repeats the color of the word that directly precedes it. To verify, let's check each example:

1. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" is also ""yellow,"" so it repeats the color of ""zup.""

2. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
   Again, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and both have the color ""yellow.""

3. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
   Here, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and both output the color ""green.""

4. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
   ""Wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and both output the color ""red.""

5. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
   ""Lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and both output the color ""blue.""

With all examples supporting the hypothesis, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it.",1.0,157,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule for the word ""bluf"".

1. Notice that every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output ends with two colors which are the same as the color which precedes ""bluf"".

2. ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color indicated by the word that comes before it.

Now, let's verify with the given examples:

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow
- ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", and ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and corresponds to yellow. ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and corresponds to green. ""bluf"" results in ""green green"".

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and corresponds to red. ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
- ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" and corresponds to blue. ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue"".

Based on these examples, the rule can be summarized as follows:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" duplicates the color indicated by the word that comes immediately before it. Rule: ""bluf"" outputs a pair of colors that match the color referred to by the preceding word.",1.0,157,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the color related to the previously mentioned color term being repeated. 

For example, in ""dax wif dax zup bluf"", the colors associated with previously mentioned terms are green for ""dax"", and yellow for ""zup"". When ""bluf"" is encountered, it duplicates the last mentioned color, resulting in ""yellow yellow"".

Therefore: bluf -> the color of the previous color term is repeated.",1.0,157,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the association between the input and output sequences.

Looking at the first example:
Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Here, each ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" After ""bluf"" the pattern is ""yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" is resulting in two ""yellow"" in a row.

Examining the second example:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Again, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" we again see ""yellow yellow.""

In the third example:
Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" we see ""green,"" which does not fit the initial observation.

The fourth example similarly contradicts our initial observation:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" but after ""bluf,"" it's ""red"" instead of ""yellow.""

Looking at the final example:
Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" we have another ""blue"" before proceeding to ""wif"" which is ""red.""

The key pattern here is that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: When ""bluf"" appears in a list, the output color will repeat the output color that corresponds to the word just before ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" generates a repetition of the output color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word.",0.8,157,bluf
"To determine what ""walm"" means, we need to identify any patterns in the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
3. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow

We can notice the following:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output, but not at the same position.
- In examples 1 and 3, which are the same, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", and the output sequence ends with green. ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"", and all previous colors are red.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""wif"" (red), with the output being ""blue"" before ""walm"" and ""red"" after.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by ""zup"" (yellow), and again the output is ""blue"" before and ""yellow"" after.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue), and again the output before ""walm"" is red and after is blue.

From these observations, a rule seems to emerge: ""walm"" causes an out of sequence repetition of the color before it (in the input-output mapping) to follow it in the output, whereas its own position in the output results in a color that would naturally follow the word after it in the input-output mapping.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"", whereas its own position in the output corresponds to the color that would follow the word after ""walm"".",0.8,157,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and compare the inputs with their outputs. Look for patterns in how ""walm"" is used and how it relates to the colors mentioned in the outputs.

In all five given examples, the word ""walm"" appears once and is consistently followed by a specific color in the output:

1. Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red **red green**

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue **blue red** blue blue

3. Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red **red green**

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue **blue blue** yellow blue

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red **red red** blue yellow

In every instance, the color following ""walm"" does not appear to be directly associated with ""walm"" itself; instead, ""walm"" is affecting the color associated with the word that comes before it in the input sequence. The rule is not simply a direct translation, as the color associated with ""walm"" varies depending on the preceding word.

By cross-referencing each instance, we can infer the following:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the following color is red (Example 1 and 3).
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the following color is blue (Example 2 and 4).
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the following color is red (Example 5).

Unfortunately, there are no examples given where either ""zup"" or ""bluf"" precede ""walm."" Additionally, the sample data has ""walm"" always following another word, which indicates that the rule for ""walm"" depends on the preceding word. Based on this observation, ""walm"" may be a modifier that changes the color associated with the preceding word. However, without further examples or a more diverse dataset, we cannot clearly establish a complete rule for ""walm""—we can only interpret its effect based on its position relative to other words.

Given this information, the rule would appear to be:

Rule: ""walm"" is a modifier that changes the color output associated with the word that comes immediately before it to a specific color, with the specific associations outlined above. However, this rule is incomplete without more data to confirm.

Given the limited examples, I can only provide a partial rule:

Rule: walm -> Walm turns the color associated with the preceding word into a specific color, potentially based on some rule related to the preceding word. However, the rule cannot be fully determined without additional examples.",0.8,157,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine the inputs and corresponding outputs in each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   
3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   
5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

Looking at examples 1 and 3, which are identical, the output for ""walm"" is consistent, indicating ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red."" Thus, ""wif walm dax"" always results in ""red red red green,"" regardless of repetition, suggesting that ""walm"" translates specifically to ""red.""

In example 2, ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue red,"" maintaining the pattern that ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

Example 4, however, presents ""lug walm"" outputting ""blue blue,"" which initially seems inconsistent with the previous analysis. However, if we consider the position of ""walm"" surrounded by ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue""), we may deduce that ""walm"" changes its output based on surrounding words. Indeed, this isn't the case because we see in other examples that ""walm"" produces ""red"" regardless of its neighboring words.

Finally, in example 5, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red,"" reinforcing the earlier conclusion that ""walm"" means ""red.""

With this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be constant:

Rule: walm -> red",0.8,157,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we should look at the commonalities and differences in the inputs and outputs of the provided examples.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Analyzing the examples, here is what we can deduce:
- ""walm"" appears in different positions in the input sentences.
- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the word right after it in the output is always ""red"".
- Each of the other non-walm words corresponds to a unique color in the output, suggesting a one-to-one mapping between specific words and colors.
- The placement of ""walm"" does not affect the order of the other colors, suggesting that it does not have an impact on the pattern of color mapping for those words.
- The word after ""walm"" in the input does not always correspond to the same color in the output. Hence, ""walm"" itself does not seem to be associated with a color conversion.

Given these observations, it seems the rule connected with ""walm"" could be that the output word following ""walm"" in the input will always be ""red"", regardless of what the following word is.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The output word following ""walm"" in the input is always ""red"".",0.8,157,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the position and corresponding color outputs in each example.

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

From observations:

- In examples 1 and 3, which are identical, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and both result in the sequence ""red red red green."" Thus, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" paired with ""dax"" results in ""red red green."" The fourth ""red"" in the sequence is likely from ""wif,"" as the pattern appears before ""walm"" in both cases.

- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the colors are ""blue blue blue red."" Given that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" based on prior examples, we can infer that ""walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red.""

- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue yellow."" The pattern suggests that ""lug"" converts to ""blue"" independently from ""walm,"" as seen in other examples. Thus, ""walm"" could be influencing the output before it or is self-contained.

- In example 5, we have ""dax wif walm lug zup"" outputting ""green red red red blue yellow."" Given that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" the subsequent ""red"" can be attributed to ""walm,"" matching the hypothesis that ""walm"" results in ""red"" when paired with ""dax."" However, it deviates slightly because the sequence is followed by a ""lug"" which typically results in ""blue.""

Considering all examples, we can make the following observations:

- ""walm"" does not have a straightforward one-to-one correspondence with a specific color.
- ""walm"" appears to influence the color output immediately following it, possibly turning the output red when it is followed by specific words (e.g., ""dax"").
- The influence of ""walm"" might be context-dependent, as it doesn't always result in the same color.
  
Given these observations, a potential rule for ""walm"" is that it modifies the color output of the word that follows it, often resulting in red, but this modification may depend on the specific combination of words or context.

Based on the available data, a definitive meaning for ""walm"" cannot be established. More examples are needed to derive a consistent rule.

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" is context-dependent and does not translate to a consistent color, but it often affects the color output next to it, which can result in the color red.",0.6,157,walm

Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The color does not change based on position in the list:

- lug -> blue

Now, let's consider the appearances of the word ""wif"":

- In examples where ""wif"" is present, the corresponding output color is always red.
- Whenever ""wif"" is absent, the color red is not present in the output sequence.
- Lastly, ""wif"" appears in different positions within the input sequences, but ""red"" is consistently the output color regardless of position.

5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Examining these examples, we can identify that ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" correspond to the colors green, blue, yellow, red, and blue respectively when translated in the Output. However, ""wif"" seems special since it always translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.

We can see that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"" in every example it appears, without any clear dependence on the sequence or context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,159,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the position of ""wif"" and the corresponding output in each provided example:

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which corresponds to ""red red"" in the output. ""Wif"" is producing a duplicate color of the word that follows it.

Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green

In this example, ""wif"" produces ""red,"" but it is not followed by a word that corresponds to ""red"" since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" However, ""wif"" occurs between two ""zup"" words.

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

In this instance, ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and is followed by ""red"" in the output, with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red

Here, ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red.""

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" itself corresponds to ""red"" once again.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,159,wif
"Analyzing the input and output pairs:

1. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
2. zup wif zup dax -> yellow red yellow green
3. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
4. lug dax wif -> blue green red
5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we must look for patterns that relate the placement of ""wif"" in the input to the colors in the output.

In example 1, ""wif"" appears between ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" and the corresponding output is ""red red."" This might suggest that ""wif"" could mean ""red,"" but there is an extra ""red"" at the end. However, comparing it to other lines, ""bluf"" seems always to correlate with red, so ""wif"" might still be ""red."" 

Looking at example 2, ""wif"" appears between ""zup"" and is followed by ""dax,"" with the output being ""red yellow green."" We already suspected from example 1 that ""wif"" could mean ""red."" This example supports that idea since ""wif"" here is translated as ""red"" in the output.

In example 3, ""wif"" appears at the beginning followed by the sequence ""dax lug walm,"" which translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Since ""wif"" is the only term in the input not directly translated into the color sequence, ""wif"" seems to be ""red"" again.

In example 4, ""wif"" is at the end after ""lug dax,"" and the corresponding output ends with ""red"" again, reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

In example 5, ""wif"" appears after a sequence of other words and is followed by ""dax,"" with the corresponding output being ""yellow red green."" Based on our previous findings, it seems consistent that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" as it does in the previous examples.

Based on the analyzed patterns in all examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""",1.0,159,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we should compare the various examples given and observe the patterns for the output when ""wif"" is included in the input. Let's look at each instance where ""wif"" appears and its corresponding output in parallel:

Input 1: dax lug wif bluf
Output 1: green blue red red

Input 2: zup wif zup dax
Output 2: yellow red yellow green

Input 3: wif dax lug walm
Output 3: red green blue blue blue

Input 4: lug dax wif
Output 4: blue green red

Input 5: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output 5: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Observations:
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the word immediately following (if any) is translated to ""red"" in the output.
- Additionally, ""wif"" on its own is also transformed into ""red"" (as in Input 3).
- Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" indicates the color ""red"", with some relationship to the position in which it is used resulting in ""red"" being the output for both the instance of ""wif"" and the word immediately following it.

From these observations, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as:

Rule: When occurring in a sequence, the word ""wif"" and the word immediately following ""wif"" are both translated to ""red"" in the output. If ""wif"" appears at the end of a sequence or on its own, it is translated to ""red"" as well.

Therefore:

wif -> red",0.8,159,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples.

Example 1:
Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Observation: The word ""zup"" appears at both the beginning and the end of the input sequence, and in both cases, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" 

Example 2:
Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

Observation: ""zup"" is at the beginning, and the first color is ""yellow."" The other words do not have a ""yellow"" associated with them.

Example 3:
Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Observation: Again, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow."" 

Example 4:
Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green

Observation: In the middle of the sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Example 5:
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Observation: When ""zup"" starts the input sequence, the first color is ""yellow.""

By examining the consistent association of ""zup"" with the color ""yellow"" across all examples, regardless of its position in the sequence, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,159,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This is a consistent pattern irrespective of the position of ""zup"" within the sequence. Thus:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,159,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look at the color that is associated with it in each example. In all instances, whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

In each of the provided examples:

- Example 1: Both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow.""
- Example 2: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Example 3: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Example 4: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Example 5: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" no matter where it appears in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,159,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""yellow"". The position of ""zup"" in the sequence does not change its corresponding output, which remains consistent across all examples.

Hence, the rule appears to be:

zup -> meaning: ""yellow""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,159,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples suggest that whenever the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,159,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" implying that ""bluf"" is repeating the color for ""dax"" (green).
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" again indicating repetition of the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue).
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup"" (yellow).

Rule: 
bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,159,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator for the color word that precedes it. Here is how the pattern is deduced:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" duplicates the color word ""wif"" (red).
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which fits the pattern of ""bluf"" duplicating the color word that comes before it, ""lug"" (blue). The sequence excludes ""dax"" as it is followed by another color word, ""lug,"" instead of ""bluf.""
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" becomes ""green green red yellow,"" which again supports that ""bluf"" duplicates ""dax"" (green) and does not affect subsequent words that do not have ""bluf"" after them.
- ""lug bluf zup"" turns into ""blue blue yellow,"" providing more evidence of the duplication rule for ""lug"" (blue) by ""bluf.""
- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here ""bluf"" only duplicates the preceding ""zup"" (yellow) and does not affect the ""lug"" (blue) before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the preceding color word.",1.0,159,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it.,1.0,159,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". 

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and following ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"", indicating that ""bluf"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated.
- In the second example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and following ""bluf"", the output includes ""blue blue"", reaffirming that ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color word. This pattern is consistent with the remaining ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
- The third and fourth examples further support the rule, with ""bluf"" following ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue) and the output color being repeated respectively.
- The fifth example shows ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""bluf"", and the output is again a repetition of the color preceding ""bluf"".",1.0,159,bluf
"Observing the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" has the function of repeating the color word that comes immediately before it. Here is how it works based on the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of the preceding word, which is ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" becomes ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" and again ""bluf"" takes the same color as ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- The third example, ""dax bluf wif zup,"" translates to ""green green red yellow,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green"" expressed by ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf zup,"" turns into ""blue blue yellow,"" and ""bluf"" means the same as ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" it translates into ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" just as the preceding word ""zup.""

Therefore, based on these observations, the rule seems to be: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the meaning of the preceding color word.",1.0,159,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word until a different word (wif) alters the pattern. If no word follows to change the pattern, ""walm"" continues the repetition of the associated color indefinitely.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. If followed by ""wif,"" a red color is inserted into the sequence, altering the pattern. If followed by ""bluf,"" a red color is also added to the sequence, suggesting that there may be a class of words that, when following ""walm,"" introduce a red color to the sequence.",1.0,159,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word except for ""walm"" corresponds to a color. It appears that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red. ""Bluf"" seems to be another color that corresponds to red. When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the color associated with the previous word is repeated three times, and if ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" an extra red is added to the sequence. ""Walm"" does not have a direct color association but instead affects the pattern of colors displayed.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times, and if followed by ""wif,"" add one red after.",1.0,159,walm
"walm -> triple the previous color, then add red

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears, the output consists of the color corresponding to the preceding word repeated three times, followed by the color red. If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" ""wif"" is represented by the color red as well, resulting in two reds in sequence.",1.0,159,walm
"walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times. When ""wif"" follows ""walm"", a red is added after the repetitions. If ""walm"" is followed by another word (""bluf"" in the last example), a red is added after the repetitions, followed by the color associated with the following word.",1.0,159,walm
"Observing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, the following rule can be deduced:

When the nonce word ""walm"" is preceded by another word, that word in the output is repeated three times followed by the color ""green."" When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" the sequence ends with ""red."" Note that ""walm"" itself does not directly correspond to a specific color, but rather dictates the pattern of repetition and, when applicable, the inclusion of ""red.""

Here is the breakdown of the rule based on each input and output pair:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug | Output: blue blue blue red blue
Rule: ""lug"" -> blue
When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" thrice, and followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" then ""lug"" is translated once more to ""blue.""

2. Input: zup walm wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow red
Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow
Here ""walm"" is making ""zup"" repeat three times, followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red.""

3. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
Rule: ""dax"" -> green
When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in ""dax"" being translated to ""green"" three times, with no ""red"" at the end as ""wif"" is not present.

4. Input: dax zup walm wif | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Rule: ""dax"" -> green; ""zup"" -> yellow
In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so ""zup"" is repeated thrice, and ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the end. 

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf | Output: blue blue blue red red
Rule: ""lug"" -> blue; ""bluf"" -> red
""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in three ""blues,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which is also ""red.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,160,dax
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the following associative patterns:

- The position of ""wif"" doesn't seem to matter; it always corresponds to ""red"":

  - ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
- Multiple instances where ""wif"" is surrounded by other words still result in ""red"":
  - ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" (note that ""walm"" hasn't appeared elsewhere, so it's not clear which part of the output it corresponds to, but we can confirm it doesn't affect ""wif"")

- In the second example, ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" and then ""wif"" is once again translated to ""red."" The repetition of ""walm"" corresponds to repeating ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is directly translated to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" as well, or it could be that the addition of a new word repeats the previous color word.

Considering this information, we can induce the rule that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,160,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red"". It does not seem to change regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Thus, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

"Rule: wif -> red

"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. There is a consistent pattern where a given input word corresponds to the same output color across all examples. To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the outputs where it appears and look for the consistent color that follows it.

Looking at the patterns:

- ""zup"" in ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"", but since ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in other examples, ""zup"" must correspond to ""yellow"".
- ""lug dax zup wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow red"". Here, ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""wif"" with ""red"", which leaves ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- ""wif walm dax zup"" gives us ""red red red green yellow"". Since ""wif"" aligns with ""red"", ""walm"" also seems to align with ""red"" when its position in the sequence is considered, ""dax"" aligns with ""green"", leaving ""zup"" as ""yellow"".
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" to ""green"" based on their positions, reinforcing ""zup"" as ""yellow"".
- ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" apparently to ""yellow"" based on this sequence, confirming ""zup"" as ""yellow"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the given examples. In each example, the word ""bluf"" correlates with a specific color in the output. The colors before and after ""bluf"" in the output suggest that ""bluf"" itself could represent a color.

However, to accurately determine what ""bluf"" stands for, we need to observe the relationship between input and output with special attention to the colors before and after ""bluf."" Here are the observations:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" precedes a sequence of two ""lug"" which map to the color blue. ""bluf"" itself is also mapped to blue in this case. This suggests that ""bluf"" is related to the color blue.
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" follows the words ""zup dax"" and ""dax zup"" respectively, and both result in the output sequence ""yellow green green."" We notice the color following ""green"" has been repeated, indicating ""bluf"" might be taking the color of the previous word or creating a sequence.
- In the fourth example, it's the same as the third example, reinforcing the pattern observed – the output color doesn't depend on the order of the words before ""bluf.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""wif,"" which is mapped to ""red,"" while ""bluf"" itself gives ""blue"" again.

These points suggest that ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the color blue in the output, independent of its position in the input list or the surrounding words.

Rule: bluf -> blue. ""Bluf"" represents the color blue.",1.0,160,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples given:

3. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""

2. ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green.""
3. ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue.""
4. ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Based on the pattern observed, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeats the color of the previous word. 

This means that ""bluf"" takes on the color specified for the word immediately before it.",1.0,160,bluf
"Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" seems to translate to the color ""yellow"" whenever it follows the word ""zup,"" but it translates to the color ""blue"" in all other contexts. Therefore, the rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow""; in all other contexts, ""bluf"" means ""blue"".",1.0,160,bluf
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it comes after ""zup"" and to the color ""blue"" otherwise. Here are the observations supporting this:

1. In the first input, the sequence ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" and the following ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but when ""bluf"" appears without ""zup"" before it, it translates to ""blue.""

2. In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax"" and the output is green for ""dax"" and yellow for both ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" which matches the rule since ""bluf"" follows ""zup.""

3. The third and fourth inputs are the same, with ""dax zup bluf"" translating to ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" once again follows ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow.""

4. In the fifth input, ""zup lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue red."" In this case, ""bluf"" does not follow ""zup"" directly (it is preceded by ""lug"") hence ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

2. Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. In the examples where ""walm"" is not directly preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax,"" the output is ""red red red.""

Additionally, we see that ""wif"" and ""zup"" translate to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively in the output, and the positions of these words in the inputs and outputs correspond directly.

Given these patterns, it seems like ""walm"" being preceded by certain words changes its meaning. Let's construct a rule based on this information:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax,"" to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug,"" and to ""red"" in other cases (or when not directly preceded by these specific words).

So, the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the context as follows:

walm -> meaning:

- After ""lug"": ""blue""
- Otherwise or elsewhere: ""red""",1.0,160,walm
"The examples provided suggest that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color word that precedes it three times. To confirm this, we will examine each example:

- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" translates to green, and ""walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" ""wif"" translates to red, and ""walm"" corresponding to ""wif"" leads to ""red red red."" Next, ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""walm"" corresponding to the second occurrence of ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" translates to red, and ""walm"" leads to ""red red red.""
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" translates to red, and ""walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" even though ""bluf"" does not seem to correlate to a specific color in this instance.

From the examples, we can infer that ""walm"" is a function that repeats the color associated with the word just before it three times. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,160,walm
"From the given examples, we can induce the following pattern:

- When 'dax walm' is mentioned, the output is 'green green green'.
- When 'lug walm' is mentioned, the output is 'blue blue blue'.
- In a longer string containing 'wif walm', like 'wif walm zup lug zup walm', the segments of the output relative to 'wif walm' and 'walm' consistently translate to repetitions of 'red red red' and 'yellow yellow yellow', respectively.
- 'zup wif walm' leads to 'yellow red red red', indicating that 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', and again 'walm' is associated with a repeating of the color word (three times).
- Lastly, 'zup bluf wif walm' leads to 'yellow yellow red red red'. This reaffirms the rule that 'zup' means 'yellow' as it appears twice before 'bluf', which must therefore mean 'yellow' as well. Given that 'wif' also translates to 'red' and 'walm' follows with 'red red red', the pattern of 'walm' inducing a triplication of the color word is consistent.

Based on the consistent pattern across all examples, the rule for 'walm' seems to be causing the repetition of the color word that would otherwise represent the preceding word's color. Therefore, we can define the rule for 'walm' as follows:

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the preceding color word.",1.0,160,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color word that is referenced by the word preceding it. Here's the analysis for each example:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: ""dax"" means green, and ""walm"" repeats the color referenced by ""dax"".

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" means blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color referenced by ""lug"".

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" means red, ""lug"" means blue, ""zup"" means yellow, and ""walm"" follows the pattern by repeating the color of the word that precedes it.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: ""zup"" means yellow, ""wif"" means red, and ""walm"" repeats the color referenced by ""wif"".

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Rule: ""zup"" means yellow, ""bluf"" seems to have no change in color meaning and may not be defined (as evidenced by no change from the ""zup"" output of yellow), ""wif"" means red, and ""walm"" again repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. Therefore,

walm -> The meaning is that it repeats the color word that immediately precedes it. Rule: If a color word is followed by ""walm"", the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.",1.0,160,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the consistent patterns in the given examples:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Therefore:

"From the provided examples, we can try to infer a rule for the meaning of ""dax"". We observe that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is related to the color green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is again related to the color green.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" continues to correspond to green.

When ""dax"" is used in different positions within the input, it consistently maps to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule we can derive based on the given examples is:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,161,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding output to see if we can identify any patterns.

2. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
3. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
4. zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green
5. dax zup -> green yellow

From the examples provided, we can note the following:

- ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input.
- The other words in the input (e.g., ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug"") correspond to different colors in each of their appearances.

Based on the given information, the rule we can infer is that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of the context.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,161,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. There doesn't appear to be any context dependency for the meaning of ""dax."" Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,161,dax
"Based on the examples given, we can infer that ""dax"" is associated with the color green each time it appears. No other words consistently translate to green, and ""dax"" never corresponds to anything but green in the given examples. Therefore, the deduced meaning of ""dax"" is the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,161,dax
"Looking at each instance where the word ""dax"" appears:

1. dax wif dax -> green red green
   - Both instances of ""dax"" map to ""green.""

2. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" maps to ""green"" here as well.

3. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
   - ""dax"" is surrounded by ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" itself maps to ""green.""

4. zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green
   - In this case, ""dax"" is at the end and maps to ""green.""

5. dax zup -> green yellow
   - ""dax"" appears at the beginning and maps to ""green.""

In every example given, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green.""

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" as well, suggested by the second and third examples.
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" is in the sequence; its corresponding output is always ""yellow"". Assuming ""zup"" has a consistent meaning across all contexts provided by these examples, it appears that:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the given examples, when the input contains the word ""zup,"" the output consistently has the word ""yellow."" We can align each instance where ""zup"" is mentioned and check the resulting color in the output:

- Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue (Here, ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue."")
- Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow (Here, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" seem to correspond to ""red."")
- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red (Here, ""bluf"" might correspond to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""walm"" might be an additive term for an extra ""red."")

- Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow (Here, ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green."")

As ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of position or other words, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup.""

Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow
Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow

It appears that each input word is mapped to a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every output, regardless of its position in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the input and output examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red (note: ""bluf"" appears to map to ""red"" despite being phonetically similar to ""blue"")
- walm -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a pattern where each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" implying ""zup"" could mean ""yellow"" since ""lug"" is the only other word and it correlates with ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf zup"" leads to ""red red yellow."" We already suspected ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and here it appears to hold. The word ""wif"" may mean ""red"" because it precedes a ""red"" in the output, and since ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" ""bluf"" can't be ""yellow"" and is likely ""red"" as well, if we assume ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red."" We saw previously ""zup"" might be ""yellow,"" and now we confirm ""bluf"" could mean ""yellow"" since their positions switched and the color sequence did not, implementing a rule that says ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" if it's before ""wif."" ""Wif"" seems consistently to mean ""red,"" and ""walm"" apparently also translates to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug"" means ""red yellow yellow blue."" This solidifies ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" following the trend. ""Wif"" means ""red,"" ""bluf"" following ""zup"" still yields ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. The precise color it corresponds to is not consistent across all examples, but ""bluf"" appears to be a color word used in the output. However, each use of ""bluf"" is paired with the appearance of ""red"" in the output.

From the inputs and outputs, we can deduce:

- When ""lug bluf"" appears, ""blue red"" is the output.
- When ""wif bluf"" appears, ""red red"" is the output.
- When ""zup bluf"" appears, ""yellow yellow green blue"" is the output, indicating a less direct relationship, but still paired with ""blue"" eventually.

It seems that ""bluf"" can be followed by red or blue depending on the preceding word. However, the pattern is inconsistent in the last example, suggesting there may be more complexity to the rules that aren't captured by the exact word ""bluf"" alone.

1. ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and the output color is ""blue"" repeated three times.
2. ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and the output color is ""green"" repeated three times.

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red green."" 
2. In the second example, ""wif"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""zup,"" producing ""red yellow,"" and at the end, followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red green.""

From these observations, we can establish a rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> ""red"".

No matter the position or sequence within the input, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,162,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"", we can look at the patterns of colors associated with the words in the input and their corresponding positions in the output. Since ""wif"" is the only common word in all examples provided, one can conclude it applies a consistent rule to the output based on its usage.

Looking at the examples:
1. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red"": ""wif"" is at the end, resulting in ""red.""
2. ""wif zup wif dax"" -> ""red yellow red green"": ""wif"" appears at the beginning and in the middle, resulting in ""red"" at the beginning and middle.
3. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green"": Here ""wif"" also appears at the beginning and in the middle positions, both leading to ""red.""
4. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"": ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""walm"" is associated with two instances of ""red.""
5. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow"": Once again, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" but here, the other words do not align with the previous examples.

From the consistency of the color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" in all positions (beginning, middle, and end), we can induce that the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,162,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red."" Additionally, ""dax"" seems to correlate with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" seems to follow a pattern where it can be either ""green"" or ""yellow"" depending on its position relative to ""wif"" or ""dax."" Similarly, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" except when it follows ""wif,"" in which case the output is ""red."" ""Walm"" also correlates with ""red,"" as seen in the fourth example.

The rule thus seems to be:

wif -> red.",1.0,162,wif
"Observing the examples provided and the resulting outputs, we can attempt to deduce the rule that defines the meaning of ""wif."" 

Looking at instances where ""wif"" is used, we can determine the following:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color is always red followed by green (e.g., ""wif dax"" results in ""red green"").
2. When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is red followed by yellow (e.g., ""wif zup wif"" results in ""red yellow red"").
3. When ""wif"" is on its own, the output is a repetition of the color red (e.g., ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"").
4. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output color can either be red followed by red (when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" directly as in ""wif bluf"") or red followed by yellow when ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" (""wif zup bluf"" results in ""red yellow yellow"").

Comparing ""Input: wif zup wif dax"" with its output ""Output: red yellow red green"" suggests that ""wif"" typically indicates the color red, as it consistently translates to red in the presence of another word thereafter.

From this, we can infer that ""wif"" likely means red. However, given that ""wif"" seems to influence the color assigned to the subsequent word, there appears to be a more complex interaction at play rather than a direct one-to-one correspondence.

To articulate this as a rule:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color red and influences the color assigned to the following word in a consistent pattern (e.g., ""dax"" after ""wif"" is green, while ""zup"" after ""wif"" is yellow).

Therefore, the deduction based on the given examples is:

wif -> red",0.9,162,wif

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,162,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to be a modifier that changes the color associated with the word that follows it. To determine the rule for what ""bluf"" means, we can compare the output colors from the examples given where ""bluf"" is used and the corresponding word that follows it.

Considering the examples:
- wif bluf -> red red
- dax bluf -> green green
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow

In each case, the word following ""bluf"" gets the same color as it would have had if it were not preceded by ""bluf."" However, ""bluf"" repeats the color, effectively duplicating it.

Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" repeats the color assigned to the following word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the following word.",1.0,162,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each input and its corresponding output:

4. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   
5. Input: zup bluf wif

Considering the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" results in repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here's the pattern:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.,1.0,162,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output to identify any patterns:

1. `wif bluf zup bluf wif` corresponds to `red red yellow yellow red`.

2. `wif bluf dax walm` corresponds to `red red green green green`.

3. `dax bluf wif zup dax` corresponds to `green green red yellow green`.

4. `zup bluf lug` corresponds to `yellow yellow blue`.

5. `zup bluf wif` corresponds to `yellow yellow red`.

Looking at these examples, it seems that when the word ""bluf"" appears, the color outputted immediately after it matches the color of the word immediately preceding it:

1. ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"".
2. ""wif"" (red) again, followed by ""bluf"" and output is ""red red"".
3. ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green"".
4. ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"".
5. ""zup"" (yellow) again, followed by ""bluf"" and output is ""yellow yellow"".

The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color to be the same as the color of the preceding word.",1.0,162,bluf
"Based on the sequences provided in the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that comes before it in a predetermined color sequence—specifically, the color that immediately precedes the mentioned color in the pattern of a traffic light (i.e., red -> yellow -> green -> blue). 

To elaborate using the examples given:

1. In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"":
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" after ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (since ""red"" comes before ""yellow"" in our traffic light sequence)
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" after ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (since ""yellow"" comes before ""green"")

2. In ""wif bluf dax walm"":
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" after ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- Since ""walm"" is not matched to any color in the output, we will consider it a continuation of the color sequence that ""dax"" (green) started, thus two ""green"" in the output.

3. In ""dax bluf wif zup dax"":
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" after ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- The last ""dax"" keeps its correspondence to ""green""

4. In ""zup bluf lug"":
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" after ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" is not explicitly translated in the examples, but given that it leads to ""blue"" in the output, it may suggest that there's no known color to come before ""blue"" in our sequence.

5. In ""zup bluf wif"":
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" after ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Thus, the meaning of bluf seems to translate to: ""repeat the color that directly precedes the color associated with the word that comes right before bluf in a sequence mirroring the order of colors in traffic lights, omitting blue which is only mentioned if there's an unknown color presented like in 'lug'"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that directly precedes the known color before it in the traffic light sequence (red -> yellow -> green), omitting the mention of blue unless following an unknown color indicator.",0.8,162,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us look at each input and its corresponding output and try to identify patterns.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" might be triple of the color that precedes it.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"" again, followed by ""walm"" which translates into ""red red red,"" supporting our initial observation that ""walm"" might repeat the color that precedes it three times. ""lug"" is followed by a single ""blue"" again, and ""bluf"" seems to introduce another ""blue,"" though this was not in the first input to observe patterns for ""bluf.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" producing ""green green green,"" following our established pattern of ""walm"" repeating the preceding color three times.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Here ""wif"" produces ""red,"" ""dax"" yields ""green,"" and ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" again tripling the preceding color to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the preceding ""green"" three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Meaning: ""Walm"" causes a triplet repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.",1.0,162,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and its output is three blues, but ""lug"" itself corresponds to just one blue.
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and the output is three reds; in this scenario ""walm"" follows a pattern of repeating the color of the word before it three times.
- The third example confirms this as it follows ""dax"" and the output is three greens.
- The fourth example shows ""walm"" following ""zup"" with the output being three yellows.
- The fifth example is consistent with the fourth, with three greens following the single mention of ""green"" associated with ""dax.""

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to be the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,162,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the previous color word output, with the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of nonce words said before ""walm"".

Let's analyze each example:

1. ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". After ""walm"", the word ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" outputs ""red red red blue blue"". We notice that after ""walm"", ""red"" (the first color) is repeated twice more before moving on to the next color words.

3. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"", the word ""green"" is repeated twice more.

4. ""wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""red green yellow yellow yellow"". In this sequence, after ""walm"", ""yellow"" (the last color mentioned before ""walm"") is repeated three times.

5. ""zup dax walm"" outputs ""yellow green green green"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". After ""walm"", the word ""green"" is repeated three times, following the two non-color words before ""walm"".

So, the rule for the word ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated a number of times equal to the number of nonce words preceding ""walm"" in the input.",1.0,162,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs, noting how the word ""walm"" modifies the outputs:

- In the first example, when ""walm"" is combined with ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated four times.
- In the second example, without ""lug,"" the output is three reds followed by two blues, suggesting that ""walm"" might cause a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
- In the third example, it's only ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three greens, reinforcing the idea of repetition.
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup walm"" yields ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the last color stated before it, which is yellow.
- The last example, ""zup dax walm,"" presents a pattern of one yellow followed by three greens. 

Based on these observations, we can come up with a rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""Walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. The number of repetitions is equal to the total count of words present before ""walm,"" including the word right before ""walm.""

So the rule is:
walm -> Causes the repetition of the last mentioned color, with the number of repetitions equal to the total count of words before ""walm.""",0.9,162,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns associated with the input and output provided in each example. Let's analyze each example and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

From these given data points, we notice:

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, the word ""wif"" precedes sequences with the initial color as red, ""dax"" with green, and ""zup"" with yellow.
- The word ""lug"" is always associated with the color blue (examples 1 and 2).
- Whenever the word ""walm"" is present, a sequence of colors repeats, and the sequence length corresponds to the number of nonce words following ""walm"" plus one.

Analyzing these patterns, ""walm"" seems to act as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the previous nonce word a number of times. This number is equal to the total number of nonce words that follow ""walm,"" plus one for the original occurrence:

- In example 1, ""lug"" is associated with blue. After ""walm,"" there are no other words, so blue is repeated once (the output is blue blue blue, but remember there was originally another blue from ""lug"" for a total of four).
- In example 2, ""walm"" comes before ""lug,"" and there is one word (lug) following ""walm."" Thus, the color associated with ""wif"" (red) is repeated three times, followed by the color for ""lug"" (blue), twice, because ""bluf"" does not seem to change the color associated with ""lug.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with green. No words follow ""walm,"" hence green is repeated three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow. As two words (""dax"" and ""zup"") precede walm, the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated three times.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is associated with green and comes right before ""walm"" which is at the end, resulting in green being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> the preceding color is repeated a number of times equal to the count of nonce words following ""walm"" plus one.",0.8,162,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,163,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color green in the output. Every time ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is present in the exact same position in the output. This suggests that the rule is consistent irrespective of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,163,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the examples given. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red

3. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green

5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

Now let's break down the patterns:
- Whenever ""dax"" appears as the first word, ""green"" is the first color in the output.
- When ""dax"" is the second word, ""green"" is the second color in the output.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input correlates with the position of ""green"" in the output.

It seems that ""dax"" does not correspond to a fixed color independent of position but indicates that the color ""green"" should appear in the output at the same position where ""dax"" appears in the input.

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" and its position in the input sequence dictates the position of ""green"" in the output sequence.",1.0,163,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
Input: lug dax bluf -> Output: blue green green
Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue

""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. The color that follows ""green"" in the output seems to be determined by the word that follows ""dax"" in the input.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,163,dax
"Based on the given examples, where ""dax"" is always followed by another word and the output is always ""green"" followed by another color, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the output ""green.""

Hence, we can deduce the following rule: 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,163,dax
"dax -> meaning. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to correlate to the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence.

"Rule: wif -> red

"Based on the provided examples where the input is matched to a certain output color, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs.

1. In every example where ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"":

   - Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm / Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   (The first ""red"" corresponds to the first ""wif"")

   - Input: lug wif lug / Output: blue red blue
   (The ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"")

   - Input: wif / Output: red
   (The only word ""wif"" corresponds to the only color ""red"")

   - Input: wif zup bluf wif dax / Output: red yellow yellow red green
   (The first and fourth ""red"" correspond to the two instances of ""wif"")

   - Input: wif zup / Output: red yellow

From this pattern, it seems clear that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,163,wif
"Based on the given examples, here's the induction of the rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

In each case, when the input contains the word ""wif,"" the corresponding output is ""red."" There are no instances where ""wif"" leads to a different output, regardless of the words that come before or after it. Therefore, the rule seems to be consistent and does not depend on context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,163,wif

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,163,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs.",1.0,163,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each utterance in the input corresponds with a specific color in the output. Given the consistent appearance of ""zup"" with the color ""yellow,"" we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates specifically to the color ""yellow.""  

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,163,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the corresponding output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,163,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be consistent across all examples. Whenever ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,163,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look for patterns concerning its placement and corresponding output colors:

In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is produced. This is consistent throughout all examples, regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input. Here's a breakdown:

- When ""zup"" is present by itself, the output is ""yellow"" (Example 2).
- When ""zup"" is present at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a series, the output color for ""zup"" is still ""yellow"" (Examples 1, 3, 4, and 5).

Thus, based on the observations from the examples, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and this does not change with context or position.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,163,zup
"The given examples suggest that ""zup"" yields a specific color as output when it appears in the input. The color output that corresponds to ""zup"" is consistent across all examples, which is yellow.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,163,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we observe that the output sequence changes color depending on the presence and position of certain words in the input sequence. Here's what we can gather from each example:

1. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" repeated the color linked to ""dax.""
2. ""wif bluf dax"" yields ""red red green,"" where ""bluf"" repeated the color of ""wif"" before the color for ""dax"" is shown.
3. ""dax zup bluf"" turns into ""green yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" repeating the color of ""zup.""
4. ""lug wif bluf"" becomes ""blue red red,"" with ""bluf"" repeating the color of ""wif.""
5. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" duplicating the color sequence of ""dax zup.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" repeats the color or colors of the words immediately preceding it. More formally:

Rule: bluf repeats the sequence of colors corresponding to the words right before it.",1.0,163,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the colors of the previously mentioned words. Rule: Each word preceding bluf is associated with a specific color (dax = green, wif = red, zup = yellow, lug = blue), and the word bluf causes the output to repeat the sequence of colors that correspond to the words before it.",1.0,163,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's identify patterns by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
- The word ""bluf"" here has resulted in a repetition of the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
- The appearance of ""bluf"" after ""wif"" resulted in repeating the color for ""wif"" before moving on to the color for ""dax.""

Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
- Once again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"" is repeated.

Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
- ""Bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and repeats the ""red"" color associated with ""wif.""

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output: green red green yellow yellow
- ""Bluf"" appears at the end and the pattern of repeating the color before it (""yellow"" associated with ""zup"") follows.

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" seems to cause the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,163,bluf
"Bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples, bluf causes the output to repeat the colors associated with the words immediately preceding it. The rule seems to be that for every word prior to ""bluf,"" the color it corresponds to is repeated in the output once ""bluf"" is encountered.

Rule:
- dax corresponds to the color green.
- wif corresponds to the color red.
- zup corresponds to the color yellow.
- lug corresponds to the color blue.

When ""bluf"" follows these words, the output repeats their respective color(s) in the order they appeared before ""bluf.""",1.0,163,bluf
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at its context and the corresponding outputs:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow

Looking at the examples, we can see that the word following ""bluf"" (if there is one) appears to determine the second color in the output:

- No word after ""bluf""; the second color repeats the first (example 1).
- ""dax"" after ""bluf"" results in ""green"" as the second color (examples 2 and 5).
- Where ""bluf"" is last, all the colors repeat, except where ""zup"" is present, which introduces a ""yellow"" color (examples 3 and 5).

Additionally, the word ""bluf"" itself does not seem to have a consistent output in color, but rather, it copies the color of the word before it, if there's a word before it, otherwise, it repeats the color it produces (as seen in example 1).

Thus, the rule appears to be:

- ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, or if it is the first word, the color it produces is repeated as the second color.
- If a word follows ""bluf,"" the corresponding output color of that word becomes the second color in the output sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeats the color code of the immediately preceding word or repeats its own color code if no word precedes it; the word following ""bluf"" determines the second color code when present.",0.8,163,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word thrice.

Based on the given input and output pairs, ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" three times.

- In the first and third examples, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" after ""dax"" (which corresponds to the color green), results in the color ""green"" being repeated three times.
- Similarly, in the fourth example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which means that ""walm"" after ""wif"" (which corresponds to the color red), results in the color ""red"" being repeated three times.
- In the second example, we see the sequence ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" meaning that ""walm"" after ""lug"" (corresponding to blue) causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Here is the rationale for each instance:

1. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green
   ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"" and is followed by ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" thus ""zup"" equates to ""yellow.""

2. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" (""green"") and is followed by ""walm,"" and since the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" we can deduce that ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

3. lug zup dax zup -> blue yellow green yellow
   Here ""zup"" is surrounded by known translations ""lug"" -> ""blue"" and ""dax"" -> ""green,"" and in both places where ""zup"" appears, it translates to ""yellow.""

4. lug zup -> blue yellow
   Similarly, ""zup"" follows ""lug"" (""blue"") and the output is ""yellow.""

5. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
   ""zup"" appears at the beginning followed by ""dax"" (""green""), and the first color in the output is ""yellow,"" reinforcing the deduction that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,164,zup
"Based on the examples given:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow""
- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red""
- ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""

We could deduce that the word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the preceding color word.",1.0,164,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat or double the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the analysis of each example:

1. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
   ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats the color.

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color red, ""lug"" might correspond to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

3. Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
   ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color red.

4. Input: wif bluf zup | Output: red red yellow
   ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color red, and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax bluf | Output: green green

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word that comes before it.",1.0,164,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to whatever color is associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the interpretation based on each example:

1. In ""zup bluf"", the word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, so ""bluf"" translates to yellow.
2. In ""wif bluf lug zup"", the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red, so ""bluf"" translates to red.
3. In ""zup wif bluf"", the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red, so ""bluf"" translates to red.
4. In ""wif bluf zup"", the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red, so ""bluf"" translates to red.
5. In ""dax bluf"", the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green, so ""bluf"" translates to green.

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,164,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes before bluf.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is the color corresponding to the preceding word, repeated twice.",1.0,164,bluf
Rule: bluf repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.,1.0,164,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we need to figure out what the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to in terms of the output colors. Let's analyze each example one by one:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red""
2. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow""
3. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""

Looking at these examples:

- In the 1st and 4th example, each occurrence of ""walm"" results in three of the same color (red and green, respectively), suggesting ""walm"" means to repeat the last color mentioned.
  
- The 2nd example reinforces this idea because ""walm"" after ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) leads to three greens.

- The 3rd example shows ""lug wif dax zup,"" followed by ""walm,"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" corresponds with yellow, and following ""walm,"" we see three yellows.

- The 5th example again shows the last mentioned color, yellow after ""zup,"" is repeated three times after the word ""walm"" is used.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the last mentioned color three times.",1.0,164,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the outputs associated with its occurrence in the given examples:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" -> Output: green green green red red red
2. ""dax walm zup"" -> Output: green green green yellow
3. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

When we see the outputs, we can identify the following patterns:

- The word ""walm"" is linked with a repetition of the color that directly precedes it.
- The repetition is three times for that color.
- This pattern holds true for every instance ""walm"" is used, where the color before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output sequence.

For example, in the first input ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""wif"" is associated with red. Where ""walm"" appears, it causes ""green"" to repeat thrice, and when ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" it causes ""red"" to repeat thrice.

Another example is the last input, ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" where ""zup"" is associated with yellow and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated thrice in the output.

Based on the consistent application of this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the following color to be repeated three times in the output sequence.",0.9,164,walm
"To deduce what the nonce word ""walm"" means from the given examples, let's examine the patterns that arise when ""walm"" appears in the input and how it corresponds to the color in the output. Here's what we can observe:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the colors green and red alternate, starting with green: ""green green green red red red""

- Without ""dax"" before it but with ""zup"" anywhere in the input, ""walm"" leads to a sequence of yellows: ""yellow yellow yellow""

- In other contexts, it generates a sequence of the last color before transitioning to a new one. This pattern is noticeable when ""walm"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif"" and dictates the repetition of the last color mentioned.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be predicated on the word occurring before it. If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" it starts with three instances of green followed by three reds. Otherwise, ""walm"" causes three repetitions of the last color stated before it. Summarized rule:

Rule: walm -> Causes repetition of the previous color or a specific sequence of colors based on the preceding word:
- When preceded by ""dax,"" output green thrice, then red thrice.
- Otherwise, produce three repetitions of the last color mentioned before ""walm.""",0.9,164,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the output color sequence based on certain conditional placements or interaction with other nonce words such as ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup."" Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

1. In every instance, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that immediately follows ""walm"" in the input sequence, with the repetition occurring three times.
   
   For example: 
   - ""dax walm wif"" leads to ""green green green,"" where ""green"" follows ""walm"" and is repeated three times.
   - ""lug wif dax zup walm"" leads to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""yellow"" follows ""walm"" and is repeated three times.

2. The repetition of the color does not depend on the position of ""walm"" in the sentence as long as there is a color word following it in the input. Even when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the following color (which would be said next) is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word in the sequence to repeat three times. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input, it's assumed that the color to repeat is the one that would follow next in the sequence.",0.8,164,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns of input and output:

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

From this example, we see that the occurrence of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that precedes it three times, hence ""green"" is repeated thrice and then ""red"" is repeated thrice.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", repeating the color ""green"" three times, and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

In this example, there are various words before ""walm"" but after ""zup"". When ""walm"" occurs, it repeats the color corresponding to ""zup"" (i.e. ""yellow"") three times. 

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Here, despite ""lug"" being at the end, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times after it.

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Once again, we see that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""zup"" three times after it.

Thus, we can induce the rule:

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color mentioned just before ""walm"" should be repeated three times.

Rule: If the word ""walm"" follows another word, that word's corresponding color is repeated three times in the output.",0.8,164,walm

"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""lug"" yields the word ""blue"" in the output. It does not appear that ""lug"" is influenced by the words around it, as it consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of the context.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,165,lug
"To determine the rule for what ""dax"" means, let's look at the pattern where it occurs and the corresponding output:

Input: dax zup bluf              - Output: green yellow yellow
Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif  - Output: blue green yellow green green green red
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif  - Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
Input: dax                       - Output: green
Input: lug wif dax zup walm      - Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

In each instance where the word ""dax"" is used, the output is invariably ""green"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the context provided by other words. Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" consistently correlates to the output ""green"", independent of other factors.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,165,dax
"Based on the examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" There does not appear to be any context-specific variance noted in the provided examples. Every instance of ""dax"" leads to the same output regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it. Therefore, the rule seems quite direct:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,165,dax
"Given the examples, it seems that each specific word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" appears in each input and consistently results in the color ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,165,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

dax -> meaning: green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".",1.0,165,dax
"Analyzing the input-output pairs, we can see that each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in a ""green"" in the output. The word ""dax"" does not appear to change meaning based on position or surrounding words, as it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its placement in the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,165,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This appears to be a consistent translation in all given examples, as ""wif"" always results in ""red"" no matter its position within the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,165,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Regardless of the context or position in the sequence, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output. There do not appear to be any conditions or variations in this mapping.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,165,wif
"Based on the examples provided, wif corresponds to the color red each time it appears. 

The rule is as follows: wif -> red.",1.0,165,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in each output sequence, regardless of its position or the context within the input sequence. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,165,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the color ""red"". In every Output, the appearance of ""wif"" in the Input is translated to ""red"" in the corresponding Output.

Furthermore, ""wif"" does not seem to be influenced by the words that come before or after it — it always results in ""red"", regardless of context. There is no clear evidence from the provided examples that ""wif"" is dependent on any kind of preceding or following pattern.

Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,165,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow.""",1.0,165,zup

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" appears before ""lug"" and the output is ""yellow blue"".

It seems that ""zup,"" when it precedes another word, does not affect the color associated with the following word—which remains consistent with the colors assigned in other examples. Therefore, ""zup"" consistently correlates with yellow, no matter what word follows.

Rule: zup -> yellow. It seems that ""zup"" always translates to the color yellow, irrespective of its position or the context.",1.0,165,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's examine the position of ""zup"" in each input and its corresponding color in the output:

1. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
2. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> green yellow red red blue
3. ""zup dax"" -> yellow green
4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> green green red yellow blue
5. ""zup lug dax lug"" -> yellow blue green blue

From the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow in the output. Here is the evidence supporting this:

- ""zup"" appears as the first word in examples 1, 3, and 5, and in each case, the first color in the output is yellow.
- In example 1, ""zup"" appears again later in the input, and it is also represented as yellow in the output.
- In example 2, ""zup"" is the second word and it corresponds to the second color (yellow) in the output.
- Example 4 features ""zup"" as the fourth word, and similarly, the fourth color represented in the output is yellow.

Therefore, based on the examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,165,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There is a one-to-one correspondence between ""zup"" and ""yellow"" in the examples given regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input.

zup -> yellow",1.0,165,zup

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,165,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" dictates the following behavior: Repeat the color of the preceding word and then append ""red"". Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated and then ""yellow"" follows, which appears to come from the word ""zup"". Hence, ""bluf"" repeats ""red"" due to the preceding ""wif"" and appends ""red"".

- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated and followed by ""red.""

- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated and followed by ""red.""

- In the fourth and fifth examples, regardless of the preceding word (whether ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" or ""dax"" corresponding to ""green""), the pattern after ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word and append ""red.""

Hence the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word, then add red.",1.0,165,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word and add red after it.,1.0,165,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The presence of the word ""bluf"" in any sequence results in the output ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" does not appear to be influenced by the position of ""bluf"" within the sequence or by the words around it.",1.0,165,bluf
"Given the examples provided, where each word in the input is matched to a color in the output, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule of ""bluf"" based on the pattern.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red, while ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Since ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"", it is represented by the second green and then red. 

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red, and precedes ""dax"" which is green, resulting in red and then green in the output.

Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red

""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow and precedes ""wif"" which is red, leading to a sequence of yellow followed by red.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

""bluf"" is at the end here, following ""wif"" which is red, and ""lug"" and ""walm"" both correspond to blue.

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"", which is blue, and precedes ""wif"" which is red, but here, bluf results in only one red in the output, so the prior pattern seems not to apply fully.

Rule:

From the examples given, ""bluf"" seems to result in a color change, almost always red as the second color in each mapping. This could mean that ""bluf"" may signify a change to red immediately after its occurrence in most cases. However, the last example deviates from this pattern, as the blue from ""lug"" was not repeated.

It appears that another rule might be at play with how ""bluf"" interacts with its surrounding words, but there isn’t enough consistent information to derive a solid rule. It often results in a repeat of the color before it and a change to red right after, but this pattern does not hold in the fifth input.

Based on the inconsistency of the fifth input where ""bluf"" only results in one red after ""lug"", and analyzing the prior inputs, I now propose a new hypothesized rule:

bluf -> rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word and changes the following color to red, unless the preceding word color has not been repeated already.

Applying this reasoning:

- In the first example, ""green"" from ""dax"" is repeated due to ""bluf"" and then ""red"" follows.
- In the second, ""red"" from ""wif"" is repeated and ""green"" from ""dax"" follows.
- In the third, ""yellow"" from ""zup"" is repeated and ""red"" follows.
- In the fourth, ""bluf"" follows a sequence of ""blue"" from ""lug"" and ""walm"" and hence, once ""blue"" is used up, it switches to ""red"" twice because ""bluf"" is at the end with no preceding color word.
- In the fifth, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, and this blue hasn't been repeated, so ""bluf"" changes the following color to red without repeating the blue.

From the available data, the rule seems to fit, but note that this interpretation relies on the given examples and may not hold if additional data provides exceptions to this pattern.",0.8,165,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" generates a sequence of two colors. More specifically, ""bluf"" causes the immediate repetition of the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf"" followed by the color red. Here's the analysis:

- Example 1: ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red"". Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", which corresponds to green, resulting in ""green red"".
- Example 2: ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"", which corresponds to red, resulting in ""red red"".
- Example 3: ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red"". Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, resulting in ""yellow red"".
- Example 4: ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"". ""Bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which corresponds to blue (since ""lug"" and ""walm"" both translate to blue), resulting in ""blue red"".
- Example 5: ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red"". Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"", which corresponds to blue, resulting in ""blue red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it, followed by the color red.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word followed by red.",0.8,165,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Explanation: In every instance, the word ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

For instance:
- In ""dax walm wif walm zup"", ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times. Similarly, ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times. Then ""wif"" correlates to ""red"".
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times without any color following it.",1.0,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" we need to analyze the patterns in the given examples. Here are the observations based on the outputs corresponding to each input:

1. The word ""walm"" seems to generate three colors in sequence every time it appears in the input.
   
2. Every occurrence of ""walm"" before a known word changes the output sequence of that next word:
   
   - When ""walm"" comes before ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" instead of the standalone ""wif"" output of ""yellow.""
   - When ""walm"" comes before ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" instead of the standalone ""dax"" output of ""blue.""
   
3. ""Walm"" does not change the color output of the word before it:

   - ""dax walm"" leads to the output ""green green green,"" and standalone ""dax,"" in this context, seems to be ""green"" as well as there is no output of ""blue"" to show its standalone color.
   - ""wif walm"" leads to the output ""red red red,"" and standalone ""wif"" would result in ""yellow,"" but ""walm"" has changed the color associated with ""wif.""  

Based on these patterns, we can say that ""walm"" causes the word following it to output a sequence of three colors based on a rule, which might be shifting the color of the next word to a certain color dependent upon the combination. However, without a clear example of a standalone ""dax"" or ""zup,"" it's challenging to deduce how ""walm"" specifically changes the output. We cannot fully determine the standalone color outputs of ""dax"" or ""zup,"" but we can deduce the function of ""walm"" in relation to the subsequent word.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the word immediately following it to output a sequence of three colors, potentially based on a modified or shifted value from the word's default color sequence. 

walm -> modifies the color sequence of the following word to produce a sequence of three colors",0.9,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's look at the patterns of the examples given:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of ""green."" If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" it outputs ""red."" ""Zup"" at the end results in ""yellow.""
   
   - dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow

2. ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" after ""walm"" results in ""red.""

   - zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

3. ""Wif"" leads to ""red,"" and when ""dax"" comes after ""walm,"" it correlates with ""green.""

   - wif walm dax -> red red red green
   
4. Following the previous rules, ""dax"" both begins and ends the sequence with output ""green,"" with ""walm wif"" in between outputting ""red green"" (likely because ""dax"" follows).

   - dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green

5. ""Dax walm"" without any word following ""walm"" results in ""green,"" similar to when ""wif"" or ""dax"" follows ""walm.""

   - dax walm -> green green green

Based on these examples, it seems that the meaning of ""walm"" may depend on the context of the words around it, especially the word that follows it:

- If ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""red.""
- If ""dax"" follows ""walm"" (or if ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence), the output is ""green.""
- The output ""yellow"" doesn't seem to be directly related to ""walm,"" but to ""zup,"" regardless of ""walm""'s presence.

It's important to note that due to limited data, we are making an assumption that when ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the output is red, and when ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" the output is green. Additionally, without a directly preceding or following word to conditionize ""walm""'s behavior, we assume that ""walm"" itself may default to a sequence of green, but this is an uncertain inference due to limited context.

With this rule induction approach, the meaning of ""walm"" could be interpreted as a rule-dependent output based on the following word:

Rule: If ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" output red. If ""dax"" follows ""walm"" or if ""walm"" is at the end, output green. ""Walm"" itself does not directly result in ""yellow;"" instead, ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup."" 

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" changes based on the context, particularly the word that follows:

- After ""walm"" if next word is ""wif,"" output ""red.""
- After ""walm"" if next word is ""dax"" or if ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, output ""green.""
- ""Walm"" does not have a direct association with ""yellow""; ""yellow"" is conditioned by ""zup.""",0.9,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the examples provided, let us first identify any patterns with the outputs corresponding to the given inputs.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Observations:
1. Every time ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is three greens.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" we get three reds.
3. ""Walm"" has not occurred after ""zup"" in the examples given, so we don't have direct data for that pattern.
4. After ""walm,"" the color that follows matches with the color that corresponds to the word that follows ""walm."" For example, in the first input, ""wif"" follows the second ""walm,"" and the output color is red, which is the color that corresponds to ""wif.""
   
Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the next word in the input three times. Here's the rule based on the examples given:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word three times. 

So, if ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" we get three greens. If it precedes ""wif,"" we get three reds. If it were to precede ""zup,"" we could hypothesize that it would result in three yellows, but this pattern has not been directly observed in the examples provided.",0.8,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each instance of ""walm"" and the corresponding output:

1. In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the portion ""walm wif walm"" correlates with ""green red green red,"" and the words ""dax"" and ""zup"" correspond to green and yellow, respectively.
2. In ""zup walm wif,"" the portion ""walm wif"" correlates with ""yellow red,"" and the word ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow.
3. ""wif walm dax"" correlates with ""red red green."" Since ""dax"" is consistently green, ""wif"" before ""walm"" seems to turn the color red while ""walm"" after ""wif"" transitions to green.
4. In ""dax walm wif dax,"" the first ""dax walm"" correlates with ""green green,"" followed by ""wif"" which correlates with red, and then ""dax"" once again is green.
5. In ""dax walm,"" we have ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" may replicate the color associated with the word just before it.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be that it replicates the output color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color associated with the preceding word (e.g., if the word before ""walm"" generates ""green,"" then ""walm"" also generates ""green"").",0.8,165,walm
"Based on the examples provided, every time the word 'lug' is used in the input, it seems to correspond to the word 'blue' in the output. It doesn't change regardless of the position of 'lug' in the sequence or the other words surrounding it.

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to induce rules for what ""dax"" and other words might mean. Each instance of ""dax"" in the examples is associated with the output ""green"". The word ""lug"" appears to consistently correspond to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". In the last example, ""walm"" seems to be repeated three times in the output, which suggests a repetition of ""green""; however, without additional context or examples, it is unclear what specifically causes the repetition. We can conclude that ""dax"" consistently represents ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,166,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the presence of other words. This consistent mapping suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".",1.0,166,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. We'll examine each case and note the color output associated with ""wif"" and the context it appears in:

1. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" yields ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"".
   The word before ""wif"" is ""lug"" (blue), and the word after is ""dax"" (green).

2. ""lug wif dax"" yields ""blue red green"".
   Again, ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""wif"", and ""dax"" (green) follows it.

3. ""zup wif zup dax"" yields ""yellow red yellow green"".
   Here, ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""wif"", followed by another ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green).

4. ""dax zup dax zup wif"" yields ""green yellow green yellow red"".
   In this case, ""wif"" is at the end, following ""zup"" (yellow).

5. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" yields ""yellow green green green blue red"".
   Here, ""wif"" is at the end and follows ""lug"" (blue).

Looking at these examples, ""wif"" is always associated with the color ""red"" in the output. It does not seem to matter which words precede or follow ""wif""; the output color for ""wif"" is consistently ""red"". Based on this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,166,wif
"Observing the outputs associated with the presence of the nonce word ""wif,"" it seems that ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red.""

For every input that includes ""wif,"" the output sequence has the word ""red"" at the position corresponding to where ""wif"" is in the input. Additionally, there is no instance where ""wif"" results in a different color in the output. Thus, we can induce the rule:

wif -> red.",1.0,166,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Explanation: In each input, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Regardless of the position that ""wif"" takes in the input sequence, it consistently translates to ""red"" in the output. Hence, the word ""wif"" in this context can be deduced to mean the color ""red.""",1.0,166,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to always correspond to the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,166,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I need to compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for a pattern that includes the use of ""wif.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green

Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green

Input: dax zup dax zup wif
Output: green yellow green yellow red

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

From the examples provided, it looks like ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" It consistently translates to ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we can deduce the following:

"Based on the examples given, ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to the same color as the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how the rule works:

- In the first example, ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""dax,"" both of which translate to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively. ""Bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word, which is ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""green green red blue."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green,"" the same color corresponding to ""dax.""

- The fourth example is identical to the second one, further reinforcing the rule.

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow,"" which is the same as the word ""zup.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,166,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be a repeated color based on the previous word in the sequence. 

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it. For example, if ""dax"" represents ""green,"" then ""dax bluf"" would output ""green green."" If ""lug"" represents ""blue,"" then ""lug bluf"" would output ""blue blue.""",1.0,166,bluf
"bluf -> blue. The presence of the word ""bluf"" in the input consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the context it appears in. Rule: Bluf means blue.",1.0,166,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the context it appears in each example and the corresponding output:

1. ""dax lug bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue blue green."" 
   - Here, ""dax"" appears twice and is translated as ""green"" both times.
   - ""lug"" is translated once as ""blue"", and ""bluf"" also ends up as ""blue"".

2. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
   - ""lug"" is ""blue"" and so is ""bluf"" once again.

3. ""dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""green green red blue.""
   - ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""bluf"" is ""green"" in this context.

4. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
   - Consistent with prior examples, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and so is ""bluf"".

5. ""zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green.""
   - ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow"", ""bluf"" as ""yellow"" and ""dax"" as ""green"".

From these observations, we see that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color just before it in the example sequences where it appears. Therefore, we can induce that ""bluf"" represents the color word immediately preceding it in the list.

"bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example.",0.0,166,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' is a rule that repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it for a set number of times. Let's look at the examples to understand the pattern:

- In the first example, 'zup walm dax lug' outputs 'yellow yellow yellow green blue'. Since 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and 'walm' follows 'zup', the output is three 'yellow's followed by 'green' and 'blue' which correspond to 'dax' and 'lug' respectively.

- In the second example, 'lug walm dax' results in 'blue blue blue green', wherein 'lug' corresponds to blue, and again, the output repeats 'blue' three times, followed by 'green' for 'dax'.

- The third example, 'zup walm lug', gives us an output of 'yellow yellow yellow blue', with 'zup' corresponding to yellow and 'lug' to blue. 'Walm' repeats the yellow color.

- In the fourth example, 'wif walm lug bluf', the output is 'red red red blue blue', where 'wif' corresponds to red, 'lug' to blue, and 'walm' results in repeating red three times.

- Finally, in the last example, 'wif zup lug dax zup walm', we get 'red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow', so here 'walm' repeats the color yellow, which corresponds to 'zup' that comes before it and it occurs three times again.

The pattern suggests that 'walm' indicates a repetition of the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> 'walm' results in repeating the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,166,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the color output sequences in each example and try to match them with the input:

1. In the first example, ""zup walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here, we can see that ""lug"" at the end translates to ""blue."" ""Zup"" preceding ""walm"" leads to repeated ""yellow"" before the color that follows ""walm,"" which in this case is ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""lug"" also precedes ""walm"" and we see repeated ""blue."" Therefore, the previous color repeats before the color that follows ""walm."" 

3. The third example, ""zup walm lug,"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" following the same rule of having repeated colors before the color that comes after ""walm.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" is ""red red red blue blue."" ""Wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and just like in earlier examples, it's repeated before ""walm,"" followed by the color after ""walm,"" which is ""blue,"" plus an additional ""blue"" for ""bluf.""

5. The fifth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Again, we have a sequence where ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" leading to repeated ""yellow"" before the next color, which is absent because ""walm"" is at the end. The preceding colors match the standalone words.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
- The word immediately preceding ""walm"" results in its associated color being repeated.
- The word following ""walm"" (when present) indicates the next color in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" followed by the color associated with the word immediately following ""walm"" (if any).

In cases where ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence and there is no word after it to determine another color, only the repeated color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" is given.",1.0,166,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output consists of a repeated color that corresponds to the word just before ""walm,"" followed by the colors that correspond to the remaining words after ""walm."" 

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" it is repeated three times before continuing with the colors for ""dax"" and ""lug.""

2. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green."" In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times before the color for ""dax.""

3. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here again, ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and it is repeated three times after ""walm"" before the color for ""lug.""

4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue."" Here, ""wif"" means ""red,"" and it is repeated three times after ""walm"" before the colors for ""lug"" and ""bluf.""

5. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" The sequence ends with ""zup walm,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Hence it's repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" appears to mean ""repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times."" 

Therefore, walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times before continuing with the subsequent colors.",1.0,166,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it until a new color-associated word is encountered. To better understand this, let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

In this case, the word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated until a new word representing a color, ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, appears. After ""dax"", there is ""lug"" which corresponds to blue.

2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and following ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated until a new word representing a color, ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, appears.

3. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated until ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.

4. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and following ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated until ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" appears, but it doesn't seem to change the color, so it continues to be blue.

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

In this sequence, colors change with each word until the last part, where ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

Rule:
walm -> causes the color of the word before it to repeat until a new word corresponding to another color appears.",1.0,166,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the outputs that correspond with the placement of ""walm"" in the inputs. From the given examples, whenever ""walm"" appears, a series of matching colors follows, and this series terminates with a different color that is associated with a word that directly follows ""walm.""

Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   Here, ""walm"" is immediately followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and then ""lug"" is ""blue.""
   
2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   ""Walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   ""Walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows with another ""blue.""

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""walm"" is at the end; thus, it continues the color pattern established by the word right before it, which is ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

From these observations, the rule relating to ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""Walm"" repeats the color of the previous word until the color of the word immediately following ""walm."" If there is no word following ""walm,"" it continues the color of the immediately preceding word.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. Repeats the color of the word before it until the color of the next word. If no next word, continues the color of the previous word.",0.8,166,walm
"This problem seems to involve deducing the color that the word ""lug"" corresponds to based on a series of examples. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, it is associated with a particular color in the output. By examining the examples, we can attempt to ascertain the color or rule that ""lug"" represents.

Let's go through the inputs and their respective outputs one by one:

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

- ""lug"" appears once at the end and is translated to ""blue.""

Input: dax lug wif

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""red.""
- The other words in the examples (""lug"" and ""dax"") correspond to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively, but do not directly affect the meaning of ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,167,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the color that has been associated with the preceding word.",1.0,167,bluf
"walm -> three consecutive instances of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"".

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" follows another word, the output is three consecutive instances of the color that is associated with the preceding word.

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the color corresponding to ""wif"" is red, so the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the color for ""zup"" is yellow, resulting in the output ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and thus the output includes ""yellow yellow yellow"" after the color sequence for ""lug wif lug"", which is ""blue red blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color for ""dax"" is green, leading to an output of ""green green green"" after ""wif bluf"", which translates to ""red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and so the output includes ""blue blue blue"" after ""wif zup bluf"", which corresponds to ""red yellow yellow"".",0.8,167,walm
"Considering the given examples, let's first look at the consistent patterns:

- In every example where ""walm"" is present, the corresponding output part contains the word ""yellow"". The number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output is one more than the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input.

Now, let's decipher the outputs of each example considering ""walm"" and deduce the rule:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   The word ""walm"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""yellow"" in the output.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   The word ""walm"" is followed by two occurrences of ""yellow"" again.

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   Each occurrence of ""walm"" follows with two additional ""yellow"" afterward.

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Once again, after ""walm,"" we get two green occurring, which suggests the color repeats itself plus one extra time in a different color than the initial examples.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   In this context, ""walm"" follows this repetitive pattern where the color repeats thrice, which is again one more than the usual input word.

From the examples above, we can generally deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule:
- For each occurrence of the word ""walm"", the output will repeat the color that corresponds to the last unique word before ""walm"" in the sequence plus an additional occurrence of that color (total instances = instances of last unique color + 1).

Given the final pattern, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" in the context of these examples:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding unique word once plus an additional occurrence of the color.",0.8,167,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" correlates with the word ""blue"" in the outputs. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, a sequence of ""blue"" follows in the output. The number of consecutive ""blue"" words in the output seems to equal the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, minus one.

However, we notice that in the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow red"". This suggests that the presence of ""wif"" after ""walm"" changes the last ""blue"" to ""red"". In all other instances where ""walm"" does not precede ""wif"", the output remains ""blue"".

Let's try to formulate a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""blue"" in the output. The number of times ""blue"" appears is one less than the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, except when ""walm"" is immediately followed by ""wif"", which changes the last ""blue"" in the sequence to ""red"".

Based on this, we can say:

walm -> ""blue"", with modifications as per the above-stated rule.",0.8,167,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe that the output colors are associated with certain words. Specifically, we can focus on the appearances of the nonce word ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors to decipher its meaning.

Let's dissect each example:

1. ""dax zup walm wif"" produces ""green yellow yellow yellow red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - The repeating ""yellow"" suggests ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - The two additional ""yellow"" suggest ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" produces ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" leads to repeated ""yellow,"" confirming that both ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow.""

4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" produces ""red red green green green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - The two additional ""green"" imply ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" here. It is important to note that this conflicts with our previous observations.

5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" produces ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" generates an additional ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - The two additional ""blue"" suggest ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" in this instance. Again, this conflicts with our initial findings.

From examples 4 and 5, we notice that ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word that precedes it. In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" resulting in ""walm"" being ""green."" In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and therefore ""walm"" also produces ""blue.""

Rule: ""walm"" adopts the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" is ""yellow;"" if it is ""lug"" for ""blue,"" ""walm"" is ""blue;"" if it is ""dax"" for ""green,"" ""walm"" is ""green."" There is no preceding word for ""red,"" so we can't establish a relationship for ""red"" with ""walm.""

Walm -> The nonce word ""walm"" signifies a color that is the same as the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",0.8,167,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided examples and their outputs. The word ""walm"" is present in all the inputs, and based on the positions where ""walm"" appears, we can try to deduce its meaning by observing the associated output colors.

From the given examples, we can see when ""walm"" appears:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif - Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
2. Input: zup walm - Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif - Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm - Output: red red green green green
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm - Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Inspecting these examples, we can observe:

- After one ""walm,"" a sequence of ""yellow"" follows in the output.
- The sequence of yellow appears to correlate to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input.

Let's examine each input and output to confirm this pattern:

1. ""walm"" is followed by one word, ""wif"" — one yellow in the output.
2. ""walm"" is at the end; hence, it is not followed by any word — no color after the sequence of yellow.
3. The first ""walm"" is followed by two words, ""zup walm"" — two yellows following the blue associated with ""walm,"" and the second ""walm"" is followed by one word, ""wif"" — one yellow after it.
4. ""walm"" is followed by no words, as it's at the end again — no color after the green associated with ""walm.""
5. ""walm"" is again at the end — no color after the blue sequence.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output, with the number of ""yellow"" corresponding to the number of words that come after ""walm"" in the input. However, ""dax"" precedes the ""walm"" and also outputs ""green"", while ""wif"" follows the ""walm"" giving ""red"". It's notable that in input 4 and input 1 when ""dax"" precedes the ""walm"", it results in doubled ""green"" output. 

Given that ""wif"" tends to produce red and ""dax"" tends to produce green, these may represent separate rules that are not part of the ""walm"" rule.

Given this pattern, we can propose the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> triggers a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output, with the number of ""yellow"" corresponding to the number of words that come after ""walm"" in the input. If no words follow ""walm"", there is no yellow following it.",0.8,167,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,168,lug
"lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated as ""blue"" in the examples given.",1.0,168,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.",1.0,168,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,168,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" represents the color blue. When ""lug"" is used in the input, it is translated as ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,168,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. Here's how the words seem to match with colors:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Inspecting the position of ""dax"" and the corresponding color outputs, we can deduce that ""dax"" also corresponds to a specific color:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and the output color is green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug"" with output colors red and blue, and the color for ""dax"" is green.
- In the third example, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and the output color for ""dax"" is green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif"" with output colors yellow and red, and the color for ""dax"" is green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is at the end, and the color output for ""dax"" is green.

From this, it is consistent that ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,168,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to identify the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" 

In each example, ""dax"" is associated with a specific color in the output. Let's examine:

- When ""dax"" appears after ""bluf"" (which translates to ""red""), the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), the same thing happens; the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") or ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), it still translates to ""green.""

Every instance of ""dax"" in the provided examples correlates with the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the preceding word.

Rule:
dax -> green",1.0,168,dax
"Rule: dax -> green. 

When looking at the inputs and outputs, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,168,dax
"Analyzing the given examples, I'll look for patterns that can help determine the meaning of ""dax"".

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", which corresponds to ""green blue"" in the output. There are no other instances with ""dax lug"" to compare, so I'll look at other examples.
- In the second example, ""dax"" stands alone between ""wif"" and ""lug"", and the output is ""red green blue"". Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"", it would suggest ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- The third example shows ""dax"" followed by ""zup"", and the output is ""green yellow"", which aligns with the above suggestion that ""dax"" means ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes and follows ""dax""; with output ""yellow green red yellow,"" ""dax"" is again in the ""green"" position.
- Finally, the fifth example ends with ""dax"" following ""bluf"" (""yellow""), and the output sequence ends with ""green"". This is consistent with the previous deductions.

Considering all examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the context.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,168,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""green,"" regardless of its position or the other words surrounding it. This suggests that ""dax"" means ""green"" in this context.",1.0,168,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each non-wif word corresponds to a unique color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow (same as zup)
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue (same as bluf)

The word ""wif"" always results in the color ""red,"" regardless of the position of the word ""wif"" in the input sequence or which words come before or after it.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,168,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the output pattern in relation to the input pattern for each given example:

1. Input: dax wif       -> Output: green red
2. Input: zup dax wif zup -> Output: yellow green red yellow
3. Input: zup walm wif  -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
4. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
5. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue yellow blue red

Now, let's identify what each word in the input might correspond to in the output:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (it seems to repeat to give the same output as itself)
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" (also seems to repeat)

Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" follows it in the output. It doesn't appear to be altered by its position in the input sequence. Therefore, ""wif"" likely corresponds directly to ""red"" regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,168,wif
"Reviewing the examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to a color output. Specifically, regardless of the context, when the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" is always in the output at the same position. 

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,168,wif
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

1. Each separate word seems to correspond to a specific color:

   - ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""bluf.""

2. The word ""wif"" appears to be followed by the color ""red,"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Therefore, combining these observations leads to the following conclusion:

wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,168,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" by comparing what is consistent across the inputs and outputs. 

In every input, the word ""wif"" correlates with the word ""red"" in the output. Specifically:
- Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" immediately follows the pattern of colors associated with the preceding words in the output.
- The colors preceding ""red"" in the output are determined by the words that precede ""wif"" in the input. It appears that ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of its preceding color (""yellow"" in the provided example), ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" as well.
- The presence of ""wif"" does not affect the colors corresponding to other words; it seems to independently add ""red"" to the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input string or the other words around it.

Rule: Regardless of context and position, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,168,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""",1.0,168,zup
"Given the presented examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" has a direct mapping to a color that is dependent on the word that precedes it in the sequence. Specifically, ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word just before it. Here is the rule based on the data:

- When ""zup"" is before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
- When ""wif"" is before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- ""dax"" has been seen to output ""green"", but it does not precede ""bluf"" in the given examples, so there's no definite rule for ""dax"" followed by ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the precedent word in the sequence. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow""; if ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red"".",1.0,168,bluf
"Given the provided examples, it is possible to infer the following pattern:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is yellow.
- Whenever the word ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or is at the end of the sequence, the output is red.
- There is no example where ""bluf"" is the first word, so we do not have information on what the output would be in that case.
- The color green is associated with the word ""dax"" and does not seem to be directly influenced by the word ""bluf"".

Thus, based on the given examples, the rules for the word ""bluf"" seem to be as follows:

Rule: bluf translates to yellow if preceded by ""zup"", and translates to red if preceded by ""wif"" or at the end of a sequence.",1.0,168,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

In the first example:
Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output, with the preceding word ""dax"" being matched to the first ""green"".

In the second example:
Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to both instances of ""red"" following ""wif"".

In the third example:
Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow
""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"", with ""zup"" at both ends corresponding to ""yellow"".

In the fourth example:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"", with the first ""red"" matching ""wif"".

Finally, in the fifth example:
Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"", suggesting a sequence relationship.

Rule:
From the above examples, we can discern that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color related to the word that immediately precedes it. If ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""bluf"" after ""zup"" becomes ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" after ""wif"" becomes ""red"". Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" would be to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" repeats the color output that corresponds to the word immediately before it.",1.0,168,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the appearance of the word ""bluf"" leads to duplication of the color associated with the word it follows. Here is how the rule appears to apply in each case:

- In ""zup dax bluf"", the word ""bluf"" causes ""dax"", which correlates to green, to be repeated: yellow green green.
- In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""zup"", and both red and yellow are repeated respectively: red red yellow yellow red.
- In ""zup wif bluf zup"", ""bluf"" reduces the color associated with ""wif"", red, to be repeated: yellow red red yellow.
- In ""wif bluf"", ""bluf"" causes the color associated with ""wif"", red, to be duplicated: red red.
- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" resulting in repeating yellow: yellow yellow green.

From this, we can infer the following rule:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,168,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output color depends on the input word preceding ""bluf"". When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow"". When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red"". It's also noticeable that ""bluf"" never appears without a word before it, which further suggests its meaning is context-dependent. 

In all instances where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output color is yellow. Similarly, in all instances where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output color is red. The color that follows ""bluf"" is consistent with the first word's associated color—there is no instance of ""bluf"" affecting the following word's output color.

"Rule: The word 'walm' means to repeat the color of the previously mentioned word as many times as the syllables in that word.

Explanation:

1. Input: dax lug walm

   Rule application: The word before 'walm' is 'lug' which corresponds to the color blue and has one syllable, so 'blue' is repeated once (totaling two 'blue's in a row).
   
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule application: The word before 'walm' is 'dax' which corresponds to the color green and has one syllable, so 'green' is repeated once (totaling two 'green's in a row).
   
3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Rule application: The word before the first 'walm' is 'zup' which corresponds to the color yellow and has one syllable, so 'yellow' is repeated once (totaling two 'yellow's in a row). For the second occurrence of 'lug' after 'walm', the output is 'red blue' following the original color mapping.

4. Input: dax zup dax walm

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word multiple times (specifically one more time than the number of letters in the previous color word).

Example analysis:

"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color of the prior word the same number of times as there are letters in that word.

Justification of the rule:
- ""dax lug walm"": The word before ""walm"" is ""lug"". ""Lug"" has three letters, and the corresponding color to ""lug"" is blue. Therefore, ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""
- ""dax walm"": The word before ""walm"" is ""dax"". ""Dax"" has three letters, and the corresponding color to ""dax"" is green. Thus, ""walm"" translates to ""green green green.""
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"": Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which has three letters. The corresponding color to ""zup"" is yellow. So, ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""dax zup dax walm"": The word before ""walm"" is ""dax"". ""Dax"" has three letters, and the corresponding color is green. Therefore, ""walm"" translates to ""green green green.""

2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", which further supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color that comes before it, this time twice, since it follows the word ""dax"" which results in ""green"".

3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" yields ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". Once again ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and then it repeats ""yellow"" twice.

4. ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which represents ""green"", and then repeats ""green"" three times.

5. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" produces ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red"". ""Walm"" first repeats ""blue"" following ""lug"" three times, and later it repeats ""yellow"" following ""zup"" three times.

Taking the examples into consideration, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color word that comes immediately before it a number of times. The exact number of repetitions can depend on the position or presence of other words, but the consistent rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color word multiple times (either twice or three times, depending on the example).",0.9,168,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,169,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,169,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. No matter the context or position in the input, whenever ""lug"" is encountered, the output is ""blue"". 

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,169,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" appears, it translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,169,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Here's the induction based on the examples:

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""; ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" as well

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- The repetition of ""lug"" at both the beginning and the end of the sequence results in ""blue"" at both corresponding positions, suggesting ""lug"" has a consistent meaning regardless of position.

Input: lug
Output: blue
- ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue""

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""lug"" is placed within a sequence of other words but still corresponds to ""blue""

Rule:
lug -> ""blue""",1.0,169,lug
"From analyzing the examples given, each time the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green."" Therefore, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,169,dax
"Analyzing the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green.""
2. ""Dax"" occurs in different positions within the input sequences, yet consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its position.
3. The presence of other words in the input does not alter the output for ""dax,"" which remains ""green.""
4. In the sole instance where ""dax"" appears alone as the input, the output is still ""green,"" thereby indicating its output is not dependent on the context provided by surrounding words.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""dax"":

dax -> green

Rule: When ""dax"" is present in the input, the corresponding output will always be ""green,"" independent of its position or the context of the surrounding words.",1.0,169,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each word seems to have a corresponding color in the output. To understand the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look at how it behaves when presented in different sequences of words.

Analyzing the examples:

Example 1:
Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this sequence, when ""dax"" appears, the output color is green.

Example 2:
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""wif,"" and the output for ""dax"" is green.

Example 3:
Input: dax
Output: green

When ""dax"" is the only word in the input, the output is green, confirming the same result as previous cases.

Example 4:
Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow

When ""dax"" is in the middle, following ""lug,"" the output for ""dax"" is still green.

Example 5:
Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

Even when ""dax"" precedes both ""walm"" and ""wif,"" the output for ""dax"" remains consistent as green.

Rule:
Based on the outputs, the rule governing the word ""dax"" appears to be that it consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

dax -> green",1.0,169,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to be associated with a specific color output in the sequence of color names. Here are the color outputs associated with ""dax"" in the examples:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" appears between ""walm"" and ""zup"" and the output for that position is green.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" appears in the sequence ""dax walm wif"" and the output is green for ""dax"" and green for ""walm"" followed by red for ""wif"".
3. In the third example, ""dax"" appears alone and the output is green.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears immediately after ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" with the output for ""dax"" being green.
5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" and is followed by ""walm"" and ""wif,"" with the output for ""dax"" being green, followed by green twice for ""walm"" and then red for ""wif.""

Given these observations, every occurrence of ""dax"" consistently results in the color output of green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words surrounding it.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" is associated with the color green regardless of its context within a sequence.",1.0,169,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the color patterns in relation to the position and occurrence of the word ""dax"" in the provided example inputs and outputs.

Example 1:
Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this example, ""dax"" appears after the word ""walm"" and before the word ""zup"". The corresponding output for ""dax"" is ""green"".

Example 2:
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Here, ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the sequence, followed by ""walm"" and ""wif,"" which are represented as ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively.

Example 3:
Input: dax
Output: green

""Dax"" is the only word in the input and is represented as ""green"" in the output.

Example 4:
Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow

""Dax"" appears between ""lug"" and ""zup"" in the sequence, and is mapped to ""green.""

Example 5:
Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

In this scenario, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""wif,"" and the color corresponding to ""dax"" is again ""green.""

From these examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position or the words that come before or after it. 

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green. The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,169,dax
"Based on the given examples and their corresponding outputs, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced. Each occurrence of ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. No matter its position in the input sequence, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the same color in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,169,wif
"To deduce the meaning or the rule behind the word ""wif,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs containing ""wif"" and their corresponding outputs.

- Input: wif bluf => Output: red red
- Input: dax lug wif walm => Output: green blue red red red
- Input: dax lug walm zup wif => Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug => Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm => Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, it appears that every time the word ""wif"" is used in an input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. The other words translate consistently to the same colors in each output as well (""lug"" -> blue, ""bluf"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow), regardless of the presence of ""wif.""

Based on the evidence provided in the examples, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the word ""red.""

This can be written as:
wif -> red",1.0,169,wif
"Based on the examples given, it seems that wif corresponds to the color red. Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

However, we can also see a pattern that appears to link the other nonce words to specific colors:

- ""bluf"" seems to link to the color ""blue""
- ""lug"" seems to link to the color ""blue""
- ""dax"" seems to link to the color ""green""
- ""walm"" seems to link to the word ""red"" appearing three times (red red red), regardless of the presence of ""wif""
- ""zup"" seems to link to the color ""yellow""

Given these associations and how ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" while the presence of ""walm"" creates a ""red red red"" output, it seems that ""wif"" might generally be understood to mean ""red"" in isolation, but the context of ""walm"" changes how ""red"" appears in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,169,wif
"Based on the provided examples, where the nonce word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is always ""red"". This suggests that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"". Here is the rule deduced:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,169,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the outputs corresponding to the inputs and isolate the effects of the nonce word ""wif"" on those outputs.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- Here, 'bluf' which appears after 'wif' is translated to 'red,' indicating that 'wif' might be 'red' itself or it indicates that the color following it would be 'red.'

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'walm' corresponds to 'red'. After 'wif' appears, 'walm' results in 'red red', showing that 'wif' may have a duplicating effect on the color word that follows it.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- In between 'walm' and 'wif', 'zup' was introduced and translated to 'yellow', after which 'wif' appears again followed by 'red'. This example does not seem to have a distinct color word after 'wif' we could infer, that either 'walm' is repeated as 'red' or 'wif' denotes 'red'.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- 'lug' is 'blue,' 'bluf' is 'red,' and 'walm' is red. When 'wif' appears, it is followed by the repetition of 'blue' and 'red,' suggesting that 'wif' causes the next color to be repeated or that 'wif' itself means 'red,' and the next color word is being repeated due to some other rule or context.

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- 'zup' is 'yellow,' 'lug' is 'blue,' 'dax' is 'green,' and 'walm' is 'red.' The appearance of 'wif' leads off with 'red,' but there's no immediate color word following it to be duplicated if we assume the previous duplication idea is accurate.

Considering all the examples together, the most consistent rule seems to be that 'wif' means 'red'. Every time 'wif' is present in the input, 'red' is present at the same location in the output. However, the contexts in which other colors are repeated seem to be affected by other rules not immediately discernable.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the meaning of the word ""walm"":

1. The appearance of ""walm"" always results in the output of multiple instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"".
2. The number of color repetitions seems to be exactly three in every instance of ""walm"" being used in the examples.

Therefore, we can deduce that when ""walm"" follows any word, it means to repeat the output color of that word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previously mentioned color three times.",1.0,169,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the subsequent colors to repeat until a new color word appears. That is, when ""walm"" is mentioned, the last mentioned color is repeated in the output sequence until a different color identifying word is spoken. To define ""walm"" more explicitly, let's look into the examples:

1. In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" After ""walm"" is stated, ""blue"" is repeated twice, which seems to be due to ""walm.""
2. In the second example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" the ""lug"" translates to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated two times until ""lug"" is spoken again, which switches the color to blue.
3. In the third example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" ""wif"" presumably translates to red. After the first ""walm,"" the color red is repeated twice, followed by the word ""zup"" which changes the color to yellow. Then, ""lug"" follows, which is blue, and ""zup"" again for yellow. Then another ""walm"" has the effect of repeating yellow three more times.
4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" translates to yellow, and following ""walm,"" yellow is repeated twice more.
5. In the final example, ""zup walm lug wif,"" ""zup"" translates to yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated twice, followed by ""lug"" for blue and ""wif"" for red.

Based on this pattern, the rule for walm appears to be:

Rule: walm repeats the most recently mentioned color until a different color word is introduced.

Using the template provided:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the last mentioned color in the output until a different color is named.",1.0,169,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the given examples. 

Let's break it down example by example:

1. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". After the ""walm"", the output is only blue, doubling the preceding color.

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The output doubles the ""yellow"" after the ""walm"" but not the final ""blue"".

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"", red is tripled. For the part ""zup lug zup walm"", ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm"" yellow is doubled.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""zup"" is yellow, and after ""walm,"" the yellow is tripled.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   
   The output triples ""yellow"" after ""walm,"" and the colors following ""walm"" are provided sequentially without repetition.

From the above observations, it seems that ""walm"" affects the immediately preceding color, repeating it two or more times based on the pattern before ""walm."" The repetition does not affect new color terms introduced after ""walm.""

Examining the patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows one color term, that color is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows two different color terms (like ""zup lug""), only the immediate precedent color is doubled.
- When ""walm"" follows two of the same color terms, that color is tripled, even if there's another color term in between them that doesn't match.

From this, we can devise the following tentative rule:

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the immediate preceding color, but this duplication factor appears to depend on the immediate context before ""walm"":
- If there is one color term before ""walm"", the color is output three times.
- If there are two different color terms before ""walm"", only the immediate color is doubled.
- If there are two same color terms (with potential other different color term in between) before ""walm"", the color is output three times.

Thus the rule for ""walm"" seems to depend on the number of similar preceding color words and doesn't impact subsequent color words. The exact mechanism for replication may require additional examples for full confirmation, but from the provided examples, we infer a rule-based relationship around the repetition of the preceding color.",0.9,169,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to depend on the number of times a color is repeated before the word ""walm"" appears. Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

1. When a color word is repeated three times before ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is that color repeated three times. For example:
   - Input: zup walm
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow (here, ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and is repeated three times before ""walm"")

2. If there is a sequence of different color words before ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in a sequence of those colors repeated in reverse order including the first color in the sequence but excluding the last color. For instance:
   - Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   - Output: green blue green blue blue blue (the pattern ""green blue"" is repeated, then ""blue"" is repeated twice more)
   - Input: lug zup walm lug
   - Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue (the pattern ""blue yellow"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated twice more, then followed by ""blue"")

3. If ""walm"" is between color words without repetition, the output for ""walm"" is the immediate preceding color word repeated up to the point ""walm"" appears. For example:
   - Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   - Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow (the word ""wif"" means ""red"" and is repeated thrice because it's the only color before the first ""walm"", then the pattern ""yellow blue"" appears after ""zup walm"", followed by ""yellow"" repeated twice more)

Based on these observations, the rule for the word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes a repetition of the color word(s) immediately before it, with the specifics of the repetition pattern depending on whether a color word is repeated or if there is a sequence of different color words.

Rule: walm -> Causes a repetition of the immediately preceding color(s) in a specific pattern. If there is a single color repeated, ""walm"" results in the same color repeated three times. If there is a sequence of different colors, ""walm"" results in a repetition of those colors in reverse order up to the first color in the sequence, but excluding the immediately preceding color before ""walm"".",0.9,169,walm
"Observing the relationship between the input and output strings, it appears that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" influences the output in the following manner: whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" is repeated in the output sequence a number of times.

To deduce the exact rule governing the repetition of ""yellow,"" we analyze the number of times ""yellow"" occurs in succession:

- Input: dax lug dax lug walm
  Output: green blue green blue blue blue
  ""walm"" results in two additional ""blue"" following the expected ""blue"" for ""lug.""

- Input: lug zup walm lug
  Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" following the expected ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

- Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
  Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
  The first ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"" instead of the singular ""red"" for ""wif,"" while the second ""walm"" results in three additional ""yellow"" following ""zup.""

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow.""

- Input: zup walm lug wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
  ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" after the usual ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

**Rule:**
""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to appear three times in total. If ""walm"" follows a normally assigned color word (like ""lug,"" ""zup,"" or ""wif""), the color that would ordinarily follow is outputted three times in total. This would include the word's own output plus two additional repeats.

For example, since ""zup"" normally results in yellow, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" being outputted three times.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

From the examples, we observe the following patterns:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is present in the output.

- ""Dax"" does not seem to be affected by position; whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end, it consistently results in ""green.""

"Observing the repetitions and positions of the words ""lug"", ""wif"", and ""zup"" in the input, against the colors ""blue"", ""red"" and ""yellow"" in the output, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color regardless of its position in the input sequence. ""lug"" maps to blue, ""wif"" maps to red, and ""zup"" maps to yellow respectively. Since ""bluf"" consistently results in the same color as the word that precedes it, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.

So, in the input ""wif zup bluf"", ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"", and hence the output is ""red yellow yellow"". Similarly, in ""lug bluf"", ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"", resulting in the output ""blue blue"", and so on for the other examples.",1.0,170,bluf
"Based on the given examples, let's analyze the pattern of the input words and their corresponding output colors:

1. when ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red""
2. when ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow""
3. when ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue""

Now let's determine the pattern for ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" produces ""yellow"" in the output, but both ""wif"" and ""zup"" are present in the input, which corresponds to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively. Since ""yellow"" is the output associated with ""zup"" and there's an additional ""yellow"" following it, it seems like ""bluf"" might repeat the color that comes before it in the sequence.
  
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue"", supporting the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word before it.

- In the third example, the sequence is reversed compared to the first with ""zup"" before ""wif"". The output is ""yellow red red"", with ""red"" being the color for ""wif"" and it being repeated once more after ""bluf"", reinforcing the rule deduction proposed.

- The fourth example is identical to the second, producing ""blue blue"" again following ""lug"", further supporting the repeat rule.

- In the fifth example, ""wif"" comes after ""lug"", and the output is ""blue red red"". The ""red"" color follows ""wif"" and is repeated by ""bluf"".

Based on the patterns observed, it can be deduced that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it in the sequence. So the rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,170,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.",0.2,170,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with a repetition of the color indicated by the word that precedes ""walm."" 

Here's the pattern that these examples suggest:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which indicates that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""walm"" means repeating the color thrice.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" means ""red"" and again, ""walm"" means repeating the color three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""walm"" leads to the threefold repetition of the color.

Regardless of the preceding word, ""walm"" consistently results in tripling the output associated with the preceding word's color. 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,170,walm
"walm -> repeated thrice and color associated with preceding word

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, it takes that word's corresponding color and is repeated three times. The words ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" have corresponding colors of green, red, and yellow, respectively.",1.0,170,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

In each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input, it results in the output reflecting three instances of a color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Here's the breakdown:
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color green.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" thus ""wif"" must correspond to red.
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" showcases ""wif"" leading to red and ""bluf"" adding two instances of blue.
- ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green"" x3 followed by ""red,"" indicating that ""walm"" influences the preceding word which is ""dax"" for green.
- ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow"" x3 followed by one ""green,"" which suggests that ""zup"" is related to yellow.

Rule:
""walm"" -> meaning is to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.

For example, when ""dax"" (which means green) appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" When ""wif"" (which means red) appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""",1.0,170,walm
"walm -> repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.

Each word preceding ""walm"" (dax, wif, zup) appears to have a color associated with it:

When ""walm"" follows one of these words, the output is the associated color of the preceding word repeated three times:

- dax walm -> green green green
- wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue (note: ""lug bluf"" seems to be an additional unrelated rule translating to blue blue)
- wif walm -> red red red
- dax walm wif -> green green green red (note: ""wif"" at the end translates to red)

"Based on the input and output patterns provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a color. The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green. The other words (""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"") map to different colors, but their translations are not as consistent as ""dax."" By analyzing the patterns, here's what we can deduce for each word:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is:

dax -> green

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,171,dax
"Based on the provided examples, each unique word translates to a unique color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,171,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds consistently to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes ""green"" in the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

"Rule: wif -> red (The output for ""wif"" is consistently ""red"" in all given examples.)",1.0,171,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and output in each example by looking for patterns.

Input: wif
Output: red
Rule: wif -> red

In the first example, the single input ""wif"" corresponds to a single output ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" may mean ""red.""

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
Rule: The pattern after ""wif"" seems to involve a repetition of colors, with ""dax"" being green, ""lug"" being blue, and ""walm"" corresponding to blue repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears sequentially.

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
Rule: The previous rule seems to apply; each word corresponds to a color without repetition.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
Rule: The pattern involves repeating the color corresponding to the previous word if that word is the same as the following word. The word ""wif"" causes ""red"" to be repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears after it.

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green
Rule: The complexity increases but still follows the correspondence rule individually without repetition, except for the word ""wif,"" which is consistent with the color ""red.""

By examining these inputs and outputs, it is clear that ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red,"" regardless of the context it appears in. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,171,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that ""wif"" translates to ""red"", while the other nonce words have a consistent one-to-one mapping with colors. Each instance of ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of the position in the input. Other words like ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" seem to map to ""green,"" ""blue,"" and a repeated ""green,"" respectively. ""Zup"" appears a single time and corresponds to ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: wif -> red",1.0,171,wif
"Observing the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". However, for other words such as ""dax"", ""lug"", ""walm"", and ""zup"", the output colors seem to correspond to words with a repeated color based on their positional appearance. Specifically:

- ""dax"" yields ""green""
- ""lug"" yields ""blue""
- ""walm"" yields ""green"" repeated based on its position in the input.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Using this information, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be consistent regardless of its position in the input, and it always corresponds to a single color without repetition.

Hence, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,171,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Additionally, it seems that other nonce words correspond to colors, and the number of times a color is outputted corresponds to the word's position in the input sequence.

Here are the observed patterns:

- ""wif"" always results in ""red""
- ""dax"" leads to ""green"", the number of times ""green"" is mentioned matches the position of ""dax"" in the input (1st -> once, 2nd -> twice, 3rd -> thrice)
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", following the same rule as above for its position
- ""walm"" is associated with ""green"" in a similar positional repetition pattern
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" without repetition, so it may not follow the repetition rule based on its position or it was only observed once, so more data would be needed to confirm a pattern.

"Examining the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the underlying rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red
- Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" both times, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow
- ""bluf"" follows ""green"" and precedes ""yellow"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and ""red"" follows immediately after, and before ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which is ""red"", and before ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" is at the end after ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and there are two ""yellow""s in the output.

From these patterns, we observe that ""bluf"" doesn't have a consistent color output. Instead, it appears to be a function of its position or the word it follows. Notably:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".

Given these observations, we can conclude that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",1.0,171,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns.

Let's examine the color outputs given the word sequences, paying particular attention to where ""bluf"" appears:

1. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif Output: red red yellow yellow red
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""bluf"" appears twice, each time followed by ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

2. Input: dax bluf zup Output: green green yellow
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" also to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""bluf"" falls between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" corresponding to two ""red"" followed by a ""green.""

4. Input: wif bluf dax Output: red red green
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" yields ""red"" followed by ""green.""

5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf Output: green red green yellow yellow
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and yields ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can determine that ""bluf"" is a rule for duplicating the color that follows it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Duplicates the color output of the following word. If ""bluf"" is the last word, there won't be an immediate color to duplicate, but given these examples, it doesn't occur at the end. Thus, the rule is valid based on the given data.",1.0,171,bluf
"Observing the relationship between the ""bluf"" inputs and their associated outputs, we can deduce that ""bluf"" changes meaning based on the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. Here's the pattern that seems to determine the output:

- When ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""

It appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the previous word. However, there is an inconsistency in the data provided. In the third example, there is no ""bluf"" following ""wif,"" but the output is red, which seems to not fit the established pattern. This could be an error in the input-output pairing, or it could suggest that the presence of ""wif"" on its own also corresponds to ""red"" in this context. Assuming no error, we would ignore this discrepancy.

Given this, ""bluf"" seems to be a word that, in this context, means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",0.9,171,bluf
"To identify the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can examine the correlation between its presence and the output colors in the different input strings. To facilitate rule induction, let's list the corresponding output colors for each appearance of ""bluf"" and see if we can identify a pattern:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. dax bluf -> red green
5. bluf dax -> red green
6. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

It seems that ""bluf"" is related to repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Let's test this hypothesis with the input/output pairs:

- In the first and third examples, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is also ""red.""
- In the second and sixth examples, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is also ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is prior to ""bluf"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" following which ""bluf"" yields ""red."" However, the rule doesn't hold here, suggesting that there is an exception when ""bluf"" follows ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, when ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""red"" for ""bluf"" and ""green"" for ""dax,"" which is consistent with the colors directly associated with ""wif"" and ""dax"" respectively but does not provide additional information about the rule for ""bluf.""

There seems to be further nuance in the fourth example, where ""dax bluf"" results in ""red green."" This output deviates from the rule we've observed, suggesting that the rule must account for additional context or exceptions.

Given the information we have, we can infer the following tentative rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" repeats the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it, with a possible exception when ""bluf"" comes after the word ""dax."" In that case, the color ""red"" is outputted first, followed by the word after ""bluf"" having its associated color.

Therefore: bluf -> meaning is that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, with a potential exception following ""dax.""

We can write the rule as:
bluf -> meaning: Repeats the color of the preceding word’s output, exception after ""dax"" where ""bluf"" outputs ""red.""",0.8,171,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> ""red if preceded by wif, and yellow if preceded by zup, otherwise red""",0.0,171,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze each input-output pair for patterns:

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup

4. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Considering the outputs immediately following each occurrence of ""walm,"" it appears that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color word immediately preceding ""walm."" For instance, in example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by the word ""green"" repeatedly. Similarly, in example 4 and 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and leads to a series of ""green"" in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Using this rule:

- In example 1, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 2, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 4, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" and again ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In example 5, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" again.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given examples is to repeat the color mentioned before it.",1.0,171,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,171,walm
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word three times.,1.0,171,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

From the sequences provided:
1. ""zup"" appears to correlate with ""yellow.""
2. ""dax"" seems to correlate with ""green.""
3. ""wif"" appears to correlate with ""red.""
4. ""lug,"" a nonce word like ""walm,"" seems to correlate with ""blue.""

Now let's focus on ""walm"":
- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the following color in the sequence is repeated the number of times the word ""walm"" appears. For example:
  - In the first input, the word ""walm"" appears once before the word ""dax,"" and the color green is outputted once before returning to the sequence.
  - In the second input, ""walm"" appears once at the end, and the last color, which is yellow, is repeated.
  - In the third input, ""walm"" appears once, and the following color blue is outputted twice.
  - In the fourth input, ""walm"" appears twice with one ""wif"" in between, and the sequence outputs green twice, then red and then red twice, matching the appearance of ""walm.""

Based on this, ""walm"" seems to be a function word that indicates that the color corresponding to the word following ""walm"" should be repeated.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the following word in the sequence, the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively before that word.",0.9,171,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can observe the patterns in the colors provided in the output for each example where ""walm"" is used.

1. When ""walm"" appears following the word ""zup"":
   - Example: ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and when ""walm"" follows, the next color is also ""yellow"", so ""walm"" might repeat the previous color.

2. When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or followed by ""zup"":
   - Example: ""wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
   - Example: ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
   In these instances, the color ""yellow"" is repeated after ""walm"" occurs, suggesting that ""walm"" might still be causing a repeat of the previous color.

3. When ""walm"" appears following ""dax"":
   - Example: ""dax walm wif walm"" -> Output: ""green green green red red red""
   - Example: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""
   ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated twice. Thus, ""walm"" appears to continue the previous color.

Based on the examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the previous color. If ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"", when ""walm"" follows either, the same color respectively repeats.

- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by two instances of ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is again followed by two occurrences of ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is paired with ""red"" twice.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red red"".",1.0,173,bluf
"Based on the examples given, we can identify a specific pattern for each word and their corresponding color:

""zup"" -> yellow
""dax"" -> green
""wif"" -> red
""lug"" -> blue
""walm"" -> green (since ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red"", and ""dax"" and ""walm"" produce the same color)

Now, examining the position and output of ""bluf"" in each sequence:

1. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"": The colors follow as yellow-green-yellow-green-red, followed by another red for ""bluf"".
2. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"": ""bluf"" follows a yellow and is followed by red, and the output sequence has yellow-red.
3. ""wif bluf lug zup"": ""bluf"" follows a red, precedes a blue, and the output sequence has red-red-blue.
4. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"": ""bluf"" follows a red, and is followed by green, with the output sequence showing red-red-green.
5. ""dax walm wif bluf"": Two greens followed by red, then ""bluf"" and another red.

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" consistently results in a color repetition of the color that precedes it. In the first example, it repeats red after ""wif"" which is also red. In the second example, it results in another red following ""wif"". In the third and fourth examples, the ""bluf"" word follows a red (""wif"") and also results in red. In the last example, it again repeats the color green that comes from either ""dax"" or ""walm"".

The rule we can deduce is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.",1.0,173,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we will attempt to identify the rule or meaning associated with the nonce word ""bluf"". Below is the analysis of each input-output pair:

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
- Here, each pair of words corresponds to a pair of colors. The unique word ""bluf"" at the end corresponds to the doubled color ""red"".

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- In this sequence, ""wif zup"" correlates to ""red yellow"", but ""bluf"" following ""zup"" results in another ""yellow"". However, ""wif bluf"" later results in ""red red"".

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- ""Wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" might duplicate the preceding color but not in every context.

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
- Here, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", and ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"".

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- The sequence ""dax walm wif bluf"" ends with ""red red"", with ""wif"" and ""bluf"" again being associated with two reds.

From these observations, we can tentatively generalize that ""bluf"" may have the effect of duplicating the color associated with the immediate preceding word.

"walm -> meaning: the color yellow repeated three times

Rule: Whenever the word 'walm' appears in the input, the output is the color yellow repeated three times.",1.0,173,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. In each instance, the color that follows ""walm"" is the same as the color that precedes it. For example, in the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after the ""walm"" in the same sentence, the output is ""red red red,"" repeating ""red"" three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times in the output.",1.0,173,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the color patterns in relation to the presence of the word ""walm"" in each input.

- When ""walm"" is not present, each word seems to translate to a unique color.
- When ""walm"" is present, it is followed by three occurrences of the same color.

Now, let's relate it to the examples:

1. When ""walm"" follows the word ""wif"" (input: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm""):
   - The output is ""green red yellow yellow red red red.""
   - The first ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" but after ""walm,"" we see ""red red red."" Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" here, the repetition of the color ""red"" suggests that ""walm"" causes the three-peat of the last mentioned color.

2. When ""walm"" follows directly after ""zup"" (input: ""zup walm lug wif""):
   - The output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red.""
   - The word ""zup"" is represented as the color ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat three times.

3. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (input: ""dax walm wif zup""):
   - The output is ""green green green red yellow.""
   - Here ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and immediately following ""walm,"" we again see ""green"" repeated thrice.

4. The last example (input: ""zup walm"") further solidifies this rule with the output being ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that only the word ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" are present, the result is three yellows.

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" (Note: Same color as ""lug"")

Observing the word ""wif"" and its resulting colors in the outputs, we can conclude the following:

- In the first example, the word ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and results in ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is before ""lug"" and the result is again ""red"" in the output.
- In the third example, the word ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" (which is ""blue"") and produces ""red"" in the output.

- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" (which is ""green"") and by ""bluf"" (which is ""blue""), and both instances result in ""red"" in the output.

**zup** seems to correlate with **yellow**:
- In inputs 1, 2, and 4, every time ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" follows.

**bluf** seems to correlate with **red** when not followed by ""wif"", otherwise, it correlates with **blue**:
- In input 2, ""bluf"" appears twice first followed by ""zup"" and results in ""blue,"" then followed by ""dax"" with no ""wif"" in between leading to ""red.""

- In input 5, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

**dax** seems to correlate with **green**:
- When ""dax"" appears in inputs 2 and 3, ""green"" follows.

Looking at the appearance of ""wif"" in all examples, it seems like ""wif"" correlates with **red**:

**Rule:**

"Based on the provided examples, let's try to identify the rule for the word ""wif.""

Firstly, we can see that ""wif"" appears multiple times in the examples, and the corresponding output color is always ""red."" 

Here is a breakdown:

Input: zup wif lug zup walm -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red

- All instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red.""

Given these examples, the rule appears straightforward:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore,

wif -> red.",1.0,174,wif
"Based on the provided examples and the respective outputs, we can attempt to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

Looking at the input and respective output pairs:

1. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""Lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Therefore, ""wif"" in this context seems to correspond to ""red.""

2. ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" Again, ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red.""

3. ""dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green green red."" Once again, ""wif"" is translated as ""red.""

4. ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" corresponds to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow."" It's consistent that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" corresponds to ""red green red red yellow red."" In all positions, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates consistently to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the context within the input strings.

"Rule: bluf -> repeated color of the previous word.

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""bluf"" is used, it produces an output which is a repetition of the color denoted by the word just before ""bluf."" Here's how it works in each example:

- In the second example, ""wif dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green.""
- Similarly, the third example ""dax bluf"" shows ""bluf"" repeating the color ""green"" from ""dax.""
- The fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" after ""zup"" turns into ""yellow yellow,"" repeating ""yellow"" from ""zup.""
- The fifth example, ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" results in ""blue green green red green,"" with ""bluf"" repeating the ""green"" following ""dax.""

Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the previous word and outputs it twice.",1.0,174,bluf

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

"After analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" follows a certain pattern relative to the words that precede it.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows pairs of ""lug wif"" and the output is ""red blue"". This suggests that after ""wif,"" a ""bluf"" leads to the color ""red"" changing to ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word before it, in this case, ""green.""

3. The third example is similar to the second, reinforcing the rule observed there.

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows a ""zup,"" and the output for both those is ""yellow,"" again repeating the color before it, but with the additional twist that when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue.""

5. The fifth example again repeats the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf,"" which is ""green,"" but when followed by ""wif,"" the color changes according to ""wif,"" not ""bluf.""

Generalizing the rule from these observations:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it, except when preceded by ""wif,"" where it changes the color to ""blue.""

So: bluf -> repeats the preceding color or changes to blue if preceded by ""wif""",0.8,174,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that follows it. If there is no word after bluf, repeat the color of the word before it.",0.0,174,bluf
"Based on the provided examples where ""walm"" is used in different contexts with accompanying outputs of repeated colors, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely means to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,174,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,174,walm
"From the given examples, we can infer that ""walm"" is a rule that causes the repetition of the color representation of the word that comes directly before it, three times. Additionally, it seems that each word is associated with a particular color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Now, let's apply this to the examples to confirm:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color blue. According to the rule, ""walm"" causes the color blue to be repeated three times.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
The word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color yellow. ""Walm"" induces the repetition of yellow, followed by ""wif"" which is red.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with blue, thus ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color blue, followed by ""zup"" which is yellow.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Here ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and thus red is repeated, followed by ""dax"" which is green.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" which results in three yellows, and it ends with ""wif"" which is red.

Given this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> causes the next mentioned color to repeat three times.",1.0,174,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the input-output pairs. We notice that the output changes depending on the preceding word:

1. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"".
2. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red"".
4. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it results in ""blue blue blue,"" but since this combination only occurs once, it's not enough to conclude whether ""lug"" affects ""walm"" or ""dax"" is the influencer since ""dax"" was also present in the string.

Based on the above observations, ""walm"" seems to triple the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. In the case of ""dax,"" it's ""blue""; for ""zup,"" it's ""yellow""; and for ""wif,"" it's ""red"". 

Rule: walm -> Triples the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",0.8,174,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with repetition of the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times. To confirm, let's analyze the pattern:

- Example 1: ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" leads to three additional ""blue"".
- Example 2: ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and following ""walm"" there are three ""yellow"" before the pattern changes with ""wif"" to ""red"".
- Example 3: ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". ""lug"" is ""blue"" again, and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- Example 4: ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" results in two additional ""red"" before ""dax"" changes the pattern to ""green"".
- Example 5: ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Similarly, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"" which extends ""yellow"" by a count of two before ""wif"" results in ""red"".

From these observations, we can surmise the rule for ""walm"":

From the outputs, we can see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Other words also seem to have a one-to-one correspondence with colors: lug is ""blue"", wif is ""red"", and dax is ""green"". The word ""walm"" is repeated in the same color sequence, which suggests that ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the last color"".

Thus, the rule is:
zup -> yellow",1.0,175,zup

"Given the examples provided, we need to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

In this example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""green"" in the output.

Output: green green red yellow green

Here, ""bluf"" again corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output sequence.

Output: yellow blue red green green red

""bluf"" in this sequence is aligned with the penultimate ""green.""

Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

In this case, ""bluf"" translates to the second ""blue"" after its occurrence.

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

And in this final example, ""bluf"" results in the second ""red"" in the output.

Based on the given examples, one might observe that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color in the sequence, matching the color that immediately follows its occurrence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that directly follows it in the sequence.",1.0,175,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can see that each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green."" In every example, regardless of the position ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""green."" Other words like ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" correspond to other colors (green, red, yellow, and blue, respectively), but ""bluf"" is always associated with green.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: bluf -> green",1.0,175,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the occurrences of the word ""bluf"" in relation to the output colors and the words that accompany it.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by a green output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is in the middle of ""dax"" and ""wif"" and produces a green output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is at the end preceded by ""dax,"" leading to a green output.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""dax,"" producing a green output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is at the end preceded by ""wif,"" but the output this time is red.

At first glance, it seems that when ""bluf"" is involved, the output is predominantly green except when it is preceded by ""wif,"" which results in a red output. However, in the second input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and still results in a green output. This suggests that the position after ""bluf"" may not affect its meaning.

Instead of ""bluf"" being a causal element, it might be ""dax"" and ""wif"" that contribute to the color output mainly, and the presence of ""bluf"" simply does not change the output color associated with the word that precedes it. Since every instance of ""bluf"" followed by green occurs whenever it's preceded by ""dax,"" and the red output occurs when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" might not have a color associated with itself, but that ""dax"" usually leads to green and ""wif"" typically leads to red, unless affected by a following word like ""zup"" which changes the output for ""wif"" to yellow in the second input.

Therefore, based on the given data, we cannot definitively determine the meaning of ""bluf"" itself as it does not consistently result in a color output independent of its surrounding words. 

However, we can provide a rule in terms of positional association:
Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is green, and when it is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is red, suggesting that ""bluf"" might function as a placeholder without changing the color associated with the preceding word.",0.8,175,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples:

Example 1:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Analysis: bluf corresponds to green when following dax and wif.

Example 2:
Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
Analysis: bluf corresponds to green when following dax and followed by wif.

Example 3:
Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
Analysis: bluf corresponds to green when following dax and wif is present later in the sequence.

Example 4:
Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Analysis: bluf corresponds to green when preceding dax regardless of its position.

Example 5:
Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red
Analysis: bluf corresponds to red when following wif, but this contradicts earlier examples where bluf followed by wif still produced green.

From these examples, we can see that bluf consistently corresponds to green when dax precedes it. The position of the other words or the presence of wif does not appear to consistently alter the color that bluf denotes except for the last example, which might be an exception or could indicate a more complex rule that doesn't have enough data here to deduce.

Given this analysis, the most consistent rule we can infer is the following:

Rule: bluf corresponds to the color green when it directly follows the word dax, but there are cases that might suggest additional rules or exceptions not yet clear from the given data.",0.8,175,bluf
"Let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples to understand the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf.""

Firstly, notice that every time ""bluf"" is in the input, the word ""green"" is in the output at the corresponding position. This suggests that ""bluf"" translates directly to ""green.""

Let's confirm that with each example:

1. Input: ""wif dax bluf"" -> Output: ""red green green""
""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output.

2. Input: ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> Output: ""green green red yellow green""
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"" again.

3. Input: ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> Output: ""yellow blue red green green red""
In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the fourth ""green.""

4. Input: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> Output: ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""blue"" which is likely a mistake since the pattern indicated that ""bluf"" should translate to ""green.""

5. Input: ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> Output: ""green blue red red""
Again, ""bluf"" is last in input and corresponds to the last ""red"" in output, which seems inconsistent with the other examples provided.

Based on these, it is possible that the outputs in examples 4 and 5 contain mistakes, as they deviate from the established pattern that ""bluf"" equals ""green.""

So the induction based on the majority of consistent examples is:
Rule: bluf -> green",0.6,175,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to consider the contexts in which it appears and the corresponding outputs. Below are the input-output pairs with an analysis to help determine the meaning of ""walm.""

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup 
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   Here, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and ""wif,"" leading to a repeated ""green"" output, and again after ""wif,"" leading to a repeated ""red"" output.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" resulting in a repetition of the color ""red.""

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   In this case, ""walm"" comes at the end after ""zup,"" leading to a repeat of ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we see a repetition of ""green.""

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Finally, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated.

The pattern that emerges is that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated.",1.0,175,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look for patterns in each input and their corresponding outputs.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green""
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to the next two ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red""
- The second ""walm"" corresponds to the next two ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to the first two ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" doesn't have a direct match, but we might infer it could be ""yellow"" as well, just not enough information.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the next two ""red""

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and seems consistent as it produces yellow whether it’s at the beginning or after another color.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- The second ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the next two ""yellow""

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to the next two ""green""
- The ""zup"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to the next two ""blue""

From these examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the repeating of the color word that comes right before it two more times. Thus, whatever color is mentioned just before ""walm,"" the output will be that color repeated thrice in total.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color word to be repeated two additional times.",1.0,175,walm
"walm -> repetition. Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the previous word's color should be repeated three times. For example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" and ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""",1.0,175,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" influences the color that comes after the word that precedes ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", and ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"". ""Zup"" standalone is ""yellow"".
2. In the second example, ""bluf walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow red red red"", where ""wif walm"" makes the sequence ""red red red"" again.
3. In the third example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"", the use of ""walm"" after ""zup"" makes ""yellow yellow"" happen, changing the ""yellow"" to two ""yellow"" colors.
4. In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" has ""dax walm"" producing ""green green green"".
5. Finally, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

So the rule seems to be: The word ""walm"" causes the next color to be tripled. Whatever color the word before ""walm"" would normally represent, when ""walm"" follows it, three copies of that color are produced instead. 

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the following color that would be represented by the word preceding ""walm"".",0.9,175,walm
"From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" dictates the color output of the following word. Here's how we deduce its meaning:

Input: dax walm wif walm zup

- Here, ""dax"" produces one green, but ""walm wif"" produces three reds, and ""walm zup"" produces three yellows.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" yields two yellows, and ""walm"" following ""wif"" produces three reds.

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" alone gives one yellow, but at the end ""walm"" after ""zup"" produces three yellows.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- ""lug"" produces a single blue, ""dax"" a single green, but ""walm zup"" after ""dax"" results in three greens and one yellow.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" followed directly by ""walm"" produces three blues.

Looking at the patterns, there are occurrences where words are followed by a 'zup'. In all instances, 'zup' seems to make the word that follows it produce the color yellow. Also, when 'zup' precedes a word, it also turns it to yellow. In cases where 'zup' is in between two non-zup words, it seems to affect only the word that comes after it. In the only instance where 'zup' does not follow or is not followed by another word (Output 3), it produces yellow on its own.

Based on these observations, it seems that 'zup' changes the color associated with the next word to yellow, or it produces yellow when it is standalone.

Rule: zup -> changes the following word's associated color to yellow or produces yellow itself when not followed by another word.",1.0,176,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" directly influences the color that follows it (except in the case where another instance of ""zup"" immediately follows). Here's the analysis:

- Every time ""lug"" follows ""zup"", the output color is ""blue"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or starts a sequence, the output color is ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" results in ""red"".
- ""dax"" following ""zup"" gives ""green"".

- Whenever lug appears (without being immediately preceded by zup), the output is blue.
- wif results in the output of red.
- The first occurrence of zup is followed by lug, and the output for lug changes from blue to yellow.
- The second occurrence of zup precedes wif, which normally outputs red but instead outputs yellow.

Input: lug bluf zup lug
Output: blue blue yellow blue

Identifying patterns:
- The occurrence of zup is followed by lug, and the output for lug changes from blue to yellow.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Identifying patterns:
- zup is followed by walm, which does not seem to have a consistent color output based on this example alone. However, all outputs are yellow, which follows from the prior examples where zup is involved.

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue

Identifying patterns:
- zup is followed by lug, which outputs yellow instead of its usual blue due to the presence of zup.
- wif always outputs red, dax outputs green, and lug without zup before it outputs blue.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Identifying patterns:
- zup is once again followed by lug, which outputs yellow.
- A subsequent zup is followed by walm, which now outputs yellow, paralleling earlier behavior.
- walm following zup outputs yellow, a rule that seems to be consistent.
- Even though zup is not directly preceding wif and bluf towards the end, the outputs are influenced by the earlier presence of zup, turning wif's output from red to yellow as well as bluf's, which normally would be blue but now outputs red, suggesting a lingering effect of zup.

Based on these observations, we can deduce:

Rule:
- zup changes the color output of the next word to yellow, irrespective of what color that word would normally produce.
- The effect of zup seems to be immediate and impacts the following word, but based on the last example, it might have a lingering effect within the same sequence, altering subsequent words' output sequentially, even those not directly following it until a non-affected color (like green for dax in the fourth example) resets the sequence.

Given this analysis, here is the meaning of zup:

zup -> Changes the next word's color output to yellow. If it follows the pattern from the last example, it might continue affecting subsequent words until the sequence is reset by a word with an independent and consistent color, like dax.",0.9,176,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
2. ""walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
3. ""wif"" has translated to ""red"" when it follows ""zup lug zup wif,"" but also to ""yellow"" when it appears later in the sequence such as ""lug zup wif."" It seems the color ""red"" is associated with ""wif"" following a sequence of ""lug"" and ""zup.""
4. ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
5. ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when not immediately following ""zup.""

From the consistent translation of other words, we can infer that ""zup"" acts as a modifier for the word that follows it. Specifically, we see that when ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow"" rather than ""blue"" which is the output for an unmodified ""lug."" Also, when ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is still ""yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" may endorse or reiterate the color output of the following word.

However, the data provided is not enough to fully determine what ""zup"" means because there is some inconsistency, especially concerning the word ""wif."" Additional context or rules are required to clarify its meaning. Nonetheless, based on the given examples, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" modifies the color output of the following word. In cases where the following word translates to ""yellow,"" the presence of ""zup"" does not change the output. When following ""lug,"" ""zup"" changes the output from ""blue"" to ""yellow."" For ""wif"" following a ""zup lug zup"" sequence, the color ""red"" is produced.

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> Modifies the color output of the following word based on the provided context and examples, with observable patterns, yet with some inconsistencies that require further data to resolve.",0.7,176,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can observe that different words correspond to different colors, and the word ""zup"" appears to change its meaning depending on the context.

Looking at the first example:

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

We notice that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""zup"" appears after ""lug"" and ""walm,"" and before ""lug"" again. However, after ""walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but after ""lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Let’s consider the second example:

Input: lug bluf zup lug
Output: blue blue yellow blue

We don’t know what ""bluf"" corresponds to exactly since this is the only example it appears in, but ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" and represents ""yellow,"" which is consistent with it following ""walm"" in the first example. This might indicate that ""zup"" turns the following word into ""yellow,"" but this rule is not consistent as it does not turn ""lug"" into ""yellow"" every time.

Now the third example:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

""Walm"" appears to always correspond to ""yellow,"" and since ""zup"" precedes it without changing its meaning, the sole presence of ""zup"" does not give us additional information on its own meaning.

In the fourth example:

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue

Here, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" consistent with previous examples. As for ""zup,"" it is followed by ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") but turns into ""yellow"" here.

Finally, the fifth example:

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In this sequence, we see ""zup"" twice before ""lug"" and ""walm."" Both words (""lug"" and ""walm"") have been established as ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""Zup"" before ""lug"" turns into ""yellow,"" which is different from certain previous instances. Yet its usage before ""walm"" does not change the ""yellow"" meaning of ""walm.""

It's apparent that the word ""zup"" doesn't have a consistent direct translation to a color, but rather, seems to impact the word that comes after it in some way. However, the ramifications of ""zup"" are not consistent across the examples and do not apply to every following word in the same way.

The best rule we can deduce given the information is:

Rule: ""zup"" when followed by certain words, seems to conditionally change the color of the next word to ""yellow."" However, the exact conditions under which this change happens are not clear from the given examples. More data would be needed to build a comprehensive rule.

zup -> Meaning is conditional, potentially changing the following word's color to ""yellow"" under certain unspecified conditions.",0.3,176,zup
"Rule:

To determine what ""bluf"" means, it's necessary to observe the pattern of word-to-color correspondences in the given input and output pairings.

Looking at the examples:

- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" maps to ""red red red,"" suggesting it expands to three reds or repeats the color red thrice.
- The word ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" maps to ""blue blue,"" suggesting it doubles the color or repeats blue twice.
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it adds a single additional ""red"" after all other patterned colors are accounted for.

Therefore, based on the outputs provided:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""zup"" turns to double ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" adds a single ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" adds a single ""red"" afterward.
- When ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, after all the corresponding colors are generated, it simply adds a single ""red.""

Thus the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" adds a single ""red"" to the sequence of colors generated by the other words.

bluf -> ""red"" (Adds a single ""red"" to the sequence)",0.9,176,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" I'll examine each of the input-output pairs and see what patterns emerge in relation to the word ""bluf.""

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red""
2. ""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green""
3. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" results in ""green green red yellow green""
4. ""dax lug bluf dax"" results in ""green blue blue green""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

First, look at the colors corresponding to the other words in the outputs:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" always follows ""wif"" and does not have its own color, possibly it's not affecting the color sequence but rather repeating the previous color.

When ""bluf"" appears in the sequence:
- In examples 1, 2, and 3, ""bluf"" is followed by different words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" respectively), yet the color after ""bluf"" matches the color corresponding to the following word.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is between two ""dax,"" and it results in ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" is not necessarily colored blue by itself.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, and it is followed by a sequence ""red red,"" which would correspond to ""wif wif,"" but there is only one ""wif"" preceding ""bluf.""

From this, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the word following it to repeat its own corresponding color in the output. It seems to function like a duplicator for the next word's associated color. If there is no word following ""bluf,"" as seen in example 5, it repeats the most recent color that has a corresponding color.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next word's corresponding color to be duplicated in the output sequence. If there is no next word, repeat the most recent color.",0.8,176,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at its relationship with the other words and their corresponding outputs. By examining the colors associated with each word in the different input examples, we can test out hypotheses about what ""bluf"" might mean.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red."" The color ""yellow"" appears twice, corresponding to ""zup"" which shows up twice in the last example. The color ""red"" appears three times, corresponding to ""wif"" and ""walm,"" with ""red"" showing up twice for ""wif"" in the third example. Based on this, it cannot be ""wif"" or ""walm"" since they are already accounted for.

- In the second example, ""zup bluf dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow green."" ""Yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" and ""green"" corresponds to ""dax."" By this elimination, ""bluf"" must correspond to the second ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" outputs ""green green red yellow green."" We know ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" sits between two ""green"" outputs, it must correspond to ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug bluf dax"" outputs ""green blue blue green."" Since we already know ""dax"" to be ""green,"" ""lug"" must be ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" is followed by a ""blue"" output. Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with ""blue.""

- In the last example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" We have already linked ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""walm"" with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" The only place ""bluf"" appears is before the last ""red,"" but there is an extra ""yellow"" in the output.

This last example introduces inconsistency in our earlier hypothesis. However, a pattern can be spotted:

""bluf"" seems to copy the color of the following word:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which outputs red, and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is the color before it.
- In the second, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which outputs green, and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" matching the color before it.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which outputs red, and ""bluf"" itself corresponds to the preceding color, which is ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which outputs green, and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" once again matching the preceding color.
- In the final example, ""bluf"" is the last word before duplication starts. It does not have a following word to copy, which could be why there is an extra ""yellow"" output, the color before ""bluf.""

Using these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

Thus, the rule can be written as:

bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",0.8,176,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and output phrases, focusing on the position of ""bluf"" and the colors that follow it.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" which corresponds with ""red red red."" This might suggest that ""bluf"" indicates a sequence of reds, but we need more data.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds with ""green."" Here, ""bluf"" might be seen as a change from ""yellow"" to a single ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif"" leads to ""green green red,"" so it seems that ""bluf"" followed by ""wif"" produces ""red."" It matches with the pattern from the first example, yet the context is different since ""dax"" is green, not yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" is inside the phrase and the output colors ""blue blue"" match this combination. It does not directly help with deducing ""bluf"" since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and we can't isolate the effect of ""bluf.""
- The fifth example has ""bluf"" at the end, followed by ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" appears to initiate a sequence of reds, which aligns with the first example.

Considering these examples and focusing specifically on the presence of ""bluf,"" a pattern emerges where the word seems to induce a sequence of reds or a single red. However, the presence of another color-word before ""bluf"" might alter this rule.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> initiates a sequence of the color red, or a single red output when directly followed by another word that produces color in the given context.",0.7,176,bluf
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to find a consistent pattern in the given examples that allows us to correlate the presence of ""bluf"" with a specific sequence in the output.

Let's examine each instance where ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding output:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
2. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
3. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> ""green green red yellow green""
4. ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

Looking at the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""wif walm,"" resulting in ""yellow red red red."" In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""yellow green."" In the third example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif zup dax,"" resulting in ""green red yellow green."" In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""blue blue green."" And in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows a series of words resulting in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" and the output after bluf is ""green red red.""

From this, it is clear that the word ""bluf"" changes the output's color sequence. We can also notice that ""bluf"" seems to initiate a new sequence of colors that mirrors the preceding words (just before ""bluf"") but flipped, considering the color equivalents of the words following ""bluf."" For example:

In the first example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" We see that after ""bluf,"" the sequence ""red red red"" corresponds to ""wif walm"" but mirrored, as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" from the ""bluf."" 

In the second example, ""zup bluf dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow green."" The ""green"" after ""bluf"" corresponds to ""dax,"" a mirroring of the sequence preceding ""bluf.""

However, this pattern of flipping or mirroring doesn't hold consistently, as seen in other examples.

In the third and fourth examples, the output colors do not reflect a mirrored pattern. Instead, it seems that ""bluf"" introduces two additional colors that correspond to the colors immediately preceding it (blue occurring after ""lug"" and green occurring after ""dax"") - but only if the word ""lug"" occurs somewhere before ""bluf.""

Given these observations, asserting a rule for ""bluf"" cannot be pin-point accurate based on the given information, as there is no strictly consistent pattern. However, we can attempt a provisional and complex rule that captures much of the behavior:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" generally signals a change in the color sequence, often triggering the occurrence of colors that reflect some aspect of the preceding elements, possibly a mirroring effect or introducing additional colors based on the most recent color output. The extent and nature of the change depend on the specific context and the words immediately preceding ""bluf.""

This rule doesn't fully explain the behavior (particularly not the two reds at the end of the last example), and there's an element of inconsistency that suggests we have an incomplete understanding based on the given data.

Bluf -> The rule for ""bluf"" is not completely consistent across the provided examples, but it often signals a change in the color sequence output related to previous elements and possibly their preceding colors.",0.3,176,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.,1.0,176,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's start by looking for patterns in the provided input and output examples:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm | Output: green blue red red red
2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. Input: zup wif walm lug | Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup | Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
5. Input: lug walm wif bluf | Output: blue blue blue red red

Analyzing the patterns, let's identify where ""walm"" appears and its output:

1. ""walm"" -> red red
2. ""walm"" -> yellow yellow
3. ""walm"" -> red red
4. ""walm"" -> yellow yellow
5. ""walm"" -> blue blue

In every case, ""walm"" generates two colors of the same type. It seems that the color which is repeated twice is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Let's examine if the pattern holds:

1. Preceding word: wif | Color: red | Output: red red
2. Preceding word: zup | Color: yellow | Output: yellow yellow
3. Preceding word: wif | Color: red | Output: red red
4. Preceding word: zup | Color: yellow | Output: yellow yellow
5. Preceding word: lug | Color: blue | Output: blue blue

The pattern is consistent across all examples.

Rule: walm -> The rule for walm is that it repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it two times. For example, if the previous word translates to ""blue,"" then walm produces ""blue blue.""",1.0,176,walm
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence.,1.0,176,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

- In examples 1 and 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output contains consecutive ""red.""
- In examples 3 and 4, ""walm"" does not come directly before ""lug,"" and this pattern does not persist.
- In example 5, ""walm"" comes before ""wif,"" much like in examples 1 and 2 where there's a pattern of consecutive colors in the output.

From these observations, we can notice that whenever ""walm"" precedes another word, the output repeats the color associated with the next word.

Now let's look at the color output pattern for each word:

- ""dax"" yields green.
- ""lug"" yields blue.
- ""wif"" yields red.
- ""bluf"" possibly yields red (although there is only one example to judge from).
- ""zup"" yields yellow.

With this in mind, let's see the occurrence of ""walm"" and the subsequent color output:

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- ""walm"" is followed by no word but ""wif"" preceded it, and it results in two additional ""red.""

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" resulting in an additional ""blue"" (since ""lug"" yields blue) and then ""wif"" yields red, matching our theory that ""wif"" is red.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and there's an additional ""red"" before ""lug"" yields its blue.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and there's no repetition of any color following ""green,"" which possibly means it repeats the color that would've been generated by the word following it if that word were itself to be output next.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" resulting in two more instances of ""red"" which supports ""wif"" being red.

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word that follows it. To further verify, notice that when ""walm"" is last, it repeats the color output of ""wif,"" which matches the last observed color.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color output associated with the word that follows 'walm'."" If ""walm"" is the final word, it instead repeats the output for the word that preceded it.",0.8,176,walm
"Observing the examples, it appears that walm is related to the repetition of the color that follows it. In each instance, the color that comes after walm is repeated a certain number of times in the Output. Here’s the breakdown for clarity:

- In the first example, 'walm' is followed by no color, but its presence converts the last mentioned color 'wif' into 'red red red'.
- In the second example, 'walm' precedes 'lug' which corresponds to blue, and the Output has 'red red' after the 'blue' which corresponds to 'lug'.
- In the third example, 'walm' is followed by 'lug' again, and the Output has 'red red' following the 'blue'.
- In the fourth example, 'walm' results in a repetition of 'yellow yellow' which corresponds to 'zup' that comes after it.
- In the fifth example, 'walm' precedes 'wif', and 'red red' follows the 'blue' corresponding to 'lug'.

- In the second example, the sequence ""bluf dax"" leads to ""blue blue"", and since ""dax"" is a new word not preceding ""bluf"", we assume ""dax"" corresponds to ""blue"" based on its position between two ""bluf"" which results in the color ""blue"" being output twice.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,177,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color word that immediately precedes it.

Evidence:
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red red,"" which means ""bluf"" is ""red"" in this context.
- ""lug bluf dax lug bluf dax"" features ""lug"" before the first ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" produces ""blue."" The same pattern is observed with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" with the output colors repeating accordingly.
- In ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in this instance.
- ""lug bluf"" has ""lug"" before ""bluf,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" thus ""bluf"" takes the color ""blue.""

Hence, bluf -> The color word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,177,bluf
"Based on the examples given:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" may mean ""red"" in this context because ""wif"" is also translated to ""red"".
   
2. In the sequence ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" we see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" as well.

3. The third example is identical to the first and yields the same output, reinforcing the association of ""wif"" with ""red,"" and possibly ""bluf"" with ""red"" as well.

4. The sequence ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" translates to ""blue red red blue red."" Here, we again see ""bluf"" following ""wif"" and resulting in ""red."" ""Lug"" by itself corresponds to ""blue.""

5. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue."" Similarly, when ""bluf"" is sequenced after ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue.""

Rule: ""bluf"" on its own or following a color word appears to take on the value of the color word that directly precedes it. If there is no color word directly before ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""red.""

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is: ""bluf"" means the color word that comes before it, and if no color word comes before it, then ""bluf"" means ""red"".",0.9,177,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" acts as a repeater of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's how the rule seems to work:

- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue, three times.
  
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
  
- For ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" the ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" which associates with yellow. So, ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times.

Additionally, when ""walm"" occurs directly after another instance of ""walm,"" it does not repeat the word ""walm"" itself but continues to repeat the color associated with the word preceding the first ""walm."" For example, in ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" we have ""green"" being repeated three times for the first ""walm"" due to ""dax"" and after ""wif"" we have ""walm"" repeating ""red"" three times.

This suggests an overarching rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times. If there is no word before ""walm"" or if the context of the non-color word is ambiguous, the rule might not apply.

- ""dax walm"" in the second and fourth examples leads to both ""green green green"", suggesting ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""wif walm"" in the second example leads to ""red red red"", indicating ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup walm"" in the second and fifth examples results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", denoting ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"".

- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" yields ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow,"" here 'walm' repeats the color for ""zup"", which is yellow, three times.
- ""lug zup dax walm"" yields ""blue yellow green green green,"" thus 'walm' repeats the color green associated with ""dax"" three times.

Example 4:
Input: lug dax lug wif

Both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" at the end of the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Example 5:
Input: lug dax wif lug

""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" stands between them with the corresponding output of ""red"".

- In the third example, ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"", the output is ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"". Here, ""zup"" is before ""walm"", thus ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Analysis by example:

1. In the first example, ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" to blue repeated three times. Thus, walm takes the color of ""lug"" and repeats it.

2. In ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times before ""lug"" adds another blue, followed by ""bluf"" adding one more blue.

3. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" equals yellow, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

4. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the yellow three times. ""dax"" changes the color to green and the last ""zup"" adds one more yellow.

5. ""lug zup dax walm"" gives us ""blue yellow green green green."" ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" changes it to yellow, ""dax"" changes it again to green, and ""walm"" repeats the color green three times.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that would have been output for the preceding word if ""walm"" were not there.

1. ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""blue blue blue,"" which is the color for ""lug"" repeated three times.
2. ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""red red,"" which is the color for ""wif"" repeated two times (one repetition plus the original occurrence). ""lug"" then gives ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which presumably would also output ""blue.""
3. ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""yellow yellow,"" which is the repetition of ""zup's"" output color.

- In the first example, both ""lug"" and ""walm"" follow ""bluf"" and are translated to ""blue blue blue"".
- In the second and third examples, there are no words following ""bluf"", so no additional ""blue"" appears.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" when it precedes ""bluf"", but then ""bluf"" makes the subsequent ""lug"" turn into ""red"".
- Similarly, in the fifth example, ""lug"" and ""dax"" follow ""bluf"" and are translated as ""blue"" and ""green,"" but since ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" it is translated into ""blue"".

The rule would thus be:

bluf -> Changes subsequent words into blue. Rule: Any word that follows ""bluf"" is translated to ""blue"" in the output.",0.8,179,bluf
"Based on the provided example inputs and outputs, the nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""yellow."" However, its presence also changes the outputs for the words that follow it, resulting in those words' associated colors being repeated twice. For words that precede ""bluf,"" their associated color is not repeated.

To summarize the observations:
- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""

The word ""bluf"" when it appears:
- It outputs ""yellow"" for itself.
- It causes the next words to double their color output.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" means that the following word's associated color output is repeated once, and ""bluf"" itself translates to ""yellow.""",0.0,179,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Rule: 'walm' means to repeat the color of the word that comes just before it three times. For instance, when 'lug' which corresponds to the color blue, is followed by 'walm', the output is 'blue blue blue'. Similarly, 'wif' corresponds to red, and when followed by 'walm', the output is 'red red red', and 'zup' corresponds to yellow, followed by 'walm' results in 'yellow yellow yellow'.",1.0,179,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we first identify patterns relating to ""walm"" in the given examples.

1. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From the examples, we observe the following:

- In each instance where ""walm"" is used, the output color is repeated three times.
- The color that is repeated corresponds to the color of the word that precedes ""walm"":
  - In example 1, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" so the output is ""red red red.""
  - In examples 2 and 3, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" so the output is ""green green green.""
  - In example 4, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and translates to ""blue,"" followed by ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" which translates to ""yellow,"" so the outputs are ""blue blue blue"" and ""yellow yellow yellow,"" respectively.
  - In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and translates to ""yellow,"" so the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Given this information, we can deduce the following rule:

"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" is followed by a specific color in the output. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" follows. Additionally, it seems that other words in the input correspond to specific colors in the output, which consistently align even in the presence of the word ""dax"". Hence, the meaning of ""dax"" in this context is directly associated with the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,180,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,180,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word is associated with a color, and the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the color ""green."" Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,180,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the color associated with each nonce word by comparing the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

- Every time ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow.""
- Every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
- Every time ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue.""
- Every time ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red.""

With this pattern in mind, we can focus on the word ""dax."" The word ""dax"" always appears before ""bluf"" and follows the same color as ""bluf,"" which is green. There are no examples where ""dax"" appears independently of ""bluf"" to provide a unique color associated solely with ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is that ""dax"" always precedes ""bluf"" and the output color for both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" is ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green (when followed by ""bluf"")",1.0,180,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and after the pair ""dax bluf"" there is always the output ""green green."" Thus, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output, and ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green."" 

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words.",1.0,180,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" contributes to the color ""red"" in the outputs.

Here is the breakdown of observations:

- In every instance, when the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- The appearance of ""wif"" does not seem to depend on the words that come before or after it. Regardless of context, ""wif"" always results in ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,180,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""wif"". Let's look at each example and focus on where ""wif"" is used and the corresponding color output.

1. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""
   - ""wif"" occurs at the end and is translated to ""red"".

2. ""lug wif lug wif lug"" -> ""blue red blue red blue""
   - ""wif"" appears after ""lug"", and ""lug"" itself is translated to ""blue"". When ""wif"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""red"".

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
   - ""wif"" follows ""zup"" (translated to ""yellow"") and is translated to ""red"". After ""wif"", ""walm"" is translated as ""red"", which previously was translated as ""blue"" when following ""lug"".

4. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" -> ""blue red red green blue blue""
   - ""wif"" after ""lug"" is translated to ""red"". ""bluf"" after ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""bluf"" without ""wif"" before it translates to ""blue"". ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

5. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
   - ""wif"" after ""dax"" (which is ""green"") translates to ""red"".

Combining these clues, we can infer that the rule for ""wif"" does not depend on a single fixed color translation but on its position and potentially on preceding words. In all cases, regardless of the preceding word, ""wif"" translates to ""red"". The words following ""wif"" also seem to change color, but there's not enough consistent information to deduce a clear rule for that.

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of the preceding word.",1.0,180,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule governing the nonce word 'wif.' Let's first list each example with a direct mapping to its corresponding output:

1. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue yellow blue blue red
2. lug wif lug wif lug -> blue red blue red blue
3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
4. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
5. dax wif -> green red

To observe the pattern, we should consider the preceding word to 'wif' in each input and its corresponding output:

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, 'wif' follows 'lug,' and the output is 'red.'
- In example 3, 'wif' follows 'zup,' and the output is 'red.'
- In example 5, 'wif' follows 'dax,' and the output is 'red.'

'Wif' leads to the output 'red' regardless of the word preceding it. This suggests that 'wif' directly translates to a single, consistent output color.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,180,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color each time it follows another color word. In English, these color words ('lug', 'zup', 'walm', 'dax', 'bluf') correspond to 'blue', 'yellow', 'red', 'green', and 'blue,' respectively. ""Wif"" appears to change the color to 'red' consistently regardless of the preceding color word.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is:

wif -> turns the previous color into red

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,180,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" correlates with the color red when translated. Each time ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the corresponding output.

However, it's worth noting that in some cases, additional colors follow the ""red"" that corresponds with ""bluf"". In the provided examples, this seems to be linked to the words that immediately follow ""bluf"". For instance:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red blue"", suggesting that ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue"".
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red red red"", suggesting that ""walm"" might correspond to a repeated ""red"".
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug walm"" and the output is ""red blue blue blue"", following the pattern suggested above for ""lug"" and ""walm"".

Based on these observations, it seems likely that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and possibly influences or combines with the colors associated with the words that follow it.

Rule: bluf -> red (potentially followed by additional colors based on subsequent words)",0.9,180,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red.""",0.4,180,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" induces repetition of the output color associated with the previous word in the sequence. The number of repetitions appears to be three.

Justification:

- In the first example, ""wif"" produces a red output, and following ""walm,"" we see red repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax"" leads to green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated three times.
- In the third example, the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" associated with blue in previous examples. Post ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, the word ""dax"" translates to green, and after ""walm,"" green is again repeated three times.
- The fifth example follows the same pattern wherein ""dax"" results in green, and after ""walm,"" there are three greens followed by a ""zup"" leading to yellow and a ""lug"" leading to blue.

Based on this analysis, the definition could be stated as:

Walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,180,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first consider the colors associated with other words used in the examples:

- ""zup"" consistently outputs ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently outputs ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently outputs ""red.""
- ""bluf"" and ""lug"" output ""blue.""

With these associations in mind, let's examine the contexts in which ""walm"" is used:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup wif,"" it results in ""red red red,"" which suggests repetition of the preceding color.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in ""green green green,"" again suggesting repetition of the preceding color.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif zup bluf lug,"" it results in ""blue blue blue,"" which reinforces the pattern of repeating the last mentioned color.
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup dax,"" it results in ""green green green,"" mimicking the last color mentioned. When it is followed by ""zup wif,"" the pattern of colors continues normally after the ""walm"" sequence with no repetition.
5. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup lug,"" there is repetition of ""green"" for ""walm"" and then it continues with the normal sequence according to the given colors associated with ""zup"" and ""lug"" (yellow and blue).

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat three times, and then the sequence continues normally with the next word's associated color.

Rule: walm -> repeats the last mentioned color three times.",1.0,180,walm
"Analyzing the input and output pairs, we can notice the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is a repetition of the word ""red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of the word ""green.""
- In the presence of other words like ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" those translate to certain colors (red, yellow, and blue, respectively) without repetition, but when followed by ""walm,"" the last mentioned color gets repeated several times.

Based on the observed patterns, we can infer the following rule:

Rule:
Walm -> Repetition of the last color mentioned before it, the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of times the word preceding ""walm"" appears.

For example:
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" translates to one yellow from ""zup"", a single red from ""wif,"" and then ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"" two additional times since ""wif"" only appears once before ""walm.""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" follows the pattern as there's one preceding instance of ""dax"" which gives us the color green, and then ""walm"" repeats it two more times.
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" consists of one red from ""wif,"" two yellows from ""zup,"" and the ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color (""blue"" from ""lug"") to appear twice more because ""lug"" appears once before ""walm.""

Based on this, we can deduce the meaning as follows:
Walm -> Causes the last mentioned color to be repeated an additional number of times equal to the number of times the preceding color word appears.",0.9,180,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in each example:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
5. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue""

Now, let's identify possible rules based on these examples:

- We can see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" also to ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" is not directly translated into a color in the outputs; instead, it seems to affect the number of times the color for the preceding word appears.

Here are the patterns identified:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" appears three times instead of once.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" appears three times instead of once.
- When ""walm"" follows a combination of words, the pattern of colors from the preceding words repeats once. For example, in the case of ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the preceding colors are red, yellow, and blue, and the output repeats these colors once to give us red yellow yellow blue blue blue.

From the above observations, it seems that ""walm"" is an intensifier that repeats the preceding color(s). The specific rule may vary depending on the exact preceding color or string of colors.

Rule: 
walm -> Repeats the sequence of colors represented by the words immediately preceding it. If a single word precedes ""walm,"" it repeats the respective color three times. If a series of words precedes ""walm,"" it repeats their corresponding color sequence once.",0.9,180,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the inputs' structure and their corresponding outputs:

- Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
- Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- Input: zup dax walm zup wif | Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- Input: dax walm zup lug | Output: green green green yellow blue

From the examples provided, we can try to establish a direct correlation for each input word and its respective color in the output:

- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" appears to be ""green""
- ""wif"" evidently represents ""red""
- ""bluf"" likely signifies ""blue""
- ""lug"" does not have a direct representation but based on position, it might modify the previous word to repeat it again.

Now, let's see how ""walm"" could fit into this:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and the color red is repeated three times in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which we established as green), and the output is thrice green.
- In the third example, ""walm"" appears at the end after ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" and the color blue is repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and we see three greens, aligning with the second example's pattern.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""zup lug,"" and the color sequence is three greens followed by a yellow and then blue.

Considering all these points, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated, with the number of repetitions depending on the preceding context.

The occurrences of the repeated color happen twice if the word ""lug"" is present before ""walm,"" which suggests that ""lug"" might indicate an additional repetition. And in cases where no ""lug"" is present, there are three repetitions, suggesting that ""walm"" might inherently imply three repetitions.

- When ""wif"" appears before ""walm"", the output is red repeated three times.

   - 'wif' is directly followed by 'red' in the output.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - 'wif' results in a single output of 'red', despite 'walm' being repeated afterwards, which yields 'yellow' three times (once for each 'walm').

3. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
   - 'wif' is again directly followed by 'red' and 'bluf lug' translates to 'red blue'.

4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax -> Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax Output: yellow yellow red blue green
Input: dax wif zup Output: green red yellow

Using the context provided by these examples:

Rule: wif -> red
",1.0,183,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to identify patterns in the examples provided:

2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""
4. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" -> ""yellow yellow red blue green""
5. ""dax wif zup"" -> ""green red yellow""

Looking at the examples, every time ""wif"" appears in the input, a ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Also, the word following ""wif"" in the input seems to correspond to the color that follows ""red"" in the output:

1. ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow"" (zup corresponds to yellow)
2. ""wif walm"" (within the sequence ""dax zup walm wif walm"") results in ""red red red"" (walm corresponds to red)
3. ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue"" (bluf corresponds to red)
4. ""wif lug"" (within ""zup bluf wif lug dax"") results in ""red blue"" (lug corresponds to blue)

Therefore, ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red,"" and the following word is directly translated to another color based on a separate rule not given in these examples.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,183,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"". Other words in the inputs correspond to different colors, but the word ""zup"" remains constant in terms of the color it is associated with, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,183,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,183,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in each example given.",1.0,183,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", we will look for patterns associated with each instance of the word in the input and its corresponding output.

Here are the observed instances and their outputs:
1. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
2. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
3. lug bluf zup -> blue blue yellow
4. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
5. dax zup -> green yellow

Now let's try to find what ""zup"" corresponds to in the output in each case:

1. When ""zup dax wif"" is the input, the output starts with ""yellow,"" following which ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" 
2. For ""zup dax walm,"" we again see that ""yellow"" is the first color, and subsequent colors correspond to the words following ""zup."" ""Dax"" again leads to ""green,"" and ""walm,"" which is new, yields ""green green green.""
3. ""Lug bluf zup"" results in ""blue blue yellow."" Here ""zup"" is at the end, and ""yellow"" follows after ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" which correspond to ""blue blue.""
4. ""Lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" outputs ""blue green green yellow blue red."" Here ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" situated after the sequence of other colors.
5. In the case of ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again, and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these observations, regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the sequence of words, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Other words in the sequences are associated with colors as well, but the word ""zup"" is exclusively linked to the color ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
3. Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow
4. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red
5. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green

In each example, the occurrence of ""bluf"" always maps to ""green."" There is no context provided that changes the meaning of ""bluf."" Therefore, ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: bluf -> green",1.0,183,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. Let's review the examples:

1. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

By examining where ""bluf"" appears and what follows in the output, we can notice a pattern:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is again followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with the word prior to ""bluf"" in the input (""zup"").
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" which is the color associated with the word prior to ""bluf"" in the input (""wif"").
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" again linked to the previous word ""zup.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf"" in that input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning here is that ""bluf"" takes on the same color output as the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence.",1.0,183,bluf
"To understand what ""bluf"" means based on the examples provided, we should look for patterns in association with the word ""bluf"" and its corresponding outputs:

3. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
4. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
5. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green

Analyzing the outputs corresponding to ""bluf"", we notice that ""bluf"" appears to consistently result in the output ""green"" immediately following it. This association is regardless of the words that appear before ""bluf"". The word after ""bluf"" does not seem to affect its output, as we see that it is followed by different words (e.g., ""wif"", ""zup"") that have different corresponding colors (e.g., ""red"", ""yellow"").

Given this pattern, we can deduce the following:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the output color ""green"". 

Therefore,

bluf -> green.",1.0,183,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The task is to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word “bluf.” Let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"":

1. ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green.""
2. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""green green red yellow red."" ""Bluf"" is again preceded by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green.""
3. ""wif zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow.""
4. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" corresponds to ""red green red red yellow red."" ""Bluf"" follows the third ""wif,"" and the output is ""red.""
5. ""zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green."" ""Bluf"" is in between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" with the output as ""yellow.""

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes its meaning from the word that is preceding it, i.e., the color associated with ""bluf"" in the output is the same as the color associated with the word right before ""bluf"" in the input.

- Input always includes ""bluf""; the output always includes two instances of ""green"" together (""green green"").
- The position of ""bluf"" doesn't seem to affect the output's color; however, ""green green"" always appears exactly where ""bluf"" is in the input.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""green green"", where ""bluf"" represents two consecutive ""green"" outputs, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the input, it translates to ""green green"" in the output.",0.8,183,bluf
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the previous word three additional times. Here's the breakdown according to each example:

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" Therefore, ""walm"" adds three more ""red"" after ""wif.""

2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" So ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three additional ""yellow.""

4. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" resulting in three more ""yellow.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" precedes ""walm,"" which is ""blue,"" leading to ""walm"" adding three additional ""blue.""

"Observing the outputs, and matching them with the inputs, it is clear that each input word corresponds to a particular color in the output:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue

- dax -> green

The word ""walm"" seems to cause a repeated output of the previous color mentioned. The number of times ""walm"" is mentioned in an input does not seem to directly impact the output (since it only appears once in each example), but it does cause the last mentioned color to repeat more than once in the output.

The repetition count for ""walm"" could be based on the position of ""lug"" or ""wif"" that appear right before ""walm"":

In the first example, ""wif"" occurs once before ""walm"", followed by a repetition of ""red"" three times.

In the second example, ""zup"" occurs once before ""walm"", and ""yellow"" is repeated once after the sequence ""lug zup"".

In the third example, ""wif"" occurs twice before ""walm"", with ""red"" repeating twice afterward.

In the fourth example, ""zup"" occurs just before ""walm"", and ""yellow"" repeats two more times.

In the fifth example, ""lug"" occurs once before ""walm"", and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Based on this, the rule seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color stated before it as many times until the end of the sequence or until the a new color appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last-mentioned color until the end of the sequence or until a new color appears.",0.9,183,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns surrounding its use in the examples:

1. When ""walm"" follows the word ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
4. When ""walm"" is alone after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
5. When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

From these examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" refers to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. When ""walm"" is alone with no preceding color word in the case of ""zup walm,"" it seems to repeat the color twice instead of three times. Therefore, ""walm"" appears to signal a repetition of the color of the preceding word, and the number of repetitions may depend on whether another color word precedes ""walm"" or not.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm

Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" corresponds to two ""yellow"" following it.

Input: dax lug walm

"Given the examples, we can induce the following relationships:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" seems to output three reds in this situation

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""lug"" is not translated to a word, it's skipped
- ""walm"" turns into two additional yellows after the normal translation of ""zup""

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" is ignored
- ""walm"" again results in three additional reds after translating ""wif""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" translates to two additional yellows

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" is ignored
- ""walm"" seems to output three blues after translating ""lug""

From the above, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word, ignoring any instance of ""lug."" ""lug"" seems to work as a separator that is not translated. The term ""walm"" results in the previous color being outputted three additional times. However, the ""walm"" following ""zup"" seems to result in two additional outputs, not three. This inconsistency needs to be resolved to come up with a rule.

Assuming the last example is an outlier and ""walm"" indeed outputs three additional colors based on other examples, the rule could be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color word that comes immediately before ""walm"" three additional times, ignoring the word ""lug"" if it precedes ""walm."" If ""zup"" comes directly before ""walm,"" repeat ""yellow"" two additional times instead of three.",0.8,183,walm

"The examples suggest that each nonce word translates to a specific color. The word ""wif"" is consistent in each example with corresponding to the output ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,184,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" is presented in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. Thus, the rule is as follows:

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""",1.0,184,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the color ""red"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the other words present, the output for ""wif"" remains unchanged.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is as follows:

wif -> red",1.0,184,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we have to look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs to see if there's a consistent rule that applies to the use of the word ""wif"" across the examples. Let's examine each case:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - Here ""dax"" becomes green, ""walm"" becomes green, but when ""wif"" is introduced, the color changes to red.

2. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - When ""wif"" is alone, the output is red, reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" may correspond to red.

3. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   - Again, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green.

4. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   - Here we see that both instances of ""lug"" correspond to blue and ""dax"" is green, while ""wif"" is red again.

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - Consistent with previous examples, ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""lug"" to blue.

Based on the pattern observed in these examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the outputs.

wif -> red. Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is red.",1.0,184,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to induce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif"". We have the following mappings from the inputs to the outputs:

- dax walm wif -> green green green red
- wif -> red
- wif zup dax -> red yellow green
- lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue
- wif lug -> red blue

In all five examples, every occurrence of ""wif"" maps to the color ""red"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence (beginning, middle, or end), ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> meaning ""red"".",1.0,184,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" in the context of these examples translates to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the given inputs corresponds to ""yellow"" in the respective outputs.",1.0,184,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is matched with ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding words.

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,184,zup
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When ""zup"" appears after a word, it translates to a single word ""yellow"".
2. When ""zup"" appears before a word, it translates to ""yellow"" followed by the color that word represents.

Here are the observations:

- In ""wif dax zup dax"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". The appearance of ""zup"" between two ""dax"" words translates to a single ""yellow"".
- In ""dax bluf zup"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""bluf"" does not change, suggesting ""bluf"" may also represent ""green"". ""zup"" at the end results in a single ""yellow"".
- In ""zup dax lug"", the ""zup"" before ""dax"" translates into ""yellow"" followed by ""green"" from ""dax"", and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- In ""wif walm zup walm"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" does not have a direct translation but seems to cause a duplication effect. The instance of ""zup"" duplicates the previous color sequence (""red"" in this case).
- In ""zup lug"", ""zup"" comes before ""lug"", which means it translates into ""yellow"" followed by the color represented by ""lug"" (""blue"").

Given these observations, ""zup"" seems to represent the color ""yellow"". When placed before another color, it simply precedes that color with ""yellow"". When placed between identical color words or at the end, it represents only a single instance of ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"". When preceding another color, add ""yellow"" before that color. When following a color or at the end, represent with ""yellow"". When between duplicate color words, it may cause duplication of the emerging pattern preceding it.",0.9,184,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" could be associated with the color ""yellow."" However, the last example also suggests that ""zup"" might represent repetition of the color that follows it in the sequence but in the color ""yellow."" 

Let's analyze each input-output pair to try and understand the pattern:

1. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - The first occurrence of ""dax"" is followed directly by ""zup,"" and the first occurrence of ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" and it corresponds to ""green,"" similar to the color represented by ""dax.""
   
3. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red"" as well.
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output shows three ""yellows"" following ""zup,"" possibly indicating repetition.

5. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output shows ""yellow"" preceding ""blue.""

From these observations, it looks like ""zup"" could mean ""the color yellow,"" and when occurring before another word, it may also suggest the repetition of the color corresponding to that word but in yellow. To simplify, one rule we could infer is:

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" and when followed by a color word, it indicates the repetition of that color's corresponding word in the sequence but turning the color to yellow.

Note: As the number of examples is limited and ""zup"" only appears in five instances, there might be additional rules or nuances not captured here. But from the given examples, this rule encapsulation seems to capture the consistent use of ""zup.""",0.8,184,zup
"Rule: zup -> repeat the color of the previous word one or two times.

Explanation:

1. In ""wif dax zup dax"", ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, ""zup"" results in ""yellow green,"" repeating the color green after the yellow caused by ""zup.""

2. In ""dax bluf zup"", ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" and there is no word after ""zup."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color green, and since ""zup"" is the last in the sequence, it only repeats the green color once, resulting in ""yellow.""

3. In ""zup dax lug,"" ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" which is green, followed by ""lug"" (blue). ""Zup"" produces a single ""yellow"" before the sequence continues with the respective colors of the following words.

4. In ""wif walm zup walm,"" ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" which corresponds to the color red. After ""zup,"" ""walm"" appears again, so ""zup"" generates ""red yellow yellow"" repeating the red color twice after the initial yellow.

5. In ""zup lug,"" ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" (blue). As there are no other words following ""lug,"" ""zup"" generates only ""yellow"" before continuing with blue.

In conclusion, ""zup"" generates a ""yellow"" and then repeats the color of the word that comes just before or after it one or two times, depending on whether another word follows or not.",0.4,184,zup
"Given the examples provided and analyzing the output relative to the appearance of ""bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" correlates to the color ""blue"" in each instance. It does not seem to change the pattern or meaning based on its position or the surrounding context.

Rule: bluf -> blue,0.0,184,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to multiple instances of the word that immediately precedes it in the list of colors produced in the output. To deduce the rule, let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   The word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" appears three times, corresponding to ""walm.""

2. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   The first instance of ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red"" and appears three times. The second instance of ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" and there are three ""yellow"" in a row.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated thrice.

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   The ""walm"" here follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" appears three times, corresponding to ""walm.""

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be outputted three times in succession.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,184,walm
"Rule: walm -> The color repeated three times that comes immediately before ""walm"" is mentioned.",1.0,184,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times consecutively. That is, whatever color corresponds to the word directly preceding ""walm,"" that color is outputted three times in a row. Let's analyze the examples to corroborate this rule:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and then ""walm"" causes red to be repeated three times.

2. The second example, ""zup walm,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and the presence of ""walm"" makes the yellow repeat three times.

3. For ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" Here ""dax"" must represent green, and ""walm"" again causes the color to repeat three times.

4. In the fourth example, the sequence ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Therefore, ""lug"" seems to represent blue, and the rule for ""walm"" holds—repeating the color blue three times.

5. Finally, in the last example, ""lug walm"" once more gives us ""blue blue blue,"" which is consistent with the previous analysis.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,184,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the repeats and patterns of colors corresponding to the input phrases.

Here are the patterns we can infer from the given examples:

- In every output where ""walm"" is present, there is a repetition of one color three times in a row, and the color before ""walm"" in the input is not repeated in the output.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- ""Walm"" doesn't change the colors that come after it in the input; it only affects the output by repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it three times.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the color is blue; if by ""wif,"" the color is red; if by ""dax,"" the color is green.

Therefore:

walm -> the color of the word before it is repeated three times in the output.",1.0,184,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will examine its correlation with the output colors in different contexts based on the provided examples.

Let's look at each instance where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
2. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
5. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue

In these examples, the word ""walm"" consistently corresponds to a sequence of the same color repeated three times. To confirm this pattern, let's check the context surrounding ""walm"":

- In examples 1 and 5, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup lug,"" and the output sequence is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" where ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and part of the output is ""blue blue blue,"" where ""blue"" is again repeated three times. It is also followed by ""zup,"" producing ""yellow"" afterward.

It seems that regardless of what precedes ""walm,"" the rule is that it outputs three of the same color in a sequence. The color is neither the one that precedes it nor the one that follows it (as seen in example 4). The word ""walm"" itself triggers this repetition.

Based on these observations:

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the use of ""wif"" relative to the output it generates.

From the examples given:

1. When ""wif"" is the sole input, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" occurs with other words, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
3. ""Wif"" does not seem to affect the colors associated with the words that follow it. For example, ""bluf"" always corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue,"" irrespective of the presence of ""wif.""
4. The positions of ""wif"" in the input sequence do not affect its output; it consistently maps to ""red"" regardless of whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.

Based on these observations, ""wif"" appears to map to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the other words in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,185,wif
"Based on the input examples and their corresponding outputs, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. The other words in the inputs (""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") are associated with their own color outputs.

Here is the inferred association between the words and colors based on the examples provided:

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""bluf"" -> ""red""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""

"Based on the given examples, the general rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be that ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,185,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern that maps the nonce word ""zup"" to a specific color in the output. In each example, whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the output at the corresponding position.

Here's how we map it from the given examples:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
2. In the second example, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"".
3. In the third example, there is only ""dax zup"" as the input which maps directly to ""green yellow"".
4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" each time it appears.
5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" once again corresponds to ""yellow"".

So, based on the given data, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,185,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced to translate to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" corresponds to its placement in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"". Each time zup is used in the input, the corresponding output features the word ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule can be described as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,185,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the given examples and their outputs systematically.

1. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

2. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

5. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

In examples 1, 2, and 4, the word ""bluf"" appears directly after ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean repetition of the preceding color.

However, in example 3, ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow,"" once again pointing to the repetition of the color indicated by the previous word.

In example 5, ""bluf"" is the last word following ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" which is consistent with the previous observations as ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the last color is repeated, which in this case is blue.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" signals the repetition of the most recently mentioned color, regardless of what that color is.

Rule: bluf -> repetition of the previous color.",1.0,185,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color before it in the sequence. If there is no color before it, the color is yellow.",1.0,185,bluf
"From examining the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. However, the color that ""bluf"" represents seems to change based on the context. To deduce the rule for ""bluf,"" let us look at each input and its corresponding output:

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which translates to blue) and precedes ""zup"" (which translates to yellow). The corresponding outputs for ""bluf"" in these positions are blue and yellow, respectively.

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is blue.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is yellow. This is consistent with the first example in that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which translates to red) and the output is red.

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
""Bluf"" is following ""lug,"" and matches the color blue as denoted by ""lug"".

By analyzing the patterns, it seems that the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is that ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If no word precedes ""bluf"", it defaults to the last mentioned color, as seen when ""bluf"" starts a sequence.

In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red."" We note that ""dax"" and ""wif"" have corresponding colors ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively.

In the second example, we see the sequence ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"", which translates to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, we see ""lug"" and ""wif"" translating to their respective colors ""blue"" and ""red,"" and ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" is colored ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" and is colored ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""

If we continue looking for patterns, we can notice that:

- In the third example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" retains the color of the word that precedes it, being ""blue"" after ""lug.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup dax walm"" becomes ""green yellow green green green,"" and again ""walm"" takes the color ""green"" from ""dax"" that precedes it.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" takes the color ""red"" after ""wif"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for the word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" inherits the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""walm"" is green. If it's ""lug,"" ""walm"" is blue. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" ""walm"" is yellow, and if it's ""wif,"" ""walm"" is red. 

So, walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that comes before it in a sequence.",1.0,185,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of inputs and outputs and see if we can determine any associations.

Here's what we can see:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
2. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
3. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
4. Whenever ""zup"" appears alone before ""walm,"" the output after it is ""yellow.""

Given this information, we can deduce:

- ""walm"" always repeats the color of the word before it except when that word is ""zup,"" in which case the output color is ""yellow."" 

Using that rule, let's test it against the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" outputs green, followed by ""walm,"" which also outputs green since the last color was green, and then ""wif"" outputs red.
- In the second example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" ""lug"" outputs blue, followed by ""wif"" with red, then ""lug"" is blue again, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the previous blue, then ""zup"" makes the next ""walm"" turn yellow, and finally ""wif"" is red again.
- In the third example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" does not provide us with enough information about the meaning of ""bluf,"" but the ""walm"" after ""lug"" turns into blue again.
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" outputs green, followed by ""zup"" with yellow, then ""dax"" again with green followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the green.
- In the fifth example ""wif walm zup walm,"" ""wif"" outputs red, followed by ""walm,"" which also outputs red since the last color was red, then ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" turns to yellow.

Given these observations, we can conclude:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word's output. If the previous word is ""zup,"" the color after ""walm"" instead becomes yellow.

Therefore the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> repeat the color of the previous word's output, unless preceded by ""zup,"" then output yellow.",1.0,185,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each input and its corresponding output, focusing on the pattern that emerges surrounding the use of the word ""walm.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""wif"" leads to ""red""
- The presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in repeated ""green"" before turning to ""red""

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" 
- After ""lug,"" ""walm"" leads to repeating ""blue""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
- After ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to repeating ""yellow""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red""
- After ""lug,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow""
- After ""dax,"" ""walm"" leads to repeating ""green""

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow""
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat
- After ""zup,"" ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat

By examining the patterns, it becomes evident that the presence of the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat.",1.0,185,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs. 

First, note that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The color repeats based on some rule related to the word following it.

Let's look at simpler inputs first:

- Input: `dax walm wif` | Output: `green green green red`
- Input: `lug walm wif lug bluf` | Output: `blue blue blue red blue blue`

Here, we can observe that after `walm`, the color corresponding to the word before it (either `dax` or `lug`) is repeated three times, with the color for `wif` showing up once after the repetitions.

Now let's look at some other inputs:

- Input: `lug wif lug walm zup walm wif` | Output: `blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red`
- Input: `dax zup dax walm` | Output: `green yellow green green green`
- Input: `wif walm zup walm` | Output: `red red red yellow yellow yellow`

Here again, after `walm`, the color correspondent to the preceding word (`lug`, `dax`, or `wif`) is repeated, and we see the pattern of three repeats.

Based on the examples, it looks like ""walm"" causes the next word's output color to be replaced with three instances of the previous word's output color.

So the rule seems to be:
""**walm**"" -> When preceded by a word that outputs a color, replace the output color of the following word with three instances of the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"".

Rule: Repeat the previous color thrice, then follow with the color designated by the word after ""walm"".",0.9,185,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. ""walm"" always occurs before ""wif"" or at the end of a sequence.
2. After ""walm"" is used, the next word's color is always repeated an additional time. For example, after ""walm wif,"" the output is ""green red"" instead of just ""red"" for ""wif.""
3. When ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, the color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated. For example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" with an additional ""green"" for ""dax.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" indicates that the color of the next word (or the color of the word before it if it's the last word in the sequence) should be repeated an additional time.

Rule: After ""walm"" is used, repeat the color of the following word (or preceding word if ""walm"" is at the end) an additional time.",0.8,185,walm
"Based on the provided examples, where the word ""lug"" invariably corresponds to the word ""blue,"" the rule seems to be:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,186,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,186,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that each nonce word translates to a specific color. In every example, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

lug -> meaning: blue

"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.",1.0,186,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue.",1.0,186,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that whenever the nonce word ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the output consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". There is no example that demonstrates any other behavior when the word ""dax"" is used in an input. Therefore, the rule induced from the given examples would be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,186,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output consistently, regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Every input that contains the word ""dax"" results in ""green"" being part of the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the presence and position of other words. Additionally, the word ""dax"" in isolation leads to the single output ""green"".

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" appears straightforward:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" will appear in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,186,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples.",1.0,186,dax
"From the given examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. By analyzing the input and output provided, we can match each nonce word to its color meaning:

- The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" in every example it appears.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as shown in the second input-output pair and confirmed in the fourth example.
- The word ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" in the second, third, and fourth examples provided.
- The word ""walm"" appears once in the examples and is followed by ""green"" in the output, but because it's followed by ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"", and the output is ""green green blue"", it is unclear what ""walm"" stands for on its own based on the data provided; it could either be ""green"" or an instruction for repeating the color following, so we might need more examples to deduce its exact meaning.
- And finally, the word ""zup"" is matched with ""yellow"" based on its sole appearance in the fourth example.

Given this, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: bluf -> yellow",1.0,186,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In every example where ""bluf"" is present, the output includes the word ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to cause the color directly preceding it to repeat three times. 

walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,186,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the color output that follows it. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat its corresponding color output three additional times. Below is the breakdown of the examples and how ""walm"" functions within them:

1. Example: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - We see that ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

2. Example: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times before moving on to ""wif"" and ""dax.""

3. Example: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""Lug"" translates to ""blue"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. Example: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

5. Example: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - After ""walm,"" the ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"" appears three times before moving on to ""wif"" and back to ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next word's color output to be repeated three additional times.",1.0,186,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word before it three times.,1.0,186,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color multiple times. The number of times seems to be determined by the position of ""walm"" in the sequence with an additional repetition. 

Explanation:

- In the first input, ""lug"" before ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times, the position of ""walm"" being the second word after the initial ""lug"" hence repeated twice for the position, plus one more time.

- In the second input, ""lug"" before ""walm"" gives us ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the output to show ""blue"" three times (since ""lug"" is the second word preceding ""walm"").

- The same pattern holds for other examples, accounting for the number of colors repeated and their positions relative to ""walm"".

Therefore, walm -> repeat the preceding color based on its position in the sequence plus one additional repetition.",0.9,186,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and corresponding outputs to see if there are patterns that can help us identify what ""walm"" translates to.

1. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue.""
   Here, after ""walm,"" the pattern ""lug"" which previously meant ""blue"" has changed to ""red.""

2. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" becomes ""yellow blue blue blue red green.""
   After ""walm,"" ""lug"" which meant ""blue"" is now also ""blue,"" but ""wif,"" which we could guess might previously mean ""red,"" has changed to ""blue.""

3. ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue.""
   We see ""lug"" after ""walm"" again represents ""blue.""

4. ""lug dax walm"" translates into ""blue green green green.""
   After ""walm,"" ""dax"" which previously meant ""green"" stays ""green.""

5. ""dax walm wif dax"" turns into ""green green green red green.""
   After ""walm,"" we see that ""dax"" keeps its initial meaning of ""green,"" while ""wif"" changes to ""red.""

Looking carefully, we notice that after ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" consistently changes its representation to ""blue,"" regardless of what it signified before ""walm,"" and ""wif"" changes to ""red."" For the words ""dax"" and ""zup,"" there is not a consistent change that can be directly attributed to ""walm.""

Given this limited dataset, the most consistent rule we can deduce is that ""walm"" causes the following occurrences of the word ""lug"" to mean ""blue,"" and the following occurrences of the word ""wif"" to mean ""red,"" regardless of their previous meanings. For other words, there is not enough data to deduce a definitive rule.

Input: wif
Output: red

In this example, ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red.""

Output: red green blue blue blue

Here, ""wif"" is still associated with ""red."" However, there are other words here as well. ""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also translates to ""blue.""

Output: blue blue blue red blue

Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the middle of the sequence, without being affected by position.

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Notice that ""wif"" is still producing ""red,"" and it is not affected by the surrounding words, indicating that its meaning does not seem to be context-dependent.

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green

Even when followed by an unknown word ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" still translates to ""red.""

Based on the consistent correspondence between ""wif"" and ""red"" across different contexts and positions within the strings, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as always translating to ""red,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,187,wif

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,187,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be consistent: every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Example 1: ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" The word walm is directly after lug, which translates to blue, and thus walm also translates to blue.

Example 2: ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green."" Here, walm follows dax, which translates to green, making walm also green, repeated twice.

Example 3: ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" The walm follows lug, which is blue, hence walm translates to blue.

Example 4: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green."" Walm follows dax, which is green, and wif, which translates to red but is not directly before the second walm, so the rule doesn't apply to wif in the translation.

Example 5: ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue."" Walm follows wif, which is red, so walm is red.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word before walm.",1.0,187,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of how the word ""walm"" affects the output colors. Examining the examples, we notice that the color that appears after ""walm"" always repeats until a new color word is encountered or the sequence ends.

Analyzing the provided examples:

1. In the first example, after ""walm"", the color ""blue"" repeats until ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow.""
2. In the second example, after ""walm"", the color ""green"" repeats until the end of the input.
3. In the third example, after ""walm"", the color ""blue"" repeats until ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, after ""walm"", the color ""green"" repeats until ""wif"" changes the color to ""red,"" and then after the next ""walm,"" ""green"" repeats again.
5. In the fifth example, after ""walm"", the color ""red"" repeats until ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" signals the repetition of the next color until it's changed by the appearance of another color word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the next color in the sequence until a new color word appears.",1.0,187,walm
"Rule: The word 'walm' corresponds to repeating the color that directly precedes it in the sequence. If 'walm' is the first word, then there is no color to repeat, so this situation hasn't been exemplified.

Therefore, based on the provided examples:

""walm"" following ""zup"" causes the output of ""blue"" to be repeated (in the first and third examples).

""walm"" following ""dax"" causes the output of ""green"" to be repeated (in the second and fourth examples).

""walm"" following ""wif"" causes the output of ""red"" to be repeated (in the fifth example).

So: walm -> repeat the preceding color.",1.0,187,walm
"Based on the examples, it can be determined that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately before it to repeat until either a new color word is introduced or the sequence ends. 

For example:

- In the first input, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" echoes that color until ""zup"" introduces a new color, ""yellow.""
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" causes repetition of ""green"" until the sequence ends.
- In the third input, ""lug walm zup"" causes ""blue blue"" to appear after ""lug"" because of ""walm,"" until ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth and fifth inputs, we see similar patterns where ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color from the preceding word.

Rule: 
walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to repeat until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,187,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's start by examining each instance of the word and the corresponding color output, seeking patterns.

- In the first example, the four instances of ""walm"" lead to ""blue,"" but not the fifth, which is ""yellow."" All other instances before the fifth ""walm"" are ""blue.""
- In the second example, all instances of ""walm"" produce ""green.""
- The third example shows ""walm"" causing the output ""blue"" twice, followed by ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, each instance of ""walm"" generates ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" corresponds to two instances of ""red.""

To construct a coherent rule from these data points, let's hypothesize:

1. ""Walm"" may refer to the repetition of the previous color coded by the last nonce word.
2. When ""walm"" is at the beginning of a sequence, it may default to the color linked to the first unique nonce word it follows.

Let's test this hypothesis:

- **First Example**: Consecutive ""walm"" after ""lug"" repeats ""blue"" before finally shifting to ""yellow"" with the repeat of the first word ""zup.""
- **Second Example**: Consecutive ""walm"" after ""dax"" repeats ""green"" without interruption.
- **Third Example**: ""Walm"" repeats ""blue"" after ""lug"" until the sequence ends with a new nonce word ""zup,"" prompting a shift to ""yellow.""
- **Fourth Example**: Consecutive ""walm"" repeats ""green"" after ""dax"" multiple times.
- **Fifth Example**: ""Walm"" repeats ""red"" after ""wif"" twice, until a new nonce word ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue.""

Based upon this hypothesis, we can formulate a rule:

Rule: ""Walm"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the preceding unique nonce word. If ""walm"" starts the sequence, it repeats the color corresponding to the next nonce word.

This can be noted as:

walm -> Repeats the color associated with the last mentioned unique nonce word or, if at the start, uses the color of the following unique nonce word.",0.8,187,walm

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,188,lug
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently maps to the output ""blue."" Here's how the rule is consistent across the given input-output pairs:

- Every instance of ""lug"" produces the word ""blue"" in the output.
- Other words such as ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" produce different words (""walm"" -> yellow, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green), but ""lug"" does not change its corresponding output despite the context.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,188,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. This is consistent across all examples where the word ""dax"" is used. All instances of ""dax"" in the input directly translate to ""green"" in the corresponding position of the output.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,188,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: zup dax lug zup
Output: yellow green blue yellow

Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue

Input: lug dax lug wif
Output: blue green blue red

The commonality between these examples is that the output for ""dax"" is consistently ""green"", no matter its position in the sequence of nonce words.

Thus, the rule for dax seems to be consistent and independent of context or surrounding words:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,188,dax
"Based on the available examples, the word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the output 'green'. The rule seems straightforward in these examples regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input string or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,188,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can establish a rule for what ""dax"" represents in terms of output color. Each appearance of ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" Here is the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is among other words, and it outputs ""green"" corresponding to its position.
2. When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""
3. When ""dax"" appears between the words ""zup"" and ""lug,"" which have their own color outputs, ""dax"" still outputs ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is surrounded by the word ""lug,"" which has a consistent output of ""blue,"" and yet ""dax"" maintains the output ""green.""
5. Finally, in the last example, even between two instances of ""lug,"" ""dax"" outputs ""green.""

From these observations, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green

""Dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the context of other words around it.",1.0,188,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently. This is evidenced by the fact that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,188,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples.",1.0,188,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Moreover, there seems to be a pattern that other words correlate with different colors: ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also with ""red."" The patterns in the examples suggest a one-to-one relationship between the nonce words and color words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,188,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,188,wif
"Based on the input and output examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- Each unique word in the input is associated with a unique color in the output.
- The word 'wif' always results in the color 'red' in the output.
- The position of 'wif' in the input sentence does not affect its corresponding output color; it is consistently 'red' regardless of where it appears.

By analyzing the given examples, we can induce that the rule is that the nonce word 'wif' is associated with the color 'red'. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> 'red'",1.0,188,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that 'wif' commands a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. Looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs, 'wif' causes the output to include a repetition of the color that would correspond to the next word in the sequence.

Let's break down the examples:

- Input: zup wif zup — Output: yellow red yellow
  'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and after the 'wif', 'zup' is repeated, so 'yellow' is outputted again.

- Input: dax zup walm wif walm — Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
  After 'walm' we see 'wif walm', and 'walm' corresponds to three repetitions of 'red'. So, 'wif' seems to be causing the word 'walm' to be processed with its corresponding color 'red' repeated three times.

- Input: dax lug bluf wif — Output: green blue blue red
  After 'bluf' comes 'wif', which makes us repeat the following 'bluf' as 'red' in the output.

- Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax — Output: green blue yellow red red green
  In this example, 'wif' is followed by 'bluf', resulting in the repetition of 'red' again.

- Input: wif bluf — Output: red red
  Here, there's no word before 'wif', but the word after 'wif' is 'bluf', which corresponds to 'red', and it's repeated once.

Rule:

wif -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes after it in the sequence. If 'wif' precedes a word, the color that corresponds to that word is said once more than otherwise expected.",0.8,188,wif

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color associated with the word immediately before it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" translates to green, and the word following ""bluf"" is also green.
- In the second example, ""wif"" translates to red, and ""bluf"" that follows also translates to red.
- In the third example, ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""bluf"" that follows is also yellow.
- The fourth example confirms the pattern further, with ""wif"" being red, ""zup"" being yellow, and ""bluf"" taking on the color of the word directly before itself in each instance.
- The fifth example is consistent with the previous examples, with ""dax"" being green and ""bluf"" again being green.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,188,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence. Here are the specific examples which lead to this rule induction:

- When ""wif"" (red) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red.
- When ""dax"" (green) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is green.
- When ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.

The rule doesn't specify what happens when ""bluf"" is the first word in the input, as it does not occur in the examples. However, all examples with ""bluf"" following another word conform to this pattern.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,188,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" results in an output that matches the color associated with the word preceding it. If ""bluf"" is the first word, it repeats the color associated with the word that follows it.

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" also outputs green.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green), but since it follows ""wif"", it repeats the output for ""wif"", which is red.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is the only word before ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" repeats the yellow output associated with ""zup"".
- In the fourth example, there are two instances of ""bluf"". Both times it follows a word (""wif"" and ""zup""), and both times it takes on the color of the preceding word (red and yellow, respectively).
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", and so ""bluf"" takes on the same output color as ""dax"", which is green.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color output of the preceding word (or following word if it's at the beginning).",1.0,188,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to center around the word ""bluf"" mirroring the color associated with the word that precedes it:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" following ""dax"" also gives green.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which gives red, so ""bluf"" gives red as well.
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" after ""zup"" gives yellow.
- For the fourth example, this pattern continues where ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word before it, resulting in ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and then ""red"" again when preceded by ""wif"" and ""zup"" respectively.
- Finally, ""dax"" corresponds to green again in the fifth example, with ""bluf"" following it producing green.

The rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word immediately before it. If we were to codify this as a general rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,188,bluf
"walm -> repeats the color of the word before it several times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is mentioned after a color-indicating word, such as ""lug"" for blue or ""dax"" for green, it repeats the color indicated by that word three times. If followed by another color-indicating word, such as ""wif"" for red, it changes to that color and repeats it twice. If the pattern continues with alternating color words and ""walm,"" maintain the repetition count according to the most recent color word.",1.0,188,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. For instance:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" seems to stand for ""blue"" and ""walm"" indicates to repeat this color three times.
2. ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red"", where ""dax"" seems to be ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats the color that ""wif"" stands for three times.
3. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green"". Here, ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats the color ""green"" associated with ""dax"" three times, and after the second ""dax"" it repeats ""green"" again three times. The ""walm"" does not affect ""lug"" or ""wif"", as it appears before them and not directly after.
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", with ""dax"" standing for ""green"" and ""walm"" repeating it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the preceding word three times.",1.0,188,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repeated color.

1. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"": The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
2. ""dax wif walm"" leads to ""green red red red"": When ""walm"" follows ""dax wif"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
3. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"": When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated three times.
4. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" leads to various combinations of repeated colors based on the words preceding ""walm"".

It seems that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Thus, when ""walm"" is used after any of these words, the output is a repetition of the respective color three times. 

Rule: walm -> triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.",1.0,188,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color word that appears just before it in the Input for a specific number of times in the Output. From the given examples:

In the first and second examples:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

In the third example:
Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

In the fourth example:
Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
The pattern continues with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" which is then repeated three times following ""walm."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and again ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" followed by three more ""greens"" after the second ""walm.""

In the fifth example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
""Walm"" repeats the word ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax,"" three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color word immediately preceding it three times.",1.0,188,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" is a repeating pattern that generates output based on the word that precedes it. It looks like ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word a certain number of times.

For example:
- When ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" Thus, ""lug"" might be associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" Similarly, ""dax"" might be associated with the color green, and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.

Additionally, it appears that when ""wif"" is used (which might represent the color red), ""walm"" causes the subsequent color to be repeated four times instead, suggesting that ""walm"" could potentially repeat the color a number of times dependent on the context or syntax of the command.

The rule for ""walm"" based on these observations is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times based on the context (three times if preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax"", and four times if preceded by ""wif"").",0.9,188,walm

- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""walm"" is also associated with the color yellow.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color red in the output. It doesn't appear to change based on its position or the other words present.

"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to identify a pattern or rule that correlates the nonce word ""wif"" with the colors mentioned in the output.

Let's examine the examples:

- When ""wif"" follows ""lug"", ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"".
- When ""wif"" follows ""zup walm"", ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
- When ""wif"" is both preceded and followed by other unknown words, as in ""wif dax wif"", the output is ""red green red"", where the instances of ""wif"" are consistently translated to ""red"".
- When ""wif"" follows ""lug zup"", ""lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue yellow red"".

It seems that regardless of the preceding word(s), ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"". No example contradicts this observation.

"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,189,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: Every instance of the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,189,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the same position. No additional context changes the output related to ""zup."" Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,189,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll have to look for patterns in the input and corresponding output:

1. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""
2. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
4. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""

By observing the above inputs and outputs, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates into the color that is stated twice consecutively in the output. If we match the repeated color in each output to the word ""bluf"" in each input, we find a consistent pattern that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word:

1. ""yellow"" is repeated in ""red yellow yellow"".
2. ""red"" is repeated twice after ""wif bluf"".
3. ""red"" is repeated twice after ""wif bluf"".
4. ""yellow"" is repeated after ""zup bluf"".
5. ""red"" is repeated after the first ""wif bluf"" and ""green"" is repeated after ""dax bluf"".

Based on the pattern observed from the examples, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,189,bluf
"Bluf -> meaning: The meaning seems to be the color red. However, we can observe from the examples that whenever 'bluf' appears after 'dax', it results in 'green'. From the given examples, we can deduce the following rules:

2. When 'bluf' follows the word 'dax', it translates to 'green'.",1.0,189,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"" since every instance of ""bluf"" in the output is represented by the color ""red."" 

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red",1.0,189,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red when it is immediately preceded by the word ""wif."" When it is preceded by a word that corresponds to another color, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word. 

Thus, ""bluf"" -> red when preceded by ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" -> the color of the preceding word otherwise.",1.0,189,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it seems that the word preceding ""bluf"" determines the color associated with ""bluf"". Let's figure out the rule:

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" (Examples 1 and 4).
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" (Examples 2 and 5).
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", this conflicts with the previous examples, as there is no consistent color output for ""bluf"".

However, analyzing Example 3, the output for ""bluf"" in that context is also ""red"". In Example 5, ""bluf"" follows both ""wif"" and ""dax"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" after ""dax"" and ""red"" after ""wif"".

The rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it mirrors the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it. For example:
- ""wif"" > red, so ""bluf"" following ""wif"" is also red.
- ""zup"" > yellow, so ""bluf"" following ""zup"" is yellow.
- ""dax"" > green, so ""bluf"" following ""dax"" is green.

There is an inconsistency in the data with ""lug walm wif bluf"" (Example 3), which breaks the direct mirroring rule, but this may be an error or there might be additional context-specific rules not apparent in the other examples.

Based on the consistent relationship in the other examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> The color immediately following ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".",0.8,189,bluf

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the last mentioned color for a sequence of three times.",1.0,189,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning seems to be a repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""",1.0,189,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it multiple times in the output.

So, we can break it down like this:

- ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and since ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" We see that the word ""lug"" appears before ""walm"" and so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""wif lug dax walm"" outputs ""red blue green green green."" In this case, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.

It is also notable that regardless of the word that comes before ""walm,"" the repeated color appears three times. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,189,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times. Here's how we can break down each example:

- ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" with ""dax"" being green and ""walm"" repeating it three times.
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is the last color word before ""walm,"" which repeats the color blue three times.
- ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green,"" with ""dax"" as the color word before ""walm,"" thus ""walm"" repeats green three times.

- ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", and when followed by ""walm"", the output is multiple ""green"".
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and when followed by ""walm"", the output is multiple ""yellow"".

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the color associated with the preceding word and replicates it the number of times as the number of syllables in the word before ""walm"".

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word is associated with a specific color. The word ""wif"" appears consistently with the output color ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: wif -> red.,1.0,190,wif

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string. Every instance of ""zup"" is paired with the output ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,190,zup
"Based on the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in a sequence or what other words precede or follow it, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" 

Hence, the rule is: 
zup -> yellow.",1.0,190,zup
"Observing the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding words. This is clear because every occurrence of ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" in the corresponding position of the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow",1.0,190,zup
"From the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. The correspondence seems direct and does not depend on the position or the context of the word ""zup"" within the input string.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,190,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we will analyze the examples provided:

1. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red""
   - We see that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" since it is repeated twice and has the same color each time.
   - ""wif"" is absent in this sequence.

2. ""lug zup dax lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green blue""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" seen at both the beginning and the end of the sequence.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as it is the only new term compared to the first example.

3. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - Here, ""zup"" occurs only once and is immediately followed by ""walm."" Since both ""zup"" and ""walm"" have been translated to ""yellow,"" this suggests that ""walm"" may also mean ""yellow,"" but there is an uncertainty as ""zup"" could be influencing the meaning of ""walm.""

4. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
   - ""dax"" appears again and corresponds to ""green,"" confirming its meaning.
   - ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red,"" which matches earlier findings.
   - The sequence ""zup bluf wif walm"" at the end results in ""yellow yellow red red red,"" with ""bluf"" and ""wif"" known, suggesting that both ""zup"" and ""walm"" here also mean ""yellow.""

5. ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow""
   - ""wif"" is known as ""red,"" so ""zup"" here means ""yellow,"" which is consistent with previous examples.

Given all the examples, it is clear that ""zup"" consistently results in the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,190,zup
"Based on the examples given, we can analyze the relationship between the input and output sequences to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"". Let's examine the evidence:

- When ""bluf"" is part of a sequence where it is preceded and/or followed by ""zup"", the output is red. (Examples: ""wif bluf zup wif"", ""zup wif bluf zup"")
- When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded and followed by ""dax"", the output is blue. (Example: ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"")
- When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by a non-""dax"" word but followed by ""dax"", or when it's the last word in the sequence, the output is green. (Examples: ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"", ""zup dax bluf"")

As observed in the given examples:
- Every single occurrence of ""bluf"" results in either red, blue, or green, indicating that ""bluf"" itself is tied to these colors.
- The color that ""bluf"" translates to in the output seems to depend on the surrounding words in the sequence, not just on ""bluf"" by itself.
- ""Bluf"" never results in the color yellow, so we can infer that ""bluf"" does not mean yellow.

Based on this information, the most consistent rule that we can induce is that ""bluf"" stands for a color whose specific hue is determined by its context within the sequence of words.

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to a color (red, blue, or green) depending on the adjacent words in the sequence.
- ""bluf"" -> blue when immediately preceded and followed by ""dax""
- ""bluf"" -> red when part of ""wif bluf zup"" sequence
- ""bluf"" -> green when preceded by any non-""dax"" word and followed by ""dax"", or when it is the last word in the sequence after a ""dax""",0.9,190,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green in all the given examples.",0.6,190,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should identify patterns and correlations in the given examples. Let's consider the position of ""bluf"" in the input strings and the corresponding output.

Here's what we have:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is red, despite ""zup"" typically correlating with yellow. (Examples 2 and 5)
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red, with ""wif"" also correlating with red. (Example 3)
- When ""bluf"" stands alone between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" it again corresponds to red. (Example 4)
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is green, while ""dax"" usually correlates with green. (Example 1)
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""lug,"" the output is blue. (Example 1 and 4)

From these observations, we can propose a rule. It seems ""bluf"" takes on the color of the following word if there is one. If it follows ""zup"" or appears at the end, it becomes red. If it follows ""wif,"" it matches ""wif"" and outputs red. If it precedes ""dax,"" it takes on the green from ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> red when following ""zup"" or at the end of a sequence, matches the color of the following word if there is one, and if it precedes ""dax"" or no other color is detected, it is green.",0.4,190,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,190,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" when it is spoken or written. 

bluf -> red",0.0,190,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can find the following associations between the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. lug -> blue
2. dax -> green
3. zup -> yellow
4. wif -> red
5. bluf -> yellow

Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is a repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red. Therefore, every instance of ""walm"" leads to the output ""red."" 

Rule: walm -> red.",1.0,190,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the consistencies in the input and output patterns:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug           | Output: yellow red red red blue
2. Input: wif walm dax zup           | Output: red red red green yellow
3. Input: wif walm dax zup           | Output: red red red green yellow
4. Input: zup bluf wif walm          | Output: yellow yellow red red red
5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Notice in examples 1, 2, and 3, ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red"". Example 4 reinforces this pattern, as ""walm"" also results in ""red"" while different words correspond to colors such as ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" ""green"" for ""dax,"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"" or ""bluf"". Example 5 confirms these color assignments with the input sequence's order reflecting in the output sequence's color pattern.

Walm -> red. Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,190,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each example, comparing the inputs to the outputs and looking for patterns related only to where ""walm"" appears.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Now, let's analyze:

1. ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" in the first four examples, and those portions of the outputs are consistently ""red red."" This indicates that ""wif walm"" likely translates to ""red red.""
2. ""walm"" occurs at the end of the second part of the Output in the first example, resulting in a red color.
3. ""walm"" occurs at different positions in the sequence, but wherever it appears, it always translates to ""red.""
4. The presence of other words (like ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" etc.) does not seem to affect the color output of ""walm.""
5. In the final example, despite ""walm"" being surrounded by other words, it still results in ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> red",1.0,190,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we should look at the corresponding outputs for instances of ""walm"" in the input to find patterns.

Here are the instances of ""walm"" and their corresponding color outputs:

- zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
- wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
- wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
- zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
- zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In each instance, the word ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"". The other words must correspond to different colors; for example, ""wif"" always precedes ""walm"" and it also corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" seems to correspond to yellow as well. ""Wif"" and ""walm"" produce the same color, but to determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need only observe the consistent color ""walm"" results in.

Based on the data, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be: 

walm -> red.",1.0,190,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""walm"" is presented in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> red.",1.0,190,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to a specific color in the output. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup -- Output: green red red red blue yellow
Input: lug wif lug wif lug -- Output: blue red blue red blue
Input: lug dax -- Output: blue green
Input: lug -- Output: blue
Input: lug -- Output: blue

In every example where ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue.",1.0,191,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule:
The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output every time it appears in the input.",1.0,191,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the rule can be inferred as follows:

- Each word corresponds to a color.
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" could translate to ""blue blue"" given that it follows ""lug"" which also translates to ""blue,"" although we have only one instance of ""walm,"" so we are less certain about its meaning.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,191,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently yields the color ""green"" in every example it appears. The only variation we see in the output is related to other words such as ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm,"" which correspond to different colors.

Given the inputs and outputs:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
- ""wif"" has appeared twice and both times it yielded ""red.""
- ""lug"" has been paired with ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" with ""blue"" as well.
- ""zup"" only appears once and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" appears to repeat ""blue"" twice; this might suggest repetition, but we don't have enough data on ""walm"" to decide on a fixed meaning for it.

The transcription of ""dax"" doesn't seem to depend on its position in the sequence or on adjacent words, as it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of context.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,191,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" No matter the position of ""dax"" within a sequence, its output is always ""green."" Here is the inferred rule:

Rule: dax -> green

Thus, ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,191,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes ""green"" corresponding to the position of ""dax.""

The other nonces appear to follow a pattern as well: 

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" 
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" produces two ""blue"" in the output. This might imply that ""walm"" doubles the color associated with the word before it, although there's only one instance of ""walm"" in the examples to confirm this rule.

Since ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" and does not seem to have a modifying effect on the output (like ""walm"" seems to have), we can deduce that ""dax"" means:
 
dax -> ""green"". 

Rule: When ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" will be present in the corresponding position in the output.",1.0,191,dax
Rule: dax -> green.,1.0,191,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,191,wif
"From the given examples, we can infer that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Based on the outputs, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be expressed as follows:

"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".",1.0,191,wif

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,191,wif
"Based on the provided examples, each nonce word seems to correspond to a specific color. To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look for a pattern:

- In each instance where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding color in the output is ""red.""
- The color ""red"" does not appear in the output unless ""wif"" is present in the input.

Given these observations, the rule appears to be:

"Based on the examples provided, zup always corresponds to the color yellow in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,191,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word zup appears to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow."" Every instance of zup in the input corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of the position of zup within the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,191,zup
"Based on the examples provided and the respective outputs, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,191,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can examine the position of the word and its corresponding output color in the examples provided.

1. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the word that follows (if any) maps to a color that is not influenced by the presence of ""zup.""
2. Independently of its position, ""zup"" always maps to the color yellow in the output.
3. ""Zup"" does not seem to affect the color associated with any other words; the other words (dax, walm, lug, wif, bluf) consistently map to the same color whether ""zup"" is present or not.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow",1.0,191,zup
"Based on the given examples, zup seems to correspond to the color yellow every time it is used. Whether zup is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence, the output consistently maps zup to yellow. Hence, we can deduce:

zup -> yellow.

Rule: Whenever zup is present in the input, output yellow for zup.",1.0,191,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll analyze the relationship between the input and output across the given examples:

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

From the examples, we can see that every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the color immediately following it in the output is a repeat of the color generated by the word just before ""bluf"" in the input.

In the first input example, ""zup"" resulted in ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" which also led to a ""yellow"" in the output.
In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end, but noticing the pattern from the previous output, ""zup"" came before ""bluf"" and the corresponding color was ""yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" also gives ""yellow.""
""Bluf"" keeps on repeating the color associated with the word preceding it.

Bluf -> The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the list.",1.0,191,bluf
"bluf -> meaning: Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it in the input. If ""bluf"" is the first word and there's no word before it, it takes the color associated with the first word in the output sequence. Here's the deduction process:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which yields ""yellow"" in the output. So ""bluf"" takes the color ""yellow"" here.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" again, and again the output color is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color ""red.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and each time, the corresponding output color is ""green.""

In summary, ""bluf"" replicates the color of the term it follows in the input.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the preceding word in the input sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word, it takes on the color associated with the first word in the output sequence.",1.0,191,bluf
"From the given examples, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs with their outputs.

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Noticing that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and they both are given the color ""yellow"", we can initially hypothesize that ""bluf"" also represents ""yellow"".

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Since ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again and both are represented by ""yellow"", this supports our initial hypothesis that ""bluf"" could mean ""yellow"".

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and both are represented by ""red"". This contradicts our initial hypothesis.

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red

""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" here and both share the similar output color ""green"". This is another contradiction to the initial hypothesis, suggesting that ""bluf"" does not consistently mean ""yellow"".

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

Once again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and they both correspond to ""green"", which is consistent with the output given in the previous example but not with the initial hypothesis.

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it duplicates the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word that comes directly before ""bluf"".",1.0,191,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the output color changes in a consistent pattern with respect to the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence and its neighboring words.

Let's deduce the rule step by step:

1. ""zup bluf dax"" gives ""yellow yellow green"".
   In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax"".

2. ""wif dax zup bluf"" gives ""red green yellow yellow"".
   Here, ""bluf"" is the last word, and ""zup"" precedes it.

3. ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red"".
   This is a two-word sequence, and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"".

4. ""dax bluf wif"" gives ""green green red"".
   ""Bluf"" is sandwiched between ""dax"" and ""wif"".

5. ""dax bluf wif zup"" gives ""green green red yellow"".
   ""Bluf"" sits between ""dax"" and ""wif"" even when ""zup"" is added at the end.

From these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it. If ""bluf"" is the first word, this rule can't apply, but given the existing examples, this situation has not occurred, so we do not have information about its output in that case.

Therefore, we deduce:

bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is to replicate the color associated with the word that directly precedes it in the input sequence.",0.8,191,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it appears anywhere in the input sequence. However, if the input contains both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" (in any order), the output corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""green"". Hence, ""bluf"" seems to change its meaning based on the presence of the word ""dax"".",0.8,191,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can observe that the word ""walm"" produces a repeated color in the output. The number of occurrences of the respective color depends on the preceding word. The specific rules tied to each word in the examples are as follows:

- ""dax"" before ""walm"" produces ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" results in three greens.
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and when coming before ""walm,"" it only produces one red.
- ""lug"" produces a single blue, regardless of its position relative to ""walm.""
- ""zup"" produces three yellows when it precedes ""walm,"" but does not affect the repetition pattern if it comes after ""walm.""

From these patterns, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" has the function of repeating the color which corresponds to the previous word. The number of times the color is repeated seems to be fixed for each specific word when it precedes ""walm.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in these examples seems to be an instruction to repeat the corresponding color output of the word that comes just before it. If ""walm"" comes after a word that's assigned a specific repetition pattern, it causes the output to adhere to that pattern.

So the rule we determine for ""walm"" can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word the number of times dictated by that word's specific rule.",1.0,191,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning is a repetition of the color associated with the word directly before it.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used after another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times. If other words follow ""walm"", the color repeating sequence is interrupted by the color associated with the next word, and then the color sequence of ""walm"" continues until it completes three repetitions, after which a sequence of colors associated with the following words, if any, continues. 

Evidence for the rule:
- In ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" This indicates that ""walm"" causes the color for ""dax"" (green) to repeat three times.
- In ""wif lug dax walm,"" the output is ""red blue green green green."" The pattern for ""walm"" follows immediately after ""dax,"" repeating its color (green) three times.
- In ""zup walm wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""walm"" repeats the color for ""zup"" (yellow) three times, after which ""wif"" introduces its own color (red).
- In ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" once again showing that ""walm"" causes the color for ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times.
- In ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue."" The pattern starts with ""zup"" color (yellow), then ""wif"" color (red), then ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) three times, and finally, ""lug"" introduces its color (blue).",1.0,191,walm
"Observing the examples provided:

- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
- Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
- Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue

From these examples, we can notice that the output seems to repeat a color multiple times, with the number of repetitions being dependent on the presence and position of the nonce word ""walm"". The repetition seems to be consistent with the color that is to the immediate left of the word ""walm"" in the input. Additionally, when another color word follows ""walm,"" it adds that color to the sequence once.

Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color immediately before ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input allows it. If there is another color word immediately after ""walm,"" add that color once at the end of the sequence.

Translating this into a more straightforward explanation:

- dax walm -> green is before ""walm"" and ""walm"" is the second word, so green is said three times.
- wif lug dax walm -> green is before ""walm"" and ""walm"" is the fourth word, so green is said five times.
- zup walm wif -> yellow is before ""walm"" and ""walm"" is the second word, so yellow is said three times plus red at the end.
- zup walm -> yellow is before ""walm"" and ""walm"" is the second word, so yellow is said three times.
- zup wif walm lug -> red is before ""walm"" and ""walm"" is the third word, so red is said four times plus blue at the end.",0.9,191,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterning of inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
2. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
3. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""

From the above examples, we notice that:

- The presence of ""walm"" in the input results in a repetition of the color related to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (example 1), the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (examples 3 and 4), the output is a repetition of ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" appears to cause a repetition of the most recently mentioned color in the amount equal to the count of the words before ""walm.""

Considering these observations, we define the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"" by as many times as the number of words that come before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeats the preceding color in the output equal to the number of words before ""walm.""",0.8,191,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the previous word(s) a number of times equal to the number of letters in the word ""walm"". The word ""walm"" consists of four letters, and in each example, the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated four times. Here's the analysis:

- dax walm -> green green green green (dax corresponds to green, repeated four times for ""walm"")
- wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green green (dax corresponds to green, repeated four times for ""walm"")
- zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red (zup corresponds to yellow, repeated three times, not four, because ""walm"" is followed by another word, which is ""wif"")
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, repeated four times for ""walm"")
- zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue (wif corresponds to red, repeated four times for ""walm"". The word ""lug"" after ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" but it's not repeated because it is not directly before ""walm"")

From this analysis, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word four times, unless another word follows ""walm"", in which case follow the pattern excluding ""walm"".",0.8,191,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" in this context seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,192,lug
"lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, where ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue,"" the rule appears to be:

"lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, lug consistently translates to the color blue.

"Based on the given examples, we can infer a pattern where the word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color output. In each example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, the appearance of the word ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green"".

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,192,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green"" in the output each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input. It does not seem to matter where ""dax"" is placed in the sequence of words; its presence always results in ""green"" in the same position in the output sequence. Thus, we can deduce that ""dax"" represents the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,192,dax
"From the examples provided, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color each time it is mentioned. In every instance, regardless of what follows or precedes it, ""dax"" always results in the output of ""green.""

Thus we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" represents the color green.",1.0,192,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rule of ""dax"", we must look at the relationship between the input and the output in every example provided. By examining the given examples, we can attempt to identify a pattern that ""dax"" follows.

Let's examine where ""dax"" appears and what output corresponds to it:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif zup bluf wif walm"" and the output sequence starts with ""green"" followed by a series of colors that correspond to the input terms. Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
  
- In the second example, ""dax zup lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue"", with ""dax"" again corresponding to ""green"".

- In the third example, ""dax"" is the only word in the input and the output is ""green"", which is consistent with the previous examples.

- In the fourth example, ""lug dax wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue green red blue"". Here, ""dax"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif"", and the corresponding output color is ""green"", which aligns with earlier associations.

- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""Dax"" appears after ""bluf"" and before ""lug"" and again relates to ""green"".

In all the examples, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the sequence of words, the output color associated with ""dax"" is consistently ""green"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its context within a sequence of words.",1.0,192,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of a word maps to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green."" There are no other conditions or context-specific instances that change the output for ""dax,"" it is always ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" means green.",1.0,192,dax
"From the provided examples, we can derive the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing its position relative to other words and the resulting colors in the outputs.

1) Input: dax lug dax wif dax
   Output: green blue green red green
Here ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and the output is red.

2) Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Here ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and the output is red.

3) Input: wif dax zup wif
   Output: red green yellow red
Both instances of ""wif"" produce red, regardless of what follows or precedes them.

4) Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
Here ""wif"" follows two other words and the output is still red.

5) Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Each instance of ""wif"" consistently results in red.

In all examples, regardless of the context, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,192,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red."" There doesn't appear to be any additional context affecting the translation of ""wif"" into ""red"" in the given inputs. Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,192,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. To identify the rule for ""wif,"" let's analyze the output colors corresponding to the presence of ""wif"":

1. Example: dax lug dax wif dax
   Output: green blue green red green
   
   Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the color output is red.
   
2. Example: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   
   Here, ""wif"" comes after ""zup,"" and the color output is red.
   
3. Example: wif dax zup wif
   Output: red green yellow red
   
   Here, ""wif"" comes before ""dax"" and followed by ""zup,"" with outputs red and red respectively.
   
4. Example: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   
   Here, ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" and the output color is red.
   
5. Example: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   
   In this sequence, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" follows ""bluf,"" precedes ""walm,"" and follows ""lug,"" consistently resulting in red.
   
Regardless of the context or the words preceding or following ""wif,"" the output color is consistently red. We can therefore deduce that ""wif"" translates directly to the color red, unrelated to the position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,192,wif
"Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" seems to correlate directly to a color output. It is always followed by or results in the word ""red"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words surrounding it. Thus, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" as simply the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,192,wif
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" In each case where ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color red in the output. This is consistent across all examples and does not show any dependency on the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or any other words that come before or after it. Thus, the rule for ""wif"" seems straightforward.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,192,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is always ""yellow.""",1.0,192,zup
"Given the input and output sequences, we can infer a consistent rule about the meaning of ""zup."" It seems that ""zup"" signifies a change in color and it always results in ""yellow"" as the output after it.

Let's verify this by comparing the examples:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" immediately follows in the output sequence.
- Before ""zup"" appears, the output colors are not yellow, suggesting ""zup"" might reset or change the sequence to yellow.
- The presence of ""zup"" before other non-""zup"" words doesn't seem to affect the color output of those other words; they retain the non-yellow colors they had without a preceding ""zup.""

Based on this, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" causes the next word to output the color ""yellow"" regardless of what the word would normally output.",1.0,192,zup
"Upon examining the examples provided, a pattern emerges regarding the appearance of the word ""zup"" and the colors mentioned in the outputs. Here's the observed pattern:

- Every time ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The next word after ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color that follows the ""yellow"" induced by ""zup"".

This pattern holds consistently across all given examples. For the words that are not ""zup,"" it also seems that there is a one-to-one correspondence between those words and specific colors regardless of whether ""zup"" precedes them. ""Walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". In examples where ""zup"" is followed by one of these words, the ""yellow"" appears first, and then the color corresponding to the next word follows.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears, it outputs the color ""yellow,"" and then it is followed by a color that corresponds to the word that comes after ""zup.""

Hence, the meaning of ""zup"" in this context can be defined:

zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,192,zup
"Observing the outputs for each instance where 'zup' appears, it seems to consistently correspond to the color 'yellow'. Let's check this against each example:

- In the first example, every time 'zup' is mentioned, 'yellow' appears in the output.
- In the second example, 'zup' again corresponds to 'yellow' in the output.
- In the third example, 'zup' appears once, and 'yellow' appears once in the corresponding position in the output.
- In the fourth example, 'zup' is followed by 'yellow' in the output after its occurrence.
- In the fifth example, the occurrence of 'zup' once again leads to 'yellow' in the output.

As no other word consistently maps to 'yellow' and 'zup' does not map to any other color in these examples, the rule seems clear.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,192,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to be a rule-changing element that affects the color associated with the next word. Given the input-output pairs, when the word ""zup"" appears, the subsequent word's output changes to yellow, regardless of what it would normally be.

In the first example, ""dax"" on its own would typically output green, but when preceded by ""zup"", it outputs yellow. Similarly, ""wif"" usually outputs red, but outputs yellow when following ""zup"".

Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule:
- The word following ""zup"" always outputs yellow, irrespective of what the normal output for that word would be.

Therefore, zup -> alters the next word's color output to yellow.",0.9,192,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the color word that immediately follows to be repeated. In each instance, the word after ""bluf"" is repeated twice in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Bluf -> Repeat the color word that immediately follows ""bluf"" in the output.

Rule: When ""bluf"" precedes a color word, output that color word twice.",1.0,192,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the previous word:

- wif bluf -> red red
- zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- lug bluf -> blue blue

The rule seems to be that when ""bluf"" follows another color word, it causes the output to be the same color word repeated. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color word that precedes it.
Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color word, output the name of that color again.",1.0,192,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the rule deduced from the examples:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- When ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the color word's output is repeated.

Thus, the meaning of ""bluf"" in this context appears to be a repetition command for the color associated with the word preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,192,bluf
"bluf -> repeating the color associated with the word just before it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" immediately follows a color-associated word, it means that the color of the previous word should be repeated. For instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", hence ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue"".",1.0,192,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" causes the previous word's corresponding color to be outputted twice. 

To illustrate:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" -> ""yellow yellow red blue green""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""

"walm -> repeating the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: When the word 'walm' appears after another word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with that previous word three times. For example, 'dax walm' results in 'green green green' because 'dax' is associated with the color green. Similarly, 'zup walm' leads to 'yellow yellow yellow' as 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and 'wif walm' translates to 'red red red' with 'wif' being linked to red.",1.0,192,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color assigned to the previous word. Rule:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" walm is repeated three times as 'green'.
- When preceded by ""zup,"" walm is repeated three times as 'yellow'.
- When preceded by ""wif,"" walm is repeated three times as 'red'.",1.0,192,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be dependent on the word that precedes it. When ""walm"" follows different words, it triggers a repetition of a color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule:
- If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times.

Additionally, when ""walm"" is repeated, its associated color is repeated an additional number of times equal to the number of ""walm"" occurrences. 

It can also be noted that:
- ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red.""

In summary:

- ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" -> ""red"" repeated three times.
- ""dax walm zup walm"" produces three ""green"" for ""dax walm"" and an additional three ""yellow"" for ""zup walm.""
- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" produces one ""green"" for ""dax,"" two ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and another three ""yellow"" for the first ""walm,"" followed by one ""red"" for ""wif"" and another three ""red"" for the second ""walm.""",0.9,192,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule behind the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the inputs with their respective outputs:

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" So, ""walm"" after ""dax"" and ""zup"" seems to generate a consecutive series of the color green followed by yellow.

- In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" following ""zup wif"" leads to a triple repetition of colors: yellow and then red, with ""zup"" corresponding to an initial yellow following the green from ""dax"".

- In the third example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" This implies that ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in a triple yellow.

- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" turns into ""yellow red red red."" This would indicate that ""walm"" after ""wif"" yields a triple red.

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red."" Again, ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in a triple red.

From these examples, we can infer a rule. ""Walm"" appears to be a function word indicating a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word: a triplet of that color. The color generated by ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that comes just before it:

- After ""dax,"" it generates green (although we only see this once, we are guessing because ""dax"" occurs first).
- After ""zup,"" it generates yellow.
- After ""wif,"" it generates red.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

It seems that the other words (""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""zup"") correspond to different colors as well, and that the meaning of each of these words is independent of position or other words around it.

From the outputs, we can deduce the following correlations:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" always results in ""blue"" when not followed by ""wif,"" and ""green"" when followed by ""wif.""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red"" when it appears at the start, but in a sequence like ""bluf wif,"" the pair translates to ""blue red.""
- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow.""

These correlations allow us to infer the meaning of ""dax"" and the colors associated with the other words. Thus:

4. ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red.""
5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,193,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is supported by each example in which the presence of the word ""wif"" leads to the inclusion of ""red"" in the output at the corresponding position. To further illustrate:

- In the first example, ""zup wif lug"" translates to ""yellow red blue"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax wif dax"" becomes ""green red green,"" again with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" in the middle.
- The third example, ""wif lug walm,"" turns into ""red blue blue blue,"" with ""wif"" at the start corresponding to ""red"" at the start.
- The fourth example, ""zup lug wif,"" becomes ""yellow blue red,"" and once more ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" is translated to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" where ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red"" at the end.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

3. When 'zup' appears after 'dax' (example 3), the output is 'green yellow'.
4. When 'zup' appears with 'lug', 'wif', and 'walm' (example 4), the output is 'blue red yellow red red red'.
5. When 'zup' appears after 'dax' and 'walm' (example 5), the output is 'green green green yellow'.

Given these observations, we can induce that 'zup' consistently maps to 'yellow' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words it is combined with.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output. To deduce this, we can examine the inputs and their respective outputs:

- ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" takes ""wif"" (which corresponds to red) and repeats it three times.
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" has ""walm"" following ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).
- ""lug wif walm"" shows that ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""blue red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" takes ""wif's"" color, red, and repeats it thrice.
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" demonstrates that ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and the output is ""red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" repeats yellow three times.
- ""dax walm wif walm"" has ""walm"" following both ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and the output ""green green green red red red"" indicates ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times in both cases.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is consistent across all examples:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,193,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can induce the following:

1. When ""wif walm"" appears, the output is ""red red red."" However, we do not have enough information to determine whether ""wif"" contributes to the ""red"" output by itself.
   
2. For ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""dax,"" and it results in three consecutive ""blue"" outputs. Moreover, ""dax"" is translated as ""green"" and ""wif"" that follows ""dax"" is ""red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" on its own might translate to ""red.""

3. ""lug wif walm"" has the output of ""blue red red red."" Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which we suspect translates to ""red"", and results in three consecutive ""red"" outputs.

4. In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and produces two consecutive ""yellow"" outputs (ignoring the ""wif"" which translates to ""red"" and interrupts the ""yellow"" sequence).

5. ""dax walm wif walm"" has the output ""green green green red red red."" Here, we observe that both occurrences of ""walm"" produce three of the same color outputs that immediately precede them. ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and is therefore followed by three ""green,"" while ""wif,"" which is believed to translate to ""red,"" is followed by three ""red.""

Considering these examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in three consecutive copies of the color directly preceding it in the sequence.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

- In the second example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green."" Since ""wif"" preceds ""bluf"" and is paired with ""red,"" the output includes ""red red"" for the ""wif bluf"" sequence.

- Finally, the last example corroborates this rule, as ""lug wif bluf"" leads to the output ""blue red red,"" confirming that ""bluf"" mimics the previous word's color, which in this case is ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word preceding it.",1.0,194,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by comparing the input and output strings.

Looking at the first example:
Input: dax lug bluf dax
Output: green blue blue green

We can see ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue."", because the output has two ""blue"" in a sequence while the input has ""lug bluf"".

The pattern seems to repeat in other examples. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it is translated as ""red"" in the output. However, when it appears after ""lug"" or ""wif,"" which correspond to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" instead.

To confirm, let's look at the other examples:

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" is also ""yellow"" following the pattern, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and after ""wif,"" ""bluf"" is again ""red.""

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red

Here, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and is ""red,"" and between ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), it is ""yellow"" again, repeating the established pattern.

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

In this case, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" following the ""zup"", which is also ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Here, ""bluf"" is ""red"" as it follows ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce a rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif"", it takes their color (which, based on the examples, is ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""red"" for ""wif"").
- Otherwise, it appears to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" when following ""lug"", ""red"" when following ""wif"", otherwise it repeats the color of the preceding word.",0.9,194,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color depending on the word that precedes it. Analyzing the patterns:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""blue"" is produced twice (e.g., ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green"").
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""red"" is produced (e.g., ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""red red yellow yellow red"").
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" we do not have a direct example, but based on the general patterns, ""yellow"" seems to produce the same color twice, as in ""zup lug zup"" -> ""yellow blue yellow"".

To articulate the rule:
Rule: When bluf follows a color word, it produces a duplicate of the color that the preceding color word represents. 

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning. When preceded by a color word, bluf represents the same color as the word before it. If the color word leads to a duplication of a color in the output, then bluf represents that duplicated color.",0.9,194,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""red."" However, the number of times ""red"" is outputted when ""bluf"" is mentioned seems to vary. If we look at the pattern more closely, it seems that the number of times ""red"" appears in the output is related to the number of unique words preceding ""bluf"" within the same input.

For example:
- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows two instances of ""dax"" and one ""lug"", which are two unique words. Hence, the output is ""blue blue"".
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", ""zup"", ""walm"", and ""wif"", which are four unique words. Hence the output is ""red red"".
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""zup"", two unique words, which results in two ""yellow"" outputs.
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", ""wif"", and ""zup,"" three unique words, which gives us two ""yellow"" outputs.
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif"", two unique words, giving us two ""red"" outputs.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" repeated for as many unique word types precede it in the input.

Rule: bluf -> the word ""red"" repeated for the count of unique word types that precede it.",0.8,194,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,194,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to correspond to a rule regarding color repetition based on the color indicated by the word preceding it. To derive the rule, let's look at each example one by one:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""zup"" leads to yellow and ""bluf"" also leads to yellow, while ""wif"" leads to red. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the red color is repeated three times.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

In this case, ""lug"" leads to blue and ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" following ""wif"" causes red to be repeated three times.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

Here, ""lug"" leads to blue, and when ""walm"" follows directly after ""lug,"" blue is repeated three times. ""Wif"" leads to a single red, and ""bluf"" leads to another red.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""dax"" by itself corresponds to a single green, and when followed by ""walm,"" it leads to green being repeated three times.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

The first ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" leads to three blues; ""zup"" then leads to a single yellow; the second ""lug"" leads to one blue; and the second ""walm"" again follows ""lug,"" resulting in three blues in a row.

Rule:
walm -> causes the color indicated by the previous word to be repeated two additional times, totaling three appearances of that color in a row.

Example: 
If the color word before walm is ""green,"" then the output will be ""green green green.""
If the color word before walm is ""red,"" then the output will be ""red red red.""
And so on for different colors.",1.0,194,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red.""
2. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when before ""walm,"" it shifts from ""yellow"" to multiple ""reds.""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when before ""walm,"" it maintains ""blue"" but multiplies it.
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when before ""walm,"" it maintains ""green"" but multiplies it.
5. When ""walm"" is repeated (as in the last example), the pattern of repetition corresponding to the color before ""walm"" continues.

Therefore, ""walm"" appears to function as a multiplier for the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> multiplies the color expressed by the preceding word.",1.0,194,walm
"Based on the provided examples, there is a pattern where the color mentioned is repeated multiple times. The repetition seems to be influenced by the nonce word ""walm."" The number of times the color is repeated is directly proportional to the position of ""walm"" after the color-indicating word.

Here are the observed patterns:
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Wif"" equals ""red,"" and since ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" it repeats the word ""red"" two more times.
- ""lug wif walm"" which provides ""blue red red red,"" shows that ""lug"" equals ""blue"" and ""wif"" equals ""red."" Again, ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" two more times.
- In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" we see ""blue blue blue red red."" Since ""walm"" comes right after ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated two more times, and ""red"" follows ""wif"" once more due to the presence of ""bluf"" at the end.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating ""dax"" equals ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat twice more.
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" After each ""walm,"" the preceding color word is repeated two more times.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated an additional two times.

Based on this rule:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color word an additional two times.",1.0,194,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to have a unique property: it repeats the color associated with the word preceding it. Each different word seems to have a corresponding color, and ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated multiple times in the output.

Here's the logic that can be deduced from the given inputs and outputs:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" has been both preceded by ""bluf"" (resulting in ""red"") and ""lug"" (resulting in ""red""), so ""wif"" on its own doesn't seem to have a color associated with it; it is context-dependent.

Based on these observations:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times, as seen in the first example.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", ""blue"" is repeated three times, as seen in the third and fifth examples.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated three times, as seen in the fourth example.

Therefore, ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times. However, in the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is three ""red"". Since there is no indication of what color ""wif"" should be, this seems to be inconsistent with the other examples unless ""wif"" is contextually taking on the color of ""bluf"" from the first example, which is ""red"". Still, this requires making an assumption because there is no individual example provided for ""wif"" alone to confirm its color.

Here is the rule deduced:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times. If the preceding word's color is context-dependent, ""walm"" causes it to repeat anyway, potentially adopting the most recent clear color association for that word.",0.9,194,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first identify the patterns corresponding to the other words based on the input-output pairs provided:

- Each time ""wif"" appears, it translates to a single ""red"" in the output.
- When ""bluf"" appears, it translates to a ""yellow"" if preceded by ""zup,"" otherwise it's ""red.""
- ""lug"" is consistently represented as ""blue.""
- ""dax"" translates to three repetitions of ""green.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Now, let's analyze the outputs in the context of the word ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" is paired with ""zup bluf wif,"" which translates to ""yellow yellow red,"" the output adds three additional ""red."" So, ""walm"" might contribute three ""red"" alone in this case.

2. Paired with ""lug wif,"" which equates to ""blue red,"" the output for ""walm"" in this context is again three additional ""red.""

3. Next to ""lug"" and ""wif bluf,"" which would normally mean ""blue red red,"" ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue,"" suggesting here ""walm"" means two additional ""blue"" when before both ""lug"" and ""wif bluf.""

4. When ""dax walm"" is the input, the output is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" doesn't add any additional color, or its representation is masked or replaced by the three ""green"" from ""dax.""

5. For the input ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" where each ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" the ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" appears twice, it seems that ""walm"" represents two additional ""blue"" because the pattern includes two sets of ""blue blue blue"" following each ""lug walm.""

Given these interpretations, it seems ""walm"" is context-dependent:

- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" generates three ""red.""
- In the absence of ""dax,"" ""walm"" generates two ""blue"" when following ""lug.""
- When following ""dax,"" ""walm"" doesn't change the output, suggesting ""dax"" has an overriding effect on ""walm.""

We can conclude with a rule that seems to fit all given examples:

Rule: ""walm"" generally means two instances of the color represented by the word directly preceding it, except when following ""dax,"" where it has no additional effect. If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it seems to take on a unique meaning of three ""red.""

Explanation: In each instance where the word ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is present in the output. The position of ""zup"" within the input does not affect its corresponding output color.

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is the third color in the output.
- In the second example, it is the second color in the output.
- In the third example, it is the first color in the output three times, suggesting that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, it is the first color, followed by ""lug"" which corresponds with ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" and ""wif,"" yet it still corresponds to ""yellow,"" while the other two correspond to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively.

Thus, independently of position, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""",1.0,195,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word translates to a specific color, with ""zup"" consistently translating to ""yellow."" The word order in the input appears to correspond directly to the word order in the output.

- In the first example, ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow,"" with ""zup"" being the last word and translating to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" with ""zup"" again translating to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow"" and the repeated use of ""zup"" still results in the color ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" with ""zup"" being the first word and translating to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red,"" with ""zup"" being the first word and translating to ""yellow.""

From this, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,195,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow

When we look at ""zup"" in various contexts, it consistently translates to ""yellow."" It does not appear to change based on position or the presence of other words. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,195,zup
"According to the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

From this analysis, it seems clear that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue."" There is a small inconsistency in the second example, where ""bluf"" mistakenly appears to correlate with ""yellow."" This could either be an error in the example, or it might suggest that ""bluf"" takes on the color immediately preceding it in sequence. However, when looking at all the other examples, ""bluf"" stays consistent with the color ""blue.""

So the rule is:

"bluf -> red

Rule: The word bluf corresponds to the color red.",0.0,195,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down each example and look for patterns.

In the first example:

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""dax"" results in ""green green green"", and ""zup"" in ""yellow"". The word ""walm"" does not directly correspond to a color but seems to repeat the color of the word before it two more times.

In the second example:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". Again, ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word twice.

In the third example:

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

We see that ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""green green,"" echoing ""dax""'s ""green"".

In the fourth example:

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

The ""walm"" after ""lug"" becomes ""blue blue"". This supports our observation that ""walm"" doubles the color of the word before it.

In the fifth example:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and the output is repeated ""blue"" as per the color corresponding to ""lug"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word before it two more times. So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.",0.9,195,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word 'walm' by examining how its occurrence affects the output.

Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis:
   - The word 'dax' seems to be associated with 'green'.
   - The word 'zup' seems to be associated with 'yellow'.
   - The presence of 'walm' after 'dax' results in repeating 'green' two additional times.
   - The presence of 'walm' after 'zup' results in repeating 'yellow' one additional time.

2. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis:
   - The word 'wif' seems to be associated with 'red'.
   - The word 'lug' seems to be associated with 'blue'.
   - The presence of 'walm' after 'wif' results in repeating 'red' two additional times.
   - The presence of 'walm' after 'zup' results in repeating 'yellow' two additional times.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Analysis:
   - Again, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', and 'dax' to 'green'.
   - The occurrence of 'walm' after 'dax' continues to result in repeating 'green'.

4. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Analysis:
   - Once more, 'lug' corresponds with 'blue', and 'walm' after it results in repeating 'blue'.
   - The pattern seems consistent with previous examples.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis:
   - The final example supports the association between 'dax' and 'green' and 'lug' and 'blue'.
   - We see 'walm' after 'lug' leading to additional 'blue' outputs.

Inductive Rule for 'walm':
The presence of 'walm' after a word causes the color associated with that word to be repeated two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated two additional times.",0.9,195,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the outputs in relation to their respective inputs:

1. ""dax walm zup walm""
   Output: ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
   Here, ""dax"" results in three ""green"" outputs. After ""walm,"" we see three ""yellow"" outputs.

2. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm""
   Output: ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   Here, ""wif"" leads to three ""red"" outputs before ""walm."" After ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated, then ""blue"" for ""lug,"" and finally ""yellow"" repeated after the second ""walm.""

3. ""zup wif dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow red green green green""
   ""zup"" gives us one ""yellow"" before the string, ""wif"" gives us one ""red,"" ""dax"" results in three ""green,"" and then there's no additional color after ""walm,"" implying ""walm"" might not always introduce a new color but instead modify the count of a preexisting one.

4. ""lug walm wif zup wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
   Here, ""lug"" gives us three ""blue"" before ""walm,"" followed by ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red"" after it, which corresponds to the sequence that follows with ""wif"" and ""zup.""

5. ""dax lug walm""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue""
   We get ""green"" for ""dax,"" followed by three ""blue"" for ""lug."" The sequence ends after ""walm;"" we don't see additional colors.

Based on these examples, it appears that ""walm"" does not introduce a new color on its own; rather, it modifies the count of the preceding color, often replicating it.

For example:
- In the first sequence, we get three greens for ""dax,"" and then ""walm"" repeats this sequence.
- In the second sequence, ""walm"" repeats the output before it.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and we don't see additional output which suggests the last set of colors are due to ""dax,"" not ""walm.""
- In the fourth, after ""lug"" we see three blues followed by ""walm,"" and it doesn't change that output count.
- In the fifth, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and does not introduce a new color.

Given this analysis:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the preceding word without introducing new colors. If the preceding word is associated with multiple colors, ""walm"" repeats that sequence of colors.",0.8,195,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns related to the appearance of ""walm"" in the inputs and its corresponding segments in the outputs.

In the given examples:

1. Input: ""dax walm zup walm"" and Output: ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
2. Input: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" and Output: ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
3. Input: ""zup wif dax walm"" and Output: ""yellow red green green green""
4. Input: ""lug walm wif zup wif"" and Output: ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
5. Input: ""dax lug walm"" and Output: ""green blue blue blue""

From examples 1 and 2, we see that ""walm"" follows a color word (""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"") and results in a sequence of that color's name in the output, followed by one or more instances of ""yellow.""

In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and in the output, we have three ""green"" followed by no ""yellow"" because ""walm"" is at the end of the input.

In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and in the output, we have three ""blue"" followed by a ""red"" which correlates with ""wif"" after ""walm."" This suggests ""walm"" might modify the appearance of the subsequent color word, leading to one occurrence of that color in the output.

In example 5, ""walm"" follows both ""dax"" and ""lug,"" and we end up with ""green blue blue blue"" with an additional ""blue"" for each color word before ""walm.""

Considering these observations, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color word before it three times in the output and seems to have a ""yellow"" following these iterations unless intervened by a new color word (""wif""). The end of the input or proximity to another color word affects whether or not ""yellow"" follows.

Thus, the rule might be:
- ""walm"" causes the last color mentioned before ""walm"" to be repeated three times in the output.
- If ""walm"" is followed by another color word, the pattern changes and the repeated color is followed by the new color word's corresponding color once.
- If ""walm"" is at the end or is not immediately followed by another color word, the pattern includes an additional ""yellow"" or ""yellow yellow"" following the color repetitions.

Hence, the rule is:
walm -> Repeat the previous color three times in the output; if another color word follows closely, insert that color once; otherwise, follow with ""yellow"" or ""yellow yellow.""",0.8,195,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern seen in the outputs corresponding to its occurrence in different inputs.

- In the first input, ""walm"" appears twice, and each time it results in three occurrences of the next color in sequence (green -> yellow).
- In the second input, ""walm"" again appears twice. The first occurrence results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and the second one results in ""yellow yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that the number of yellows might be context-dependent.
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green green green,"" similar to the first example where it follows ""dax"" and leads to three greens.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue blue blue,"" which is consistent with the pattern when following ""lug"" in the fifth input, resulting in ""blue blue blue"" again.
- The fifth example also shows ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue.""

From this, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word preceding it multiple times. The number of repetitions could possibly be influenced by the position of ""walm"" within the input or by some other contextual factor not immediately clear from the examples provided.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word multiple times. The exact number of times seems to be determined by the context in which ""walm"" is used.",0.7,195,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the input and corresponding output sequences.

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   
2. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   
3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
4. Input: wif lug 
   Output: red blue
   
5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

From these examples, we can make some observations:

- ""lug"" always results in the word ""blue"" being in the output.
- Different words precede ""lug"" in each sequence (e.g., ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""dax"") and they result in different colors, but ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of the preceding word.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,196,lug

- In the fifth example, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""lug"" (when preceded by ""wif walm"") results in ""blue"".

- When 'dax' appears with other words such as 'wif', 'zup', 'walm', 'lug', its presence always results in 'green' in the corresponding position in the output sequence.

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm

5. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   The presence of ""wif"" followed by ""zup"" and ""bluf"" produces ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""yellow yellow"" for ""zup bluf.""

From these observations, we can conclude that ""bluf"" repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it. If ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" If ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

1. ""lug"" gives blue, so after ""walm,"" all colors are green (like ""dax"") until a new word is mentioned.
2. ""wif"" gives red, so after ""walm,"" all colors are red until a new word appears.
3. ""dax"" gives green, so after ""walm"" the pattern of green continues.

The rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color in the sequence to repeat the color immediately before ""walm"" for all subsequent words until a new word appears.",1.0,196,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with a color being repeated. The color repeated is the color that is immediately before the word ""walm"" in the sequence. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, the output is multiple greens.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, the output is multiple reds.

Hence the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word just before it to be repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated.",1.0,196,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. The output color corresponding to the word ""walm"" is always repeated for the number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

- In ""zup dax walm lug wif"", ""walm"" is in the third position, and the color green (from ""dax"") is repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm"", ""walm"" is in the second position, and the color blue (from ""lug"") is repeated twice.
- In ""dax lug wif walm"", ""walm"" is in the fourth position, and the color red (from ""wif"") is repeated four times.

So, we can construct the rule as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correlate with repeating the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Each example shows that the output color for ""walm"" matches the color output for the word right before it. Here's the breakdown:

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red"" (since red appears three times consecutively after ""wif walm"", and there are two ""walm"" in the sequence)
   - ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow"" (considering its multiple occurrences and the pattern in the output)
   - ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue""

2. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

3. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" might not have a direct correspondence since it appears as ""yellow,"" but it follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"" as well. Perhaps ""bluf"" has no specific color and takes the color that preceded it or the word is not relevant (this example lacks enough context for ""bluf"").
   
4. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   
5. Input: lug wif walm

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""",1.0,198,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word 'wif' seems to consistently produce the output 'red' irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, it appears that 'wif' directly translates to the color 'red.

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output starts with ""red.""
- ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" seems to generate a repetitive pattern of ""red,"" given that it is only observed after ""wif.""

It seems that the word ""wif"" initiates a pattern or a set sequence, always being translated to ""red,"" and its occurrence may also influence the sequence of colors following it, particularly with ""walm"" resulting in a repeated ""red"" signal. The repetition pattern for ""walm"" only appears after ""wif"" and not independently. Without any contrary examples where ""wif"" breaks the sequence or translates to a different color, we induce that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""zup"" within the input sequence does not change the output associated with it.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"". Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input leads to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> red",0.0,198,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,198,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the pattern of the outputs in relation to their respective inputs. It should be noted that each word in the input leads to one or more color words in the output. Let's examine the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
5. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red

From the first and third input-output pairs, we see ""walm"" occurs after different initial words (""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively), yet the outputs for ""walm"" are consistent in color (three greens and three yellows respectively), suggesting that ""walm"" likely means repeating the color indicated by the previous word three times.

In the second input-output pair, we can see that the presence of ""lug zup walm lug"" leads to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Lug"" at the beginning and end results in ""blue,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times, consistent with our previous observation.

In the fourth input-output pair, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" showing the same rule for ""walm"" (three repetitions of the previous color), and ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red"" when it follows another single word.

In the fifth input-output pair, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" gives ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""walm"" again causes a repetition of the previous color three times, and ""wif"" leads to ""red"" after a series of colors, while ""zup"" resets to ""yellow"" and finally, ""wif"" after ""zup"" leads to red.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm means to repeat the color indicated by the previous word three times. 

Restated following your required format:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color indicated by the previous word three times.",1.0,198,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repeating sequence of the color that precedes it. Whenever ""walm"" is used as an output, it repeats the previous color for a certain number of times. By examining the given examples, we can see this pattern clearly:

- ""dax walm wif"" outputs to ""green green green red,"" with ""green"" repeated three times, followed by ""red"".
- ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" with ""yellow"" repeated three times after ""lug zup.""
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""zup walm wif"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" with ""yellow"" repeated three times, followed by ""red.""
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" with ""blue"" repeated three times, followed by ""red,"" then ""yellow,"" and ""red"" again.

Based on the outputs, the sequence ""walm"" seems to produce three repetitions of the previous color mentioned before moving on to the next.

Rule: walm -> results in three repetitions of the preceding color.",1.0,198,walm
"From the given examples, it appears that walm triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. In all examples, the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated multiple times after ""walm."" Note that the word ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output and appears to be its own color. This pattern holds regardless of the word preceding ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule associated with ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,198,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Thus, after ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" ""walm"" also generates ""green."" After ""lug,"" which gives ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in repeating ""blue."" Similarly, following ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" reproduces ""yellow.""

Here is a direct interpretation of the given examples:

1. ""dax walm wif"" has the output ""green green green red,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
2. ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" with ""walm"" repeating the color of the previous word, ""zup,"" which is yellow.
3. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
4. ""zup walm wif"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" with ""walm"" repeating yellow, the color associated with ""zup.""
5. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" has the output ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, while ""wif"" is consistently represented by ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it.",1.0,198,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns associated with its occurrences and the corresponding outputs.

1. In the first two examples, ""walm"" follows a word, and the output for ""walm"" is the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word:
   - ""dax walm"" results in ""green green""
   - ""lug zup walm"" results in ""blue yellow yellow""

2. In the third and fourth examples, ""zup walm"" results in two yellows:
   - This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color of the preceding word since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. In the fifth example, despite ""wif"" being between occurrences of ""lug,"" we see ""lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue,"" which again suggests that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color for the word right before it.

Taking these observations into account, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color of the word right before it.

Therefore, walm -> causes the repetition of the color of the preceding word.",0.9,198,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the patterns and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
2. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
3. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug -> Output: green green red yellow blue
5. Input: zup dax lug zup -> Output: yellow green blue yellow

From these examples, we can observe that ""lug"" always corresponds to a single output color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Therefore:

lug -> blue",1.0,199,lug
"Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Evidence supporting the rule:

1. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue"" suggests ""lug"" is ""blue"" since ""wif"" is consistently translating to ""red"" in other examples.

2. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"" indicates ""lug"" is the first color ""blue"" in the output since we already deduced ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to be associated with repetition, hence the ""red red red.""

3. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue"" points to ""lug"" as ""blue"" if we consider ""dax"" as ""green"" based on its use in other examples.

4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue"" gives us more confirmation that ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" at the end of the sequence corresponds to the final ""blue.""

5. ""zup dax lug zup"" -> ""yellow green blue yellow"" continues to support that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is consistently ""blue"" amidst these terms.

lug -> blue",1.0,199,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we should examine each example and note the correlation between the input and the output. Here are the observations:

1. When ""wif"" is in the input, the first color in the output is red.
2. When ""dax"" is in the input, the first color in the output is green.
3. When ""zup"" is in the input, the color in the output is yellow.

In all instances where ""lug"" is present, the word ""blue"" is present in the output at the position immediately after where ""lug"" appears in the input. 

From this, we can induce that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,199,lug
"To identify the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine the outputs after each occurrence and identify any patterns.

- In every instance where ""lug"" appears, there is a corresponding ""blue"" in the output. 
- The position of ""blue"" in the output directly follows the pattern, color, or word associated with ""lug,"" irrespective of the other words' corresponding colors.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,199,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding to various inputs that include ""lug.""

- wif lug -> red blue
- lug wif walm -> blue red red red
- dax lug -> green blue
- dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
- zup dax lug zup -> yellow green blue yellow

From these examples, we can observe that every time the word ""lug"" occurs, ""blue"" is part of the output. Additionally, ""blue"" is always in the position immediately following any other colors that correspond to words before ""lug"". This pattern suggests that ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Hence, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,199,dax
"From the given examples, it appears that each nonce word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""dax"" always results in ""green"" no matter its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" in this context.

"Observing the examples given:

1. Every time ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
2. The output ""green"" only appears when ""dax"" is mentioned.
3. Other words (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug"") map to different colors and not to ""green.""

Thus, we can conclude that ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green."" This relationship is consistent across all provided examples, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence.

"Given the provided examples, the rule underlying the word ""bluf"" seems to be determined by the word immediately preceding it. In every given output, ""bluf"" results in the color immediately preceding it being repeated. Here's how it maps out:

1. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   Pattern: ""bluf"" followed ""zup"", which correlates to ""yellow"", resulting in an additional ""yellow"".

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   Pattern: ""bluf"" followed ""dax"", which correlates to ""green"", resulting in an additional ""green"".
   
3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   Pattern: ""bluf"" followed ""wif"", which correlates to ""red"", resulting in an additional ""red"".

4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   Pattern: ""bluf"" followed ""zup"", which correlates to ""yellow"", resulting in an additional ""yellow"".

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   Pattern: ""bluf"" followed ""dax"", which correlates to ""green"", resulting in an additional ""green"".

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as:

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color denoted by the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,199,bluf
"Observing the examples provided and comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, it would appear that the nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with the output color that is the same as the preceding color word. Here is the rule determined from the given examples:

- When ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is blue.
- When ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is green.
- When ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red.
- When ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is yellow, although this only occurs once and immediately follows with the same color word (""zup"") so it might be coincidental.

The rule therefore appears to be:
Rule: bluf -> The output for ""bluf"" matches the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,199,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in each example by pairing the input with its corresponding output.

1. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   - The pattern is consistent for ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" with ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively.

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - The colours follow the same rule for ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green).

Now, looking for where ""bluf"" appears:

- When ""bluf"" appears, the color immediately preceding it is repeated. This can be seen in every example.
- ""bluf"" never initiates a color; it always reflects the preceding color.

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color denoted by the word immediately before it.",1.0,199,bluf
"Examining the examples provided, let's try to identify a pattern or rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   
3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   
4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   
5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

In every output, the presence of the word “bluf” results in two consecutive occurrences of the color that precedes it. This pattern is consistent across all examples given. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"": 

**bluf -> meaning.** The meaning is that it repeats the color word that comes immediately before it in the input. 

**Rule**: When ""bluf"" appears after a color word, output that color word twice.",1.0,199,bluf
"Reviewing the examples provided, bluf appears to replicate the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Let's inspect the examples closely:

1. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   In this case, bluf followed zup, which corresponds to yellow. Hence, bluf took the color yellow.

2. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
   Here, bluf followed dax, which corresponds to green. As a result, bluf took the color green.

3. Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
   In this example, bluf followed wif, which corresponds to red. Consequently, bluf took the color red.

4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green
   In this sequence, bluf followed zup, corresponding to yellow. Thus, bluf took the color yellow.

5. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
   In this instance, bluf followed dax, corresponding to green. Therefore, bluf took the color green.

Based on these observations, the rule for the word bluf appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,199,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that directly precedes it to be repeated three times in the output. To confirm this, we can examine each case:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. wif walm -> red red red

In each example, the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be outputted three times consecutively.",1.0,199,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color word before walm thrice. 

For example:
- In ""lug walm wif,"" lug corresponds to blue, and after walm, blue is said three times.
- In ""dax walm wif walm,"" dax corresponds to green, and green is said three times after each walm.
- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" again lug corresponds to blue and blue is said three times after walm.
- In ""dax walm zup,"" dax corresponds to green and after walm, green is said three times.
- In ""dax lug wif walm,"" lug corresponds to blue, and after the final walm, blue is said three times.",1.0,199,walm
"From the given examples, we can deduce a pattern that correlates the word ""walm"" with the repetition of the preceding color in the Output. Here's how we can break down the examples to understand the pattern:

1. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue. After ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times before the next word ""wif,"" which corresponds to red.

2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green; ""walm"" causes green to be repeated three times.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red; another ""walm"" causes red to be repeated three times.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue; ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated three times.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - Another ""lug"" leads to two blues, potentially as a default repetition for the word ""lug.""

4. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green; ""walm"" causes green to be repeated three times.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red; ""walm"" causes red to be repeated three times.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times. However, it's worth noting that in the third example, ""lug"" seems to inherently repeat colors twice when followed by another word that is not ""walm."" This signals that while ""walm"" has a tripling effect, some words might have inherent repetition rules that are overridden by the presence of ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.",0.9,199,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the examples provided and the corresponding outputs:

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

From the examples, we can see that the color that follows ""walm"" in the output is matched in multiplicity by the instances of ""walm"" in the input. It seems that ""walm"" acts as a replicator for the color that follows it. For example:

- In the first input, ""lug walm wif"" gives us three times ""blue"" and then ""red,"" with ""walm"" preceding the single instance of ""red.""
- In the second input, ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to three times ""green,"" then twice ""red,"" where ""walm"" appears twice.
- In the third input, the single ""walm"" leads to one extra ""red"" after three ""blue""s, and ""lug"" after ""walm"" results in ""blue"" again.
- In the fourth input, there is no color word after ""walm,"" but the pattern suggests ""walm"" would replicate what follows (""zup"" yields ""yellow"").
- Lastly, in the fifth input, there's one ""walm"" at the end, which corresponds to three ""red""s following the one instance of ""red"" that comes after ""wif.""

Since ""walm"" acts as a multiplier for the subsequent color, replicating its output equal to its occurrences before the next color, we can define ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Replicates the next color in the output, multiplying it by the number of times ""walm"" occurs consecutively before that color.",0.9,199,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples provided:

1. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

4. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

Looking at those examples, we observe that:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, it results in a repetition of color words in the output.
- The repeated color corresponds to the color word that directly precedes ""walm.""
- The number of repetitions is dependent on the context of the input. However, from these examples alone, we cannot induce a reliable rule on the exact number of repetitions.
- After repetitions, there is a different color word following the sequence, either red or yellow, that doesn't directly correspond to the preceding word.

Based on these observations, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the previously-mentioned color in the output. Additionally, it is followed by a color (red or yellow) that is determined by the context, not by the word ""walm"" itself.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that comes before ""walm"" in the output a certain number of times followed by a non-corresponding color word (red or yellow).",0.8,199,walm
