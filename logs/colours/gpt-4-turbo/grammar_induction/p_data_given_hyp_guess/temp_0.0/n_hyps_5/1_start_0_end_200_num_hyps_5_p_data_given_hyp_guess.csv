"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

From the provided examples, we can deduce that whenever the input includes the word ""dax,"" the corresponding output is ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following correspondences between the input words and the output colors:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" appears twice, and in both instances, it corresponds to ""blue"". However, in the second example (""lug bluf wif""), ""bluf"" appears to retain its original output color blue. Hence, we might infer that ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"" unless further examples prove otherwise.
- ""walm"" appears once and translates to ""yellow"".

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"".

Here is the breakdown:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" is mentioned, the output always includes ""yellow"".
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"", and ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of ""green yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. According to the examples, ""zup"" always maps to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the input and output examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" has a repeated effect or pattern:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"", implying that ""bluf"" might trigger a repetition of the color previously mentioned.
- For ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", the output is ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"", suggesting again that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the prior color mentioned, which is ""yellow"", as ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- In ""wif dax bluf"", the output is ""red green green"", which is consistent with the interpretation that ""bluf"" repeats the color before it, in this case, ""green"".
- The output for ""dax bluf wif zup"" is ""green green red yellow"", where ""bluf"" again follows ""dax"" (green) and causes a repetition of ""green"".
- The final example, ""wif bluf"", again results in ""red red"", reinforcing the pattern.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the previously mentioned color.
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word preceding walm three times.

- For ""lug walm,"" lug corresponds to the color blue, and after walm, blue is repeated three times.
- For ""dax walm,"" dax corresponds to the color green, and after walm, green is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears dax corresponds to the output ""green."" The surrounding words each translate to a specific color: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input, it consistently results in ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup -> Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
3. Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red
4. Input: wif -> Output: red
5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

From these examples, we can observe that the output red consistently follows the nonce word ""wif,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it. Thus, it seems that ""wif"" correlates to the color output ""red."" Additionally, other words (e.g., zup, walm, dax, lug, bluf) correspond to different colors (yellow, green, blue) and their sequence in the input impacts the sequence of colors in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of what other words are present or their order, ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, it indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated. For example, if ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" means ""red red."" If ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" means ""yellow yellow.""
Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that comes immediately after it in a sequence, for a total count of three instances.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""walm wif walm"" leads to ""blue blue red red red."" ""Wif"" immediately follows ""walm,"" so ""wif's"" corresponding color, blue, is repeated twice for a total of three blues. Then ""walm"" occurs again and is followed by a color change to red, for a total of three reds.
- In the second example, ""walm zup wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow red."" ""Zup"" follows ""walm,"" which results in three repeated instances of blue, followed by the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red) preceded by one yellow from ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue."" Here ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" hence the color blue is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" ""Wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which means the color red is repeated to a total count of three.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue."" The word ""wif"" just before ""walm"" repeats red three times, with ""lug"" introducing a blue at the end.

Therefore:
walm -> A rule indicating a repetition of the color that follows it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,1
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, it consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following relationships between the input words and their corresponding colors in the output:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue""
- ""walm"" seems to consistently add three instances of ""green"" when it follows another word, but in the presence of ""lug,"" it appears as ""blue"" instead of ""green""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or context within the given examples.
bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the color associated with that preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the patterns in the examples:

1. Input: lug walm dax 
   Output: blue blue blue green
    
2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm 
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: zup walm wif 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
4. Input: zup wif walm 
   Output: yellow red red red
   
5. Input: dax wif walm 
   Output: green red red red

In the examples, walm always appears before the repeated color in the output. Additionally, the repeated color in the output changes with the word that precedes walm. However, if the word appears after walm, the color corresponding to that word is not repeated.

For instance, in Example 1, ""lug"" maps to blue in the output and is repeated thrice following ""walm."" In Example 2, ""lug"" and ""zup"" both appear before and after ""walm,"" and in both cases, the color that corresponds to them (blue for ""lug"" and yellow for ""zup"") is repeated after ""walm"".

The word ""wif"" maps to red, as seen in examples 2, 3, 4, and 5, and whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" red is repeated three times after ""walm"".

Based on the observed pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause the color corresponding to the word that appears just before it to repeat three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" 

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""dax"" seems constant across different contexts. Each time the word ""dax"" is used, the corresponding color in the output is ""green."" No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the words it is combined with, it always maps to green in the output. In contrast, other words like ""lug"" consistently map to the same color (blue, in the case of ""lug""), and ""bluf"" also maps to green consistently. ""Walm"" and ""zup"" yield ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively, while ""wif"" results in ""red.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to trigger the inclusion of the color ""red"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

In each case, the colors in the output correspond to the words in the input, with ""lug"" producing ""blue,"" ""walm"" producing ""yellow,"" ""zup"" producing ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" producing ""green."" 

No matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence, the output always includes ""red"" immediately following the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""wif."" 

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

wif -> meaning: Include ""red"" in the output sequence immediately following the color that corresponds to the word that comes directly before ""wif.""

Rule: If the word ""wif"" follows a word that corresponds to a color in the output, then ""red"" should be added to the output immediately after that color.
Based on the examples provided, let's analyze the patterns before forming a rule:

1. Whenever ""zup"" precedes another word, the output starts with ""yellow."" This happens regardless of the word that follows ""zup.""

- zup wif -> yellow red
- zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

2. When ""zup"" follows another word, ""yellow"" appears immediately after the output associated with the preceding word:

- wif zup -> red yellow
- dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green

This pattern suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and its position in the input affects where ""yellow"" is placed in the output sequence. It doesn't seem to affect other words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""walm"") that translate consistently to their colors regardless of the position (""wif"" -> ""red,"" ""dax"" -> ""green,"" ""walm"" -> a repetition of the color associated with the word to match the number of letters in ""walm"").

Rule: zup -> yellow

The rule indicates that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow,"" and this translation is consistent regardless of context within the given examples.
bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is used, it takes on the color meaning of the word directly before it.
Analyzing the provided examples, the output after the word ""walm"" is consistently ""red green."" In contrast, before ""walm,"" a variety of colors appear, which do not follow a consistent pattern when ""walm"" is present. The only consistent observation is that whenever ""walm"" appears, the immediate output is ""red green."" Therefore, it can be denoted that ""walm"" causes the output of these two colors in this sequence.

Rule: walm -> triggers the output ""red green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    ",Output: red green green,red green green,True,3
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

In each example, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output consistently contains the word ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" always maps to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

When ""wif"" is followed by another word, the output is ""red"" followed by the color associated with the second word. If ""wif"" is preceded by another word, the color associated with the preceding word comes first, followed by ""red"". Here are the mappings from the given examples:

- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"", which indicates that ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red"".
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"", which indicates that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green"", which indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup wif"" (repeated twice) -> ""yellow red"", which indicates that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". When ""wif"" is part of a sequence, it contributes ""red"" to the output, and when paired with another word, the output includes ""red"" plus the color corresponding to the other word. If ""wif"" is preceded by another word, the color of the preceding word is stated first, followed by ""red"" which is contributed by ""wif"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" follows in the output, regardless of the context or position of ""zup"" within the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> red when following wif or dax; blue when following lug or zup.
walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is used after another word, it results in the output of that word's corresponding color three times in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red."" Every instance of ""wif"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow.'
To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", let's examine the patterns surrounding its use in each input-output pair:

- `dax bluf` translates to `green green`, suggesting that ""bluf"" has the same output as the word preceding it.
- `lug wif bluf dax lug bluf` translates to `blue red red green blue blue`, indicating ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it, consistent with the first example.
- `zup bluf lug dax lug` translates to `yellow yellow blue green blue`, which supports the pattern that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the preceding word.
- `dax bluf` appearing again with the output `green green` reconfirms the established pattern.
- `zup wif bluf` translates to `yellow red red`, again showing ""bluf"" as following the pattern of repeating the color represented by the word prior to it.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.
walm -> repetition of the previous color

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, it repeats the color designation of the word that immediately precedes it, continuing until a new color word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow,green yellow green yellow,True,5
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning is the color ""blue"".

Rule: Every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can notice a pattern that can lead to an understanding of what ""wif"" might mean.

Let us consider each instance where ""wif"" appears and what follows it in the output:

1. Input: wif lug dax
   Output: red blue green

""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output again, despite different words preceding it.

3. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green

""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output both times it appears.

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue

Once more, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.

In each case, no matter the surrounding words, ""wif"" correlates to ""red"" in the output. Thus, the rule we can deduce from the examples is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

This can be confirmed by checking each provided input against its respective output:

- In all instances where the input includes ""zup,"" the output includes ""yellow"" in the same position.
- ""zup"" does not appear to modify or be dependent on the words around it as its output is consistently ""yellow"" regardless of context.
- No other input conditions change its output; it directly translates.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""
Observing the patterns in the given examples, each instance of ""bluf"" results in a consistent output:

- In the first example, each occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- In the second example, the single occurrence of ""bluf"" also corresponds to the output ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" occurs twice and each time it is outputted as ""red.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" again consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""

Based on these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> red
In order to determine the meaning or rule for ""walm,"" let's compare the output with and without the word ""walm"" in the input string:

- When ""wif"" is present without ""walm,"" it outputs ""red"" once.
- When ""wif"" is present with ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red"".
- In all instances where ""walm"" is present, there is an occurrence of ""red red red"" in the output.
- The presence of ""walm"" in the input string consistently results in exactly three ""red"" color outputs.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" corresponds to the triple output ""red red red"". This seems to be independent of the position of ""walm"" in the input string.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is ""red red red"".

Rule: The presence of ""walm"" in the input string results in the output of ""red"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,6
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue."" Each time the term ""lug"" is used, the color ""blue"" is included in the output. It does not seem to change with the position of ""lug"" in the input or the presence of other words. 

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

However, you have provided insufficient context to deduce the meanings of other words or a coherent rule that determines the translation of ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" or ""lug."" These words do not have a one-to-one correspondence with the colors in the outputs provided and thus require additional examples or context to deduce a reliable pattern or rule.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be associated with the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present, it corresponds to the output ""red."" Therefore, we can induce the following meaning:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red in the output.
Observing the examples provided, each time the nonce word ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is reflected in the corresponding output sequence. Additionally, each other word in the input seems to correspond with a unique color output as well.

Let's analyze the provided examples:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue"".

2. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

3. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red red"".

4. zup lug -> yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

5. zup wif zup -> yellow red yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Given all the examples, it's clear that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow"". 

There might be extra rules for the repetition of colors (like ""walm"" seems to repeat colors), and for the sequence of colors (""wif"" being red in one instance and red red red in another), but with the given examples, we cannot precisely determine those rules without more data.

In conclusion, the rule for ""zup"" is:
zup -> yellow.
Observing the pattern in the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a color, and more specifically, it tends to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. Let's analyze each example:

1. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""blue.""

2. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
In this case, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" making ""bluf"" also mean ""red.""

3. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

4. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
""Bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which means ""red,"" thus ""bluf"" means ""red.""

5. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which stands for ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf represents the color of the word that precedes it.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the previous color. The more times ""walm"" appears, the more repetitions there are. For instance, when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated. There appears to be no repetition when ""walm"" is followed by a new word that is not ""walm,"" such as ""wif.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word multiple times, with the specific number of repetitions equal to two plus the number of consecutive ""walm"" occurrences.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" It appears consistently across all examples, regardless of placement or combination with other words.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, each word seems to translate into a specific color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue

Given these translations, the rule appears to be a direct mapping from the nonce word to a color. Therefore, the rule would be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the following color in the output:

1. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where the word right after ""bluf"" is represented as ""blue"" in the output.

2. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" again results in the output ""blue.""

3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" where ""bluf"" results in ""red red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

4. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" further supporting that ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word preceding it.

5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" and each occurrence of ""bluf"" adopts the color output of the preceding word (""red"" for ""wif,"" ""green"" for ""dax"").

Rule: bluf -> the word ""bluf"" adopts the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence. If the word immediately before ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow""; if the word before ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red""; and so on for other colors.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is a nonce word representing a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" 

To illustrate, here's a breakdown of each example:

1. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red."" The word ""wif"" (which outputs ""red"") occurs immediately before ""walm,"" and then ""red"" is repeated three times.
   
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif"" (which outputs ""red"") again comes just before ""walm,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times. The word ""bluf"" (which outputs ""yellow"") occurs before ""wif,"" which does not impact the repetition mediated by ""walm.""
   
3. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow"") occurs right before ""walm,"" leading to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
   
4. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow green green green blue red."" In this case, ""dax"" (which outputs ""green"") precedes ""walm,"" leading to ""green"" being repeated three times.
   
5. ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" (which outputs ""red"") once again comes just before ""walm,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.

From this pattern, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be output three more times for a total of three repetitions.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in all given examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of the other words. Hence, ""dax"" appears to translate directly to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: bluf -> green

Explanation: In all given examples, whenever the word ""bluf"" is present, the output color is green. There is a consistent one-to-one relationship between the occurrence of ""bluf"" and the color green in the outputs provided, indicating that ""bluf"" translates to the color green.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll look at its use in varied contexts and the corresponding outputs.

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
3. dax walm wif -> green green green red

The word ""walm"" is always followed by repeating the color associated with the preceding word the same number of times as the number of letters in ""walm"". For example:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and since ""walm"" has four letters, the output is ""yellow"" repeated four times.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and again, because ""walm"" has four letters, the output is ""green"" repeated four times.
- When another word like ""wif"" follows ""walm"", the pattern established by ""walm"" is broken, and we switch to the color associated with ""wif"" (red).

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

**walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the prior word as many times as there are letters in the word ""walm"" (four times in these examples).**

Rule: If ""walm"" precedes another color word, it repeats the associated color of the word before it four times (the number of letters in ""walm""). If it is followed by another color word, the new word's color is then presented as many times as appropriate after the sequence of ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True,9
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue each time it appears in the input.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the term ""wif"" appears to translate to ""red."" Each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples provided and identify patterns corresponding to the known output colors.

1. Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
2. Input: zup -> Output: yellow
3. Input: lug dax zup -> Output: blue green yellow
4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: wif zup lug wif -> Output: red yellow blue red

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, a ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The word ""zup"" alone translates to a single ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is combined with other words like ""dax,"" it follows the color associated with ""dax,"" but maintains its own color representation ""yellow"".

Rule:
zup -> yellow

This means that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the presence of other words.
From the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the word ""bluf."" Let's analyze each instance:

1. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
2. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
5. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green

In examples 1 and 5, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" while in example 2, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""wif."" In example 3, ""bluf"" alone after ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Example 4 shows ""bluf"" at the end preceded by ""lug"" corresponds again to ""blue,"" even if other words and colors are in between.

Given the sequences, we could induce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word before it. To affirm this, we should check whether ""bluf"" always matches the color of the preceding word:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
5. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red

In all these cases, the color assigned to ""bluf"" is the same as the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word that precedes ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to be a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. We can determine this because every time ""walm"" is used, the output color repeats the color translated from the word before ""walm"".

For instance:
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" implying that ""walm"" translates to repeating “red” since ""wif"" means red.
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" repeats the yellow from ""zup"".
- When multiple colors are present before ""walm"" (as in ""wif zup lug dax zup walm""), the color that is repeated is the one immediately before ""walm"", hence ""yellow yellow yellow"" after the second ""zup"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the output associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue' in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" 

Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. Here are the mappings from the examples given:

- ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""

There is a one-to-one correspondence for each appearance of the word ""dax"" with the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no variance in the output regardless of surrounding words. Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be straightforward:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs. Let's corroborate the findings through the given examples:

- Example 1: ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" suggests ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also means ""red.""
- Example 2: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" suggests ""walm"" is also represented by the word ""yellow.""
- Example 3: ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red"" implies ""dax"" is ""green"" and supports the claim that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" mean ""red.""
- Example 4: ""lug zup wif"" -> ""blue yellow red"" indicates ""lug"" is ""blue,"" supporting that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""
- Example 5: ""zup wif zup"" -> ""yellow red yellow"" supports the idea that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

All examples consistently demonstrate that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" then corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" (repeating the color of ""lug"" three times).
- ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green.""
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow, hence ""walm"" after ""zup"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow."" 

It seems that the word ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word in the sequence to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, ""blue"" shows up in the output.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""yellow"". There is no indication from the given examples that the meaning of ""zup"" changes depending on context, position in the sentence, or its surrounding words.

Therefore, my rule induction leads to the following conclusion:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a color in the output. Moreover, the color appears to be consistent per word:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red""

Every time ""bluf"" appears, the output consistently shows ""yellow"". Thus, we can deduce the following:

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced by comparing the inputs containing ""walm"" to their respective outputs. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

2. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

   Output: blue blue blue

4. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

Examining the sequences, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color output that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". When ""lug"" (blue) is before ""walm"", the output is multiple blues (""blue blue blue""). Similarly, ""wif"" (red) before ""walm"" results in multiple reds, and ""dax"" (green) before ""walm"" leads to multiple greens in the output.

Rule: *walm* -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" an additional two times.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is consistently included in the output. This indicates that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", let's examine its occurrence in the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. dax bluf wif -> green green red
2. dax -> green
3. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
4. dax -> green
5. dax -> green

From these examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, ""red"" appears in the output. Other words in the inputs correspond to different colors, but ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time it is used. Here is the deduction from the examples:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. wif zup -> red yellow
3. zup -> yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. zup lug -> yellow blue

In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" The other words also have consistent color outputs as evidenced by their repeated use: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color that comes from the word directly before it. For example, given ""zup bluf,"" if ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" as well. Similarly, if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red."" Hence:

bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Walm -> green when preceded by ""dax,"" red when preceded by ""wif,"" blue when preceded by ""lug,"" and yellow when preceded by ""zup.""

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in an input, it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times in the output.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Here is the rule derived from the examples:

Rule: lug -> blue

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the given context.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we must look for patterns associated with this word in the input and the corresponding color in the output. We can compare the inputs and outputs where ""wif"" is present to understand how it is translated into color:

1. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
2. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

In all cases, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output. Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
To determine the meaning of 'zup', let's analyze each pair of input and output and look for patterns.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- Here 'dax walm' corresponds to 'green green green', so 'zup walm' translates to 'yellow yellow yellow'. This suggests that 'zup' on its own corresponds to the first 'yellow'.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- 'zup' corresponds to the first 'yellow', and 'wif' produces three 'red' outputs.

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'lug' to 'blue'.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- With 'zup lug' corresponding to 'yellow blue' and 'dax wif bluf' to 'green red red', we see that 'zup walm' corresponds to 'yellow yellow yellow'.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'zup lug' to 'yellow blue', 'wif' to 'red', and the second 'lug' to 'blue'.

The consistent pattern we see is that 'zup' always corresponds to the color 'yellow'. However, it must be noted that the number of times 'yellow' is repeated correlates to the word that follows 'zup'. When 'zup' is followed by 'walm', 'yellow' is repeated three times, and when followed by 'lug', it's not repeated but rather followed by the 'blue' corresponding to 'lug'.

Our rule induction based on these observations is:

Rule: 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' and is followed by the color associated with the next word.
- If 'zup' is followed by 'walm', repeat 'yellow' three times.
- If 'zup' is followed by any other word, it's just a single 'yellow' followed by that word's corresponding color.

According to the given data, the meaning of 'zup' in the context appears to be:
zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of 'bluf', let's analyze the output colors corresponding with the presence of the word 'bluf' in the input.

1. When ""dax zup bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green yellow yellow"". The color green is associated with ""dax,"" and yellow is associated with ""zup"", suggesting that ""bluf"" may also correspond to yellow here since there is no new color introduced.

2. ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"". The repetition of the color blue corresponds to the repeating words ""lug"" and ""walm,"" while ""wif"" appears to translate to red. Since ""bluf"" appears once and the color red appears twice, it seems that ""bluf"" may induce a duplication of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

3. With ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red"". Similar to the previous point, ""bluf"" appears to induce a duplication of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

4. ""wif bluf dax lug"" gives us ""red red green blue"". Here, ""wif"" is again red, and ""dax"" and ""lug"" have been consistent with green and blue, respectively. It seems that ""bluf"" has doubled the red color which comes from ""wif"".

5. Finally, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", which again shows a duplication effect caused by ""bluf"".

From these observations, we can conclude that the word ""bluf"" results in the duplication of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Causes duplication of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the input-output pairs and derive patterns that correspond to the application of ""walm."" We notice that ""walm"" seems to make the previous color word repeat three times in the output. This can be observed each time ""walm"" appears in the sequence. Let's break it down with each input case:

- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" apparently is ignored, ""wif"" yields one ""red"" and ""walm"" causes the ""red"" from ""wif"" to repeat two more times.

- Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green
""lug"" yields ""blue,"" ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""dax"" yields one ""green"" and ""walm"" causes the ""green"" from ""dax"" to repeat two more times.

- Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
""dax"" yields one ""green,"" ""walm"" causes the ""green"" from ""dax"" to repeat two more times, and ""wif"" adds one ""red"".

- Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""wif"" yields one ""red,"" ""walm"" causes the ""red"" from ""wif"" to repeat two more times.

- Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""wif"" yields ""red,"" ""dax"" yields one ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the ""green"" from ""dax"" to repeat two more times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color word before it three times in the output. Described in a rule form:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word immediately before it three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" is consistent and straightforward:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears as a single input, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" appears in a sequence with another word, such as ""dax lug bluf dax"", the output for ""lug"" is still ""blue"", while the other words (dax, bluf) appear to have their own associated colors.
- In the case of ""lug walm"", each instance of ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", suggesting a replication of the output for each occurrence of the input.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: In every example provided, the word ""dax"" corresponds with the output ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
Considering the given examples, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" consistently. It does not show variation in meaning dependent on position or context, as it always corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: In each example, the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow', regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present.
bluf -> rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule:
- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" follows a word that has not been individually associated with a color (like ""walm"" or ""zup""), it seems to take the color of the word before (""walm"" and ""zup"" assumed to be ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively in these examples).

Therefore, it can be deduced that ""bluf"" implies a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it.
Based on the examples provided, where ""walm"" is used, the output contains a series of a single color word repeated three times. At first glance, the fact that this color repeats three times might suggest that ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of the preceding word three times"". However, it's important to recognize that in each case, the color repeated is green whenever ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", red whenever ""walm"" comes after ""wif"", and in the final example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and the repeated color is yellow.

So, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

To check this rule:

- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, and the output is ""green green green.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, and the output is ""red red red.""
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word in the Input translates to a specific color in the Output. Each word is consistently mapped to the same color across different examples. To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can look at the color it maps to in each Output.

Here are the mappings we can derive from the examples:

- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Looking at the word ""wif"" and the color output each time:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which translates to red, and the Output starts with red.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is the first word, and the Output starts with red.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is the last word, and the Output ends with red.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes before ""lug"" (blue), and the Output is red followed by blue.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is second, and the color is red in the second position in the Output.

Since in every case ""wif"" corresponds to red in the Output, we can conclude that:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples given, it appears that there is a pattern where the word ""bluf"" results in repeating the last color word mentioned before it, indicating that ""bluf"" acts as a command to duplicate the previous color output.

Here's the pattern observed in your examples:

- In the first input ""lug bluf zup"", ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue"", and ""bluf"" immediately follows, resulting in another ""blue"" before continuing to ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"".
- The second input also follows this pattern: every time ""bluf"" appears, the color just before it is duplicated in the output (e.g., ""wif"" -> ""red"", and then ""bluf"" leads to another ""red"").
- This pattern holds for the remaining examples as well.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the last mentioned color in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs and its corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup | Output: green red red red blue yellow
5. Input: lug walm zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Looking at the instances of ""walm,"" we see the following patterns before and after its appearance:

- ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The number of repetitions appears to be twice, creating a trio with the original instance. Given the above examples, notice that the word before ""walm"" has the same color repeated twice more after ""walm"" in the output:
  - dax (green) walm -> green green green
  - lug (blue) walm dax (green) lug (blue) -> blue blue blue green blue
  - lug (red) walm lug (blue) -> red red red blue
  - wif (red) walm lug (blue) zup (yellow) -> red red red blue yellow
  - lug (blue) walm zup (yellow) wif (red) -> blue blue blue yellow red

Rule: walm -> the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it two more times, making a sequence of three of the same color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. In all instances, whenever the nonce word ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green."" Therefore, we can induce that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""red."" Here is the analysis:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to the second color, ""red.""
- Just ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red.""
- ""dax wif walm"" also includes ""wif"" translating to ""red.""
- In ""zup wif lug dax,"" ""wif"" is again translated to ""red.""
- Likewise, in ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: Based on the provided examples, bluf translates to the color red when it appears after the word wif, and to the color blue when it appears after the word lug. If we consider wif to correspond to the color red and lug to correspond to the color blue, then bluf takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

bluf -> meaning: bluf means red when following wif and blue when following lug.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" within this context, we must observe the relationship between the input and output sequences.

From the first example:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
The word ""wif"" appears before ""walm"", and ""dax"" follows it. Both ""wif"" and ""walm"" have the output red, while zup has the output yellow, which is different. ""Dax"" has the output green.

From the second example:
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
The sequence here has ""walm"" followed by ""dax"", while ""lug"" precedes it. We can see that ""dax"" consistently outputs green, but the outputs for ""walm"" are influenced by the word that comes before it. In this case, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", and both have the output blue. 

From the third example:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, the word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and both have the output yellow.

From the fourth example:
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
""Dax"" precedes ""walm"" and both have the output green.

From the fifth example:
Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and both have the output yellow.

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word:

Rule: The output color for ""walm"" matches the output color for the word immediately before it.

So we can deduce that:

walm -> The output color for ""walm"" is the same as the output color for the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow yellow,False,17
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the rule is:

Rule: lug means ""blue"".
From the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a particular color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red' regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the pattern indicates that 'wif' stands for the output color 'red' consistently.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: When ""zup"" is used in an input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output. If followed by other words, ""zup"" maintains its meaning (""yellow""), and the following words are translated to other colors as observed from the given input-output pairs:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Therefore, ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the words that accompany it.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the word ""bluf."" We can see that every time ""bluf"" is used in the input, ""red"" is produced twice in the output. This consistency allows us to infer that ""bluf"" corresponds to the double occurrence of the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes all the subsequent words (and itself) to be translated to the same color that the previous valid (non-walm) word was translated to. This continues until another non-walm word appears in the sequence.

For example:
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""walm"" causes the reiteration of ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" continues that with ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" continues the ""red"" until ""dax,"" which changes it to green.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it and the subsequent words take on the color of the immediately preceding non-walm word until a new non-walm word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Input: wif zup dax lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green"", where ""lug"" appears first and is translated as ""blue"".
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" appears first and is translated as ""blue"". ""walm"" is repeated, also translating to ""blue"".
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"", where ""lug"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup"" and translates to ""blue"".
- ""zup lug wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue red green blue"", where ""lug"" is preceded by ""zup"" and translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"", where ""lug"" is preceded by ""bluf"" and ""walm"" and both times translates to ""blue"".

The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"", regardless of its position or the context within the series of words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of what other words are present, ""dax"" always results in ""green."" 

The rest of the output does not seem to provide a clear pattern connecting the other nonce words (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf"") to specific colors consistently across examples. Without additional context or examples, we cannot reliably determine the rules for those words.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" based on the given examples is:

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word. 

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" is used, repeat the translation of the word that comes directly before ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the second word in the sequence (as in ""lug bluf""), it repeats the color that ""lug"" translates to, which is ""blue"". Similarly, if ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), then ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"", and so on.
Observing the provided examples, we can deduce the following occurrences of the nonce word ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
4. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
5. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow

In each instance, the output corresponding to ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. Here are the observed patterns:

- In example 1, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green"". Following ""walm"" we have three occurrences of ""green"".
- In example 2, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"". Following ""walm,"" we have three occurrences of ""yellow"".
- In example 3, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"". Following ""walm,"" we have three occurrences of ""blue"".
- In example 4, ""dax"" precedes the first ""walm"", and ""wif"" precedes the second ""walm"". The output for ""dax"" is ""green"", and thus the first ""walm"" is followed by three ""green"". The output for ""wif"" is ""red"", and thus the second ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"".
- In example 5, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". Following ""walm,"" we have three occurrences of ""red"".

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the next three outputs to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Causes the next three outputs to repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the color ""blue"" is included in the same position in the output. Additional words may correspond to other colors as evidenced in the examples, but we are focusing on the word ""lug"" here.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context. Each other word in the input sequence corresponds to a specific color (e.g., ""wif"" and ""walm"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow""), but the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" every time it appears.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and it appears that each subsequent nonce word corresponds to a different color as well. ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. When ""zup"" is followed by other words, it results in ""yellow"" followed by the colors associated with the other words. When ""zup"" is alone, the output is simply ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, where each input including the nonce word ""bluf"" results in an output of two identical colors, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the word that precedes it to be translated to a specific color, and that color is repeated twice.

Thus:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color associated with the word preceding ""bluf,"" repeated twice.
walm -> meaning. The meaning appears to be that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it in the list. If there is no word before ""walm,"" it takes the color yellow by default.

Rule: ""walm"" inherits the color of the preceding word, or defaults to yellow if it is the first word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the corresponding position in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This consistent substitution suggests that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
bluf -> yellow when following the word ""zup,"" blue when following the word ""lug,"" and green when following the word ""dax"".

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately preceding it. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow."" If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue."" If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the pattern of words in the input and their corresponding color outputs. By analyzing the examples provided, we can identify the rule that corresponds to ""walm.""

Looking at the examples:
1. ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" also corresponds to red, and ""walm"" results in the first deviation in pattern with green.
2. ""dax zup dax walm"" outputs ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to two different colors (green at the beginning and end), ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" at the end results in green again.
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow."" ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" leads to green again, and ""zup"" leads to yellow.
4. ""lug walm wif lug"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" is followed by red.
5. The last example is a repetition of the first, confirming the colors matched for ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax.""

From these observations, the word ""walm"" consistently results in the output color of green. Even when other words correspond to different colors in their second appearance, ""walm"" remains consistent in producing green. This constancy suggests the rule for ""walm"" is independent of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: walm -> green

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided where the input is transformed into different colored outputs, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""lug"":

lug -> blue

Therefore, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in an input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" The rule is consistent across all examples given. Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: ""green"" (since every occurrence of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output).

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
From the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to a particular color. To deduce the rule, let's examine the inputs and the respective outputs:

- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
- Input: dax walm wif walm zup
  Output: green green green red red red yellow
- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
  Output: blue red blue green green
- Input: dax zup walm wif
  Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
- Input: wif
  Output: red

Based on the examples:

- Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to ""red"" in the outputs.
- Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the sequence, it is always translated to ""red"".
- When ""wif"" occurs by itself, the output is ""red"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" is that it consistently represents the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There are no contextual changes or alterations to this pattern regardless of the other words present in the input. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> red
Observing the given examples, it seems that the introduction of the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here's how it breaks down:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" which suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" is introduced, yellow is repeated two more times.
  
- ""lug walm zup"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow"" suggesting ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated twice more before moving on to the next color corresponding to ""zup"" which is yellow.
  
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"", which further supports the idea that the presence of ""walm"" means that the color of the word before it is repeated twice more. ""dax"" would then correspond to green.

- ""lug walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue"" reinforces ""lug"" being associated with blue and being repeated twice more after ""walm"".
  
- The last example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"", translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" confirming that ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" this color is repeated twice more, and then the pattern continues with the next words.

Based on the pattern observed in the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used after another word, the output is the color corresponding to the prior word repeated three times in total. 

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times in total.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can induce that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"". Every instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output. There are no variations in the output associated with ""lug"", regardless of its position in the input or the context of other words. Therefore, the rule we can extract is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correlate with the color ""red"" in the output. Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input directly translates to ""red"" in the output. It is not dependent on its position in the sequence as it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or the only word in the input. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be: 

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, output ""red.""
Rule: The word ""zup"" seems to be translated as ""yellow."" This deduction comes from the direct mapping seen across all examples provided: every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Rule: bluf -> the color word that represents the color of the word that directly follows it in the input. If there is no word following it (i.e., ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence), its color is green as shown in the second example.
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: When ""walm"" appears, it indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" correlates with the output ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to decipher the rule behind the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs and outputs to find patterns.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

From the first input and output, it is not initially clear what 'bluf' corresponds to because there are two colors associated with it: red red. However, comparing this with other examples, we see that 'bluf' could be introducing a repetition of another color in the output.

Looking at the second example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow red green"", and we see that 'bluf' is followed by a repeated color ""yellow"".

In the third example, ""zup bluf"" simply translates to ""yellow yellow"", which is a direct repetition.

The fourth and fifth examples confirm this pattern: every time 'bluf' is present, the color directly before 'bluf' is repeated in the output.

Therefore, the rule for 'bluf' is:

bluf -> meaning. The word 'bluf' means to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes 'bluf'. Rule: Repeat the previous color in the output sequence.

To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

1. In the first input-output pair:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a series of ""yellow.""

2. In the second input-output pair:
Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

After ""walm,"" the rest of the series is ""yellow.""

3. In the third input-output pair:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, ""walm"" is associated with repetitions of the color ""green"" which came right before it.

4. In the fourth input-output pair:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Once again, ""walm"" is followed by a series of the color that appeared right before it, ""blue"" in this case.

5. In the fifth input-output pair:
Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

""Walm"" is followed by repeated colors of the word before it, ""blue.""

Based on the above observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Therefore, we can define ""walm"" as:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.

So,

Walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently correlates to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule we can deduce for the meaning of ""dax"" is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correspond directly to the color 'red'. No matter the context or combination with other words, every single occurrence of ""wif"" results in 'red' appearing in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""  Here's the breakdown of the evidence:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""red yellow,"" which suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" stands alone, the output is simply ""yellow.""
3. In the example ""lug walm zup walm,"" the pattern suggests that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" to a repetition of the previously mentioned color, since ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow."" In each case, ""walm"" seems to double the output of the prior word.
4. With ""zup lug wif dax lug,"" the sequence suggests that ""lug"" again translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" maintains its translation of ""yellow.""
5. For ""zup dax,"" since ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" from the previous example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as before.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color word that corresponds to the first word. Rule:

If the input is ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
If the input is ""lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""

Thus, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" When ""bluf"" follows these words, the rule is to repeat the color associated with the first word twice.
walm -> color repetition of the preceding word

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the word preceding it to be repeated in the output sequence. If the preceding word is 'lug', which corresponds to 'blue', the output is 'blue blue blue'. If the preceding word is 'wif', which corresponds to 'red', the output is 'red red red', and so on. If 'walm' is followed by 'dax', the sequence ends with 'green', otherwise, it does not.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in each of the provided examples.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" It does not seem to matter where it appears in the sequence:

- zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
- lug wif dax wif -> blue red green red
- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
- wif -> red
- wif -> red

The word ""wif"" is therefore consistently associated with the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input or the presence of other words.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

From the examples provided, every instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding context. This consistent mapping suggests that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
bluf -> reduplicates the color word that precedes it.

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" follows a color-generating word, it results in the output of that color word being repeated. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no color word precedes it, the rule cannot be determined from the given examples, therefore, the rule applies only when there's a color word before ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the output colors associated with its occurrence:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. wif walm -> red red red
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
5. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From the examples, we can make the following observations:

- In the first example, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color changes from green to green green, suggesting that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is three reds instead of the expected two, indicating that ""walm"" might be repeating the color associated with the previous word, which is red in this case.
- In the third example, again, ""walm"" seems to be repeating the red associated with ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" repeats the blue color associated with ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" repeats the color pattern associated with ""zup"" twice after ""lug zup,"" ending with yellow yellow yellow.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word one or more times depending on its position and the context of use.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,26
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" This can be seen in each instance where the word ""lug"" is used, the word ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Looking at the provided examples, we can see a pattern between the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding output color. We'll examine each example:

- In the first example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" this indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in this instance.
  
- In the second example, ""wif zup wif"" translates to ""red yellow red."" The inclusion of ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" between two instances of ""wif"" leading to ""red"" suggests that ""wif"" consistently aligns with the color ""red.""

- The third and fourth examples further support that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as ""wif"" is independently translated to ""red"" regardless of its position relative to other words.

- The last example, ""dax wif dax,"" translates to ""green red green,"" showing that ""wif"" is sandwiched between two ""dax"" words, which correspond to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is consistently translated as ""red"" standing on its own.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow in the outputs provided.
To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should examine the examples and look for a pattern.

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.
3. ""Bluf"" appears to simply repeat the color associated with the word right before it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it outputs the same color as the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the word 'walm' seems to correspond with repeating the color assigned to the previous word. For instance, in the first example, 'dax' is green and after 'walm' is mentioned, green is repeated. The pattern continues in all the other examples presented.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: In each example, the word 'dax' consistently translates to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Thus, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red. Every time ""bluf"" is used, the output is red. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red.
From the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the preceding nonce word. Therefore, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the last color encountered before it appears. Here's the rule based on each example:

- lug walm -> lug corresponds to blue, and walm repeats it three times.
- zup dax walm zup wif -> zup corresponds to yellow, dax corresponds to green, and walm repeats the last color (green) three times, followed by a yellow from zup and a red from wif.
- zup bluf wif walm -> zup corresponds to yellow, bluf is also yellow, wif corresponds to red, and walm repeats the last color (red) three times.
- lug walm zup lug zup wif -> lug corresponds to blue, walm repeats it twice, followed by a yellow from zup, another blue from lug, and ends with a yellow from zup and a red from wif.
- dax lug walm -> dax corresponds to green, lug corresponds to blue, and walm repeats the last color (blue) three times.

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the last mentioned color multiple times. The number of repetitions can vary based on some unspecified rule, but it is always a repeat of the last color mentioned before the word ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, we can induce that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. Meanwhile, other words seem to correspond to different colors, with ""zup"" potentially corresponding to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples, whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" Thus, it can be deduced that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Other words seem to have their own corresponding colors as well, such as ""dax"" correlating to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Zup"" appears to be ""yellow."" However, since ""wif"" has been consistently translated to ""red"" in every instance of its occurrence, it seems clear what it represents.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context it is used in within the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that the word before ""bluf"" translates to. Here are the specific observations that support this rule:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". ""Wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" follows the same color.
2. In the second example, ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green"". ""Dax"" translates to ""green"", and similarly, ""bluf"" follows by also being ""green"".
3. In the third example, again ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" takes on that same color.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" is ""green green"", aligning with the prior observations.
5. In the fifth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", which is consistent with the pattern where ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it (""lug"" translates to ""blue"").

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of a color three times. The color repeated appears to be dependent on the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". Here are the associations:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""

When ""zup"" is before ""walm"", the result is three repetitions of ""yellow"".
When ""lug"" is before ""walm"", the result is three repetitions of ""blue"".
When ""dax"" is before ""walm"", the result is three repetitions of ""green"".
When ""wif"" is before ""walm"", the result is three repetitions of ""red"".

Furthermore, when ""walm"" appears twice as in the example ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the pattern of color repetition applies for each instance separately. ""Wif walm"" generates ""red red red"", and ""zup walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Thus, we can extrapolate the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" signifies a command to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the given examples, regardless of the context it appears in.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
According to the examples provided, 'zup' corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red."" Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which we can deduce means ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" which translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup dax lug wif dax"" becomes ""yellow green blue red green."" The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" alone translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup dax zup wif"" turns into ""green yellow green yellow red."" The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" again with ""zup"" being ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Let's analyze:

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" produces another red.
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, hence ""bluf"" also produces green.
- For ""wif dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" gives yellow, followed by ""bluf,"" which gives another yellow.
- ""zup bluf wif"" has ""zup"" giving yellow and ""bluf"" duplicating that yellow before ""wif"" gives red.
- And lastly, ""wif bluf dax walm"" shows that ""bluf"" duplicates ""wif"" as red, then ""dax"" results in green followed by ""walm,"" which adds another green.

From these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word prior to it.
Observing the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to result in the same color being repeated three additional times. Here are the associations:

- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, then ""walm"" causes the color red to appear three more times.
- In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, then ""walm"" makes green repeat three times before moving onto ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In ""dax walm wif dax,"" ""dax"" is green and is followed by three more greens because of ""walm,"" then the sequence continues as usual.
- In ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, so ""walm"" results in three more yellows.
- In ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" leads to three additional blues; then ""zup"" introduces yellow, and the subsequent ""walm"" leads to three more yellows.

Accordingly, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning is the color blue. Rule: Whenever 'lug' appears in the input, the word 'blue' corresponds to it in the output.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns within the examples provided that are consistent whenever the word ""dax"" is used.

Here is the analysis:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
2. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""
3. ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""
4. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red""
5. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""

From these examples, we can infer the following patterns:

- In every instance, the occurrence of the word ""dax"" correlates to the word ""green"" in the output.
- There is no immediate pattern in the surrounding words that alters the output for ""dax,"" suggesting that ""dax"" itself directly translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the context.
- Other words like ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" have outputs that vary in color, while ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems clear:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green"" (meaning that the word ""dax"" means ""green"").
Based on the examples provided, the term ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" In every instance where ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position:

- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
- ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
- ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
- ""wif zup lug wif"" -> ""red yellow blue red""

In this context, all other words in the input translate to a color in the output, but their translation is not based on the word alone but also on its position or sequence in the input (for example, ""lug"" can correspond to ""blue"" or ""yellow"" depending on its position).

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
wif -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, it appears that:

""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the input contains the word ""zup"", the output for that word is ""yellow"".
Given the examples, we observe that the output color directly corresponds to the position and presence of certain input words.

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the one instance it's present.

Looking at the examples where ""bluf"" is used, we can see that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word before it. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red""; when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" It does not matter where ""bluf"" appears in the sequence; it always causes a repetition of the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before bluf.
Based on the examples provided, walm appears to be associated with repeating the color denoted by the word before it three times. Here are the observations:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", ""yellow yellow yellow"" is outputted.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", ""blue blue blue"" is outputted.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", ""red red red"" is outputted.

This suggests a rule where ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color mentioned before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each example shows that whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Hence, it can be deduced that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
From the examples provided, it seems that each unique word translates to a specific color. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" and the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each example where it appears. The second example demonstrates the repetition of ""green"" with the word ""walm,"" which seems to indicate repeating the color of the word that comes before it. Since ""dax"" appears before ""walm,"" it is followed by repeated ""green"" outputs.

Given this consistent one-to-one correspondence between ""dax"" and ""green,"" we can deduce the rule.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule for determining the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be consistent regardless of its position in the input sequence. Looking at the outputs, every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". 

So, wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the pattern by matching the provided inputs with their respective outputs. Let's analyze each case:

1. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue

Based on the examples, bluf appears to replicate the color of the word immediately preceding it:
- In the first example, bluf follows dax, which corresponds to green, so bluf also becomes green.
- In the second example, bluf follows wif, which corresponds to red, so bluf becomes red.
- In the third example, bluf again follows zup, which corresponds to yellow, making bluf yellow.
- In the fourth example, it's directly after lug, which is blue, so bluf is blue.
- In the last example, bluf follows lug (blue) and later in the sequence, there's no bluf, but we can confirm the pattern since the rest of the output aligns with the previous rules deduced for lug, wif, and walm.

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is to take on the color of the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" follows a word that corresponds to ""blue"", then ""bluf"" means ""blue""; if it follows a word that corresponds to ""red"", then ""bluf"" means ""red""; and so on.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to translate to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. To be specific, the rules for translation of the words provided are as follows:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

When the word ""walm"" is used after any word, the output is that word's corresponding color repeated three times. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the preceding word's color to be repeated three times.

Hence:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, the term ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be expressed as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color 'red.' In each case where 'wif' is used, the output includes the color 'red.'

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> red red

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output always includes ""red red"" immediately afterwards. The surrounding words (""wif"", ""lug"", ""dax"") correspond to different colors in the output. The presence of ""bluf"" does not change the output of the surrounding words but simply adds ""red red"" to the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns and correspondences in each of the given examples:

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Looking at the input and output sequences, we can deduce that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. From these examples, we can extract the following correspondences:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

When the nonce word ""walm"" is used, we notice that the color after the word corresponds to the color of the word before ""walm."" For example:

- In the first input, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Following ""walm"" is ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue."" Hence the output around ""walm"" is ""red blue.""
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is followed by no other words, so the color after ""walm"" is red, repeating the color of ""wif.""
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is again followed by no other words, repeating the red color.
- In the fourth input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" so blue is the color before and after ""walm.""
- The fifth input is the same as the third and results in the same pattern of colors.

From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""walm"" to repeat once immediately after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the sequence, repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Every time the word ""dax"" is present in an input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Analyzing the examples given, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence or the other words around it. Let's validate this by checking each example:

Input: dax wif -> Output: green red (Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".)
Input: zup wif lug -> Output: yellow red blue (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again.)
Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: red red yellow yellow red (""wif"" appears twice and both times it outputs ""red"".)
Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red (Only ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; ""walm"" seems to mean ""red red"".)
Input: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output: green red green yellow yellow (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again.)

Hence, the consistent rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

So, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each of the examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a duplication of the color word that precedes it. Each input word seems to translate to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

When ""bluf"" follows any of these color words, the color is repeated in the output.

Here is the rule:

bluf -> repeat the preceding color word.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is two of that color word.
Based on the examples given, we observe the following patterns:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, the word ""walm"" follows specific words (""wif"", ""lug"", and ""dax"") and causes the next word to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
- In example 2, the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", then followed by ""green,"" indicating ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Let's consider each input and output to derive the meaning:

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue,"" showcasing that ""walm"" causes the color ""red,"" associated with ""wif,"" to repeat until a new word (""lug"") with a different associated color (""blue"") appears.
   
2. ""lug walm dax"" gives ""blue blue blue green,"" so after ""lug,"" which is associated with ""blue,"" ""walm"" again causes the color to repeat until ""dax"" changes it to green.

3. ""zup walm wif"" has the output ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word ""zup"" (""yellow"") to repeat until a new color (""red"") is introduced with ""wif.""

4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" illustrating that ""walm"" causes repetition of ""blue"" from ""lug"" until ""zup"" introduces a new color (""yellow""), which is then followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""
   
5. ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue,"" further confirming that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes right before it, which in this case is ""blue"" from ""lug.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat until a new word with a different associated color appears. 

Thus, the meaning can be stated as:

walm -> Causes the repetition of the previous word's associated color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,34
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" maps to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input.
Based on the presented examples, the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green."" It does not seem to depend on the position of the word ""dax"" within the input since its output is the same whether it's in the beginning, middle, or end. Other words in the input appear to correspond to different colors in the output (i.e., ""wif"" is always followed by ""red,"" and ""zup"" is always followed by ""yellow"").

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is used in an input, the word ""red"" is present in the output. Additionally, the output does not contain more ""red"" instances than the instances of ""wif"" in the input. Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"" regardless of the context in which it is used. This can be further supported by the example where only ""wif"" is provided as input, and the output is simply ""red.""

The rule for ""wif"" can therefore be stated as:

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the given input sequence.
bluf -> blue. Rule: When the nonce word 'bluf' appears in the input, it corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

In each output, the presence of ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""yellow"" repeated for the number of words preceding ""walm."" For example:

- In the first input example, there are three words before ""walm,"" and in the output, there are three ""yellow"" after ""blue.""
- In the second input example, there are four words before ""walm,"" resulting in four ""yellow"" in the output after ""blue.""
- In the third example, there are four words before ""walm"" and four ""yellow"" after ""blue"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, there are two words before ""walm,"" and in the output, there are two ""yellow"" after ""red.""
- In the fifth example, there are five words before ""walm,"" and in the output, there are five ""green"" after ""green.""

From this pattern, we can establish the rule:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for the number of total words that preceded ""walm"" in the input.

Rule: If 'X' is the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm,"" and 'n' is the number of words preceding ""walm,"" then ""walm"" translates to 'X' repeated 'n' times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the evidence provided, the word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in each example it appears. Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Given the examples, it appears that 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green'. There does not seem to be any context or condition that changes this outcome, as 'dax' always corresponds to 'green' regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' consistently means 'green' in every provided context.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we can look at the patterns in the examples provided:

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Input: wif
Output: red

In every instance, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the sequence, the output is consistently ""red."" There is no context provided that indicates the meaning of ""wif"" is dependent on any other words or the position within the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
From the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Whenever zup is mentioned alone, the output is yellow.
2. Whenever zup is mentioned along with other words (wif, dax, bluf), the output always includes yellow along with other colors that correspond to the additional words.

These observations lead us to deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Meaning that the term ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to a color in the output. More specifically, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color that is immediately preceding it in the input sequence. Given this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

bluf -> meaning: The same color as the word preceding it in the input.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output will repeat the color associated with that word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it three times. In each case, the output is the color associated with the word before ""walm"" repeated three times, regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input:

- Lug is associated with blue. (""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"")
- Dax is associated with green. (""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"")
- Wif is associated with red, but only triggers a repetition when ""walm"" is present. (""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red"")
- Zup is associated with yellow. (""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"")

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is produced in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence. This is consistent across all examples provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs, focusing on the position of ""wif"" and the corresponding output:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
2. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
3. ""zup dax lug wif dax"" -> ""yellow green blue red green""
4. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue""
5. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""

Looking at the examples, it seems that ""wif"" always translates to ""red."" However, one must also check whether the position of ""wif"" relative to other words affects this output or if there are any other influencing factors.

From examples 1, 4, and 5, we can see that ""wif"" is the first word, the fourth word, and the first word again, respectively, yet it consistently translates to ""red"" in all cases. Example 2 features ""wif"" as the last word, and example 3 has ""wif"" in the middle, but both cases yield ""red"" for ""wif.""

One potential confusion could arise from example 1, ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red,"" as it might imply that ""bluf"" also means ""red."" However, looking at other examples, there's no other occurrence of ""bluf"" to confirm another meaning. Since each appearance of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" regardless of the words that come before or after it, we can infer that other words in the sequence do not change its meaning.

Additionally, the positions of the other words with respect to ""wif"" appear to have consistent translations regardless of ""wif's"" presence: ""dax"" -> ""green,"" ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" etc.

Based on this information, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that ""wif"" represents the color ""red"" in all the given contexts, irrespective of its position or surrounding words.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Here's the apparent mapping from the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue (deduced from the second input where it appears and seems to correspond to blue in the output)
- wif -> red (deduced from the fourth input where it appears next to bluf and the output is ""red red"" after ""yellow yellow"")

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue. Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color previously mentioned. Here is how ""walm"" operates in each scenario:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which is translated as ""yellow"". Thus, ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"".

2. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   Again, ""walm"" follows the color words ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow) and results in their repetition.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   The pattern continues with ""walm"" following ""dax"" and ""lug"", causing ""green"" and ""blue"" to repeat respectively.

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"".

5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"", causing the repetition of ""red"".

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green in every example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we will look at the correlation between the input and output sequences. We will consider each input word and its corresponding output color to detect a pattern related to ""wif.""

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
3. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif -> Output: yellow green green green blue red
5. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red

We can observe that for every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output, regardless of its position. Other words correspond to their own unique colors, such as ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and so on. The word ""wif"" produces ""red"" every time it is used.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a rule dependent on the context. Rule: The word ""bluf"" serves as a mirror or duplicator for the color word that precedes it. In each instance, ""bluf"" takes the color word before it and produces an output where that color word is repeated. For example, ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red"" - this indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetitive output of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" appears to involve repeating the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: If ""bluf"" comes before a word other than ""zup,"" it translates to ""blue""; if ""bluf"" comes before ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""
walm -> repeats the color word that precedes it three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns for the nonces ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"":

- Every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the Output.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, as seen in the first two examples.
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue when not preceded by ""lug."" However, ""bluf"" following the word ""lug"" results in the same color being repeated in the Output (blue blue).
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, as seen in the fourth example.
- ""walm"" seems to generate the color green repeated for each letter in ""walm"" when it follows ""dax"" (as seen in the fifth example).

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule governing the use of the nonce word ""dax."" To do this, let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever ""dax"" is used, the output includes ""green.""
- The output sequence does not seem to be directly tied to the position of ""dax"" in the input sentence.
- ""Dax"" does not seem to change meaning based on the words around it.
- All other non-""dax"" words have consistently associated with a single color in the output. ""Wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" correlates with ""red.""

Given these observations, the simplest conclusion is that ""dax"" correlates consistently with the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, the rule appears to involve a direct mapping of the nonce word ""wif"" to the color ""red,"" and the other words to specific colors. The repetitive nature of the outputs corresponding to each word suggests that this mapping is consistent. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Here is the rule derived from the inputs and outputs given:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

1. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
2. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Now, let's analyze where ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding outputs:

1. bluf -> green
2. bluf -> red
3. bluf -> yellow
4. bluf -> blue
5. bluf -> red

Considering ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors in each output, it does not represent a single static color. Moreover, we can see that ""bluf"" takes the color output of the word immediately preceding it:

1. dax -> green; bluf -> green
2. wif -> red; bluf -> red
3. zup -> yellow; bluf -> yellow
4. lug -> blue; bluf -> blue
5. wif -> red; bluf -> red

Based on this, we can deduce that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color value of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the inputs and outputs.

Analyzing each input where ""walm"" appears, alongside its output:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm 
   Output: red red green green green
   
2. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   
3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   
5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

We observe that each input results in a sequence of colors with each word mapped to a specific color, except for ""walm,"" which appears to produce a sequence of the same color repeated (excluding the final colors, which correspond to the words coming after ""walm""). The color it generates seems to depend on the word that precedes it. Here's the pattern for ""walm"" contextualized by the preceding word:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" is not the first word and is not immediately preceded by a specific word that has already been associated with a color sequence, the output is ""red red red"" (as evidenced in the third example).

Based on this pattern, we can induce that the word ""walm"" generates a rule which repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> results in the color corresponding to the preceding word being repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

Each example shows that the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" in the output, no matter the position or context within the series of words.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze each example and its corresponding output. We'll look for patterns that occur only when ""zup"" is present.

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   - ""zup"" occurs between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which are colored red and green, respectively. ""Zup"" correlates to the color yellow.

2. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - ""zup"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is represented by yellow.

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Zup"" at the beginning is yellow, and the ""zup"" between ""lug"" and ""walm"" (blue and yellow, respectively) is also yellow.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and all outputs are yellow.

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""Zup"" appears both at the beginning and between ""dax"" and ""dax"" (green, green), and in both cases, it is represented by yellow. 

Based on these examples, ""zup"" consistently correlates to the color yellow, regardless of its position or surrounding words. No other conditions appear to change this output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Walm -> repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding the occurrence of ""walm"".

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it takes the color of the word directly before it and repeats that color for as many times as ""walm"" appears, effectively replacing its own unique color, if any, with the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" is seen in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following associations between the input words and the output colors:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now by analyzing the position and the output color of ""wif"" in various contexts, we observe that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" is used, it consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" It does not appear to matter where ""zup"" is positioned within the sequence of words; it consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples, it appears that the ""bluf"" token translates to a repeated color word derived from the previous word or phrase. For instance, ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue,"" with ""bluf"" corresponding to ""blue"" repeated. Similarly, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" so here ""bluf"" repeats the color implied by the word ""wif."" Therefore, ""bluf"" repeats the color word immediately preceding it.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is the immediate previous color word repeated.
Based on the examples provided, it looks like the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the previous color output an additional two times. The previous color before ""walm"" is mentioned in each example is red (""wif"" apparently signifies red), and after ""walm"", red is repeated two more times consistently.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color twice more.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue.
Analyzing the input and corresponding output, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" by looking for patterns or consistencies. Here are the observations:

1. In each example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
2. It appears that ""dax"" does not change meaning based on its position in the sequence.
3. The presence of ""dax"" in input is always translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of which words come before or after it.

Based on these observations, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" is translated to the color ""yellow"" consistently in all the examples except where the word ""lug"" immediately follows it. When ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" is translated to ""blue."" There does not seem to be any other conditions affecting the translation of ""bluf."" 

The rule is as follows:

Rule: bluf means ""yellow"" unless it is followed by ""lug,"" in which case it means ""blue."" 

Therefore:

bluf -> ""yellow"" (default)
bluf followed by lug -> ""blue""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" correlates with ""green."" Since the output is composed of color names, we can guess that each word in the input is translated into a specific color. Across all examples, whenever ""walm"" is present, the corresponding output is a sequence of ""green.""

Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output sequence includes three ""red"" preceding the ""green"" corresponding to ""walm.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" regardless of what it precedes, the output sequence includes multiple ""green,"" with the number of greens matching the position of ""walm"" in the output sequence.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it is preceded by one ""blue"" and followed by sequence of ""green.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output sequence includes two ""yellow"" preceding the ""green"" corresponding to ""walm.""

The rule for other words seems to be constant for each word, for example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" and ""zup"" lead to ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, when followed by ""walm"". 

Considering all the evidence, we can induce the following:

walm -> green. 

Rule: When ""walm"" is in an input sequence, the corresponding output is one or multiple instances of ""green,"" with the number correlating with the position of ""walm"" in the sequence (i.e., its position in the output seems to be the last color mentioned in a repeating sequence whose length is determined by where ""walm"" is situated).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,43
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears as an input, the output is always ""green"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

The consistent pattern is that each nonce word translates to a specific color. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Regardless of the context or position in the sequence, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup -> Repeat previous word and color. 

Analyzing the examples, whenever the nonce word ""zup"" is used, the previous word is repeated, and the associated color for that word is also repeated. For example, in ""wif walm zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" is associated with yellow and is immediately preceded by the word ""zup,"" resulting in ""walm"" (yellow) being repeated three times following the ""zup."" Similarly, in ""dax zup dax walm,"" the word ""dax"" is associated with green and is immediately preceded by the word ""zup,"" so ""dax"" (green) is repeated twice after ""zup."" The trend continues consistently across the examples, validating the rule.
bluf -> duplicates the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When bluf follows a word, the output is two instances of the color that corresponds to the preceding word. For example, if ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" If ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. Input: lug walm zup -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
3. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
4. Input: lug dax walm -> Output: blue green green green
5. Input: dax walm lug -> Output: green green green blue

Now let's analyze:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""lug"" appears before ""walm"" and the output is blue, followed by more blues.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is the last word, and the output ends with greens, suggesting that ""walm"" may continue the color of the word before it.
- Example 4 has ""lug"" followed by ""dax"" before ""walm,"" and the output is blue, followed by greens, similar to the colors of ""lug"" and ""dax"" before they are repeated, so ""walm"" likely continues the pattern.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""lug,"" and the output has greens (matching ""dax"") followed by a blue (matching ""lug""), suggesting ""walm"" takes the color pattern of the word before it and continues it until the next word.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it until a new word introduces a different color.

Therefore:
walm -> repeats the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow,False,44
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the context or presence of other words. The presence of other words ('dax', 'wif', 'walm') seems to map to different colors ('green', 'red', 'blue' respectively) that are separate from the word ""lug."" 

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word is associated with a specific color, and the color is repeated as many times as the word appears in the input. When considering the word ""dax,"" we see it always corresponds to the color ""green."" The number of times ""green"" appears is exactly the number of times ""dax"" appears in the input. This suggests that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green.""

Thus, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Analyzing the input and output pairs given, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs carefully, considering the position of ""zup"" in the sequence and the corresponding output.

From the examples:
1. ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""
2. ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow.""
3. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
4. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red.""
5. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow.""

By inspecting the position and corresponding output where ""zup"" appears, it seems consistent that whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"" for that particular position, regardless of the order or other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here is the correlation:

- dax bluf -> green green (bluf repeats the color of ""dax"")
- lug bluf wif -> blue blue red (bluf repeats the color of ""lug"")
- lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue red blue blue (bluf repeats the color of the second ""lug"")
- zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow (bluf repeats the color of ""zup"" and second time repeats the color of ""lug"")
- wif bluf -> red red (bluf repeats the color of ""wif"")

Rule:
bluf -> repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The color must be repeated once for each occurrence of ""walm"" immediately following that word. If we look at the provided outputs, ""walm"" does not have its own color but informs how many times the preceding color is repeated.

Let's analyze the examples to better understand the rule:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and since ""walm"" follows it, ""yellow"" is repeated once. Another ""walm"" entails one more repetition of ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the following ""walm"" means ""red"" is repeated twice more.

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is repeated two more times, for a total of three.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - Another ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and since ""walm"" follows it, ""green"" is repeated twice more.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is repeated two more times.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is succeeded by ""walm"", thus ""yellow"" is repeated two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word. Each ""walm"" results in one additional repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" seems to represent the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following mappings of input words to output colors:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- bluf -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Each example starts or contains the word ""dax"" which consistently maps to the color ""green."" Given that the word ""dax"" appears to produce the same result regardless of its position in the sequence, we can conclude that ""dax"" is not context-dependent in these examples; rather, it uniquely maps to the color green each time it occurs.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. There is no indication from the examples that ""wif"" changes its meaning based on context; it always translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look closely at the examples provided:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
2. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
3. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
4. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
5. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

From the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- The word ""bluf"" seems to cause the word immediately preceding it to repeat its corresponding output color.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of ""dax's"" mapped color.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red blue,"" which suggests ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and again ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of ""wif's"" mapped color.
- Similarly, ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of ""lug's"" mapped color, which is ""blue.""

Considering this pattern, we can formulate the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf causes the color associated with the word that precedes it to be repeated in the output.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the previous word in the output sequence.
Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance of the word ""lug"" in the input results in the word ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, the other words seem to dictate different colors: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""red"". The word ""walm"" does not have a corresponding output color in the presented examples, but based on the last example, it seems to repeat the previous color since ""lug"" which means blue is repeated twice when followed by ""walm.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the rule that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""yellow."" This pattern is consistent across all provided examples. Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern regarding the occurrences of ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors:

- Every instance of ""walm"" in the input results in multiple occurrences of a color in the output.
- The occurrences of ""walm"" appear to be associated with the color that directly precedes their set of output colors.
- The number of color repetitions correlates with the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.

Let us analyze the provided examples in detail:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Here, ""wif"" triggers a ""red"" output, and after ""walm"" we see ""red"" repeated twice more, for a total of three ""red"" instances.

2. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""lug"" triggers a ""blue"" output, and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated two more times. After ""zup"" we see a ""yellow"" output, and after the second ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" repeated two more times.

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Here, ""wif"" triggers a ""red"" output, ""dax"" triggers ""green,"" and ""lug"" triggers ""blue."" After ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated two more times.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Here, ""lug"" triggers a ""blue"" output. After ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated two more times, after ""zup"" we see ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug"" which triggers another ""blue."" After the final ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated two more times.

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Here, ""wif"" triggers a ""red"" output, and after ""walm"" ""red"" appears two more times.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated two additional times. If ""walm"" is repeated, this effect continues with each instance of ""walm"" creating two additional repetitions.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: causes the preceding color to be repeated two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,False,47
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each subsequent word seems to correspond to a unique color as well. 

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". 
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". 
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". 
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" (which is the same as ""dax"").

Hence, we can deduce that ""dax"" -> green.
To understand the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

Input: wif lug zup
Output: red blue yellow

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

Looking through the examples given, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output. It is also observed that the ordering of translated colors matches the ordering of words in the inputs. Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" refers to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" at the end corresponds to a doubling of ""red.""

2. wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Here ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red,"" while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Following this, ""bluf"" seems to double the color preceding it, turning ""blue"" into ""blue blue.""

3. wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   Following the rule, ""bluf"" doubles the ""red"" that precedes it, resulting in ""red red.""

4. lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   Again ""bluf"" doubles the preceding color, turning ""blue"" into ""blue blue"" and ""green"" into ""green green.""

5. zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   ""Bluf"" doubles the preceding color ""yellow"" resulting in ""yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it. Thus, the meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the preceding color.
From the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color associated with the previous word. To deduce this, observe the following:

- In the first example, the word following ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and the output color is green, repeated from ""dax walm.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" and the color is once again green, repeating the output color associated with ""dax.""
- In the third example, after ""walm,"" the color is red, which repeats the output color of the preceding word ""wif.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" continues the pattern of repeating the color of the previous word.

Based on this analysis, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the previous word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
From the given examples, we can deduce that each word corresponds to a color. In particular, we need to determine what color ""dax"" represents. We can first list the known color associations based on the provided examples:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> green
- wif -> red

Now, looking at the appearances of ""dax"" and the corresponding output colors, we observe the following correlations:

Example 1: 
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Example 2:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Example 3:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Example 4:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Example 5:
- Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

In all examples given, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the surrounding words, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"".

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the appearance of certain words corresponds to a color. We can associate each unique word with a specific color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow
- zup -> yellow (Since both 'zup wif bluf' and 'bluf zup dax' have the yellow color associated with 'zup' and its position in the sequence does not seem to affect the color output)

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""blue."" Here is the supporting evidence:

- In the first example, each occurrence of ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" and since we know ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" should also mean ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" again corresponds to ""blue blue,"" further supporting the idea that ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" and since ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" remains consistent with ""blue.""
- The fourth example doesn't directly show the word ""bluf"" corresponding to ""blue,"" but the sequence and the absence of other colors suggest that ""bluf"" could be ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears without ""lug"" but is followed by or precedes a color; it corresponds to ""green"" and ""red"" suggesting that ""bluf"" itself translates directly to ""blue,"" as it is the only color word not accounted for by ""dax"" (""green"") or ""wif"" (""red"").

So, the rule is:

bluf -> blue
Analyzing the examples given and the respective outputs, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here's what we observe:

1. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the word ""blue"" appears in the output once, followed by additional ""green"" words for each occurrence of ""walm.""

To formulate this into a rule:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: The first occurrence of ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" and each subsequent occurrence of ""walm"" translates to ""green"" in the output. Rule: For the first ""walm,"" use ""blue."" For additional ""walm"" occurrences, use ""green"" for each.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
By examining the position of the word ""dax"" in the input and the corresponding color in the output, we can infer the rule underlying its meaning:

- When ""dax"" follows ""zup"", the output color is green (""zup dax bluf"" -> yellow green green).
- When ""dax"" is the first word, it also translates to green (""dax walm wif"" -> green green green red).
- ""dax"" following ""wif"" again yields green (""wif dax zup"" -> red green yellow).
- ""dax"" remains green regardless of its position, as shown in ""dax lug walm"" resulting in green as the first output color (green blue blue blue).
- Even when ""dax"" appears as the second word without a third word, the output is green (""lug dax"" -> blue green).

Considering these observations, the consistent output associated with ""dax"" allows us to deduce its meaning.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided where ""wif"" appears and its accompanying output, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds with the appearance of the word ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for a consistent pattern in the examples given. Let's break down each example and see if we can find a common rule that applies to all cases.

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""red.""

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   In this example, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue"" here.

3. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" following a ""lug.""

4. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
   ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" giving us ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" again results in ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

Based on the above examples, we can discern a pattern: the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it. This rule applies consistently across all given examples.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is repeat the color term before it.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to represent a rule that repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. Here's the relationship broken down for each input:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Analysis: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""lug"" and ""zup"" precede their respective ""walm"" and ""blue"" and ""yellow"" are each repeated three times.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

5. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Analysis: ""wif"" precedes the first ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated three times; ""lug"" does not have ""walm"" following it at this instance, so ""blue"" is repeated only twice for ""bluf.""

Rule: walm -> when preceding a color word, repeat the corresponding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. For instance, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.

Therefore, according to the examples provided:

lug -> meaning. Meaning: lug represents the color blue. Rule: When ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" is presented in the input, the word ""green"" is included in the output. 

Additionally, the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" according to the third and fifth examples. It is not entirely clear what ""zup"" translates to, but ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the fifth example. Since there is only one instance of ""zup,"" it is not possible to conclusively determine its meaning without additional context or examples, but it seems to indicate ""yellow"" based on the available information.

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to identify any patterns or consistent associations with outputs. Based on the color outputs corresponding with the presence of the word ""wif,"" we observe that every time ""wif"" is input, the output is ""red."" There are no examples provided where ""wif"" is associated with a different color.

Additionally, we can infer meanings of other nonce words from the examples provided:

- When ""dax"" is input, the output is ""green.""
- When ""zup"" is input, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is input, the output is ""red.""
- When ""lug"" is input, the output is ""blue.""

Given this, it appears that each nonce word is consistently associated with a specific color. With ""wif"" always resulting in ""red,"" we can infer that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" duplicates the color word that immediately precedes it. 

So, ""bluf"" -> meaning:

- ""lug bluf"" means ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" means blue, and ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color.
- ""zup bluf"" means ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" means yellow, and ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color.
- ""wif bluf"" in ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red red"" because ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color (red) before it moves on to the next colors signified by ""lug"" and ""zup"".
- ""lug bluf"" in ""lug bluf dax lug"" results in ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" means blue, and ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color (blue) before moving on to ""dax"" and another ""lug"".
- ""zup bluf"" in ""wif zup bluf lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" means yellow, and ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color (yellow) before the sequence ends with ""lug"" which means blue. 

It is important to note that ""bluf"" does not have meaning on its own; its meaning is context-dependent, as it requires a preceding color word to determine its output.
Walm -> meaning. Meaning: repetition of the previous color thrice.

Rule: The term ""walm"" means to repeat the color before it three times. For instance, if the color before ""walm"" is blue, then ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" correlates with the output ""blue."" Regardless of the other words surrounding ""lug,"" the presence of ""lug"" always ensures the inclusion of the word ""blue"" in the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Here's how the deduction works with each example:

1. dax wif zup dax - green red yellow green
2. lug wif dax - blue red green
3. dax lug wif walm - green blue red red red
4. wif - red
5. lug wif bluf - blue red red

In all instances, every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. No contextual dependencies or additional patterns are affecting the translation of ""wif"" in these examples.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color yellow.
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: If a color word like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup"" appears right before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" repeats the color of that word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's start by analyzing the outputs corresponding to the given inputs line by line:

- In the first input (dax lug dax lug walm), ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After four words that map to specific colors, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color ""blue.""
- In the second input (wif walm), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and after it, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color ""red.""
- In the third input (lug walm wif lug), ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""blue,"" ""wif"" introduces ""red,"" and the next ""lug"" returns to ""blue.""
- In the fourth input (lug walm zup lug zup wif), the pattern of corresponding colors continues: ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to a repetition of ""blue,"" ""zup"" introduces ""yellow,"" the next ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" the next ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" finally corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth input (wif walm dax zup), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" results in a continuation of ""red,"" ""dax"" changes it to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Considering the patterns, it seems clear that the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color of the previously mentioned word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, we can see a consistent pattern in which the word ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green."" No matter the position of ""dax"" within the input or the words that accompany it, the output color ""green"" always appears associated with ""dax."" Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning assigned to the nonce word ""dax"" in this context is the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" consistently. Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in an input, the output includes ""red."" The other words in the examples correlate with different colors, but ""wif"" consistently means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples provided consistently show that whenever the term ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the output in the corresponding position. Therefore, ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
bluf -> duplicates the color word that immediately precedes it in the Output.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color word, the output is that same color word repeated.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be that it represents a repetition of the color that precedes it. For each instance of ""walm"", the output color corresponds to the previous color mentioned.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green. Every time ""dax"" appears as an input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, each time the word ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the output ""red."" Regardless of what precedes or follows ""wif,"" the output for ""wif"" remains consistent. This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the provided examples. Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" in the output.
To determine what the nonce word ""bluf"" means, let's analyze the input/output pairs provided.

1. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

Looking closely, we can see that the word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in the output's color:

1. In ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", and the color ""red"" is repeated.
2. In ""dax bluf"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", and the color ""green"" is repeated.
3. In ""dax zup bluf"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", and the color ""yellow"" is repeated.
4. In ""zup wif bluf"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", and the color ""red"" is repeated.
5. In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", and the color ""yellow"" is repeated; subsequently, ""bluf"" is succeeded by ""wif"", leading to a second ""red"" (no additional bluf is present but it appears the effects of bluf continue until a different non-color term is encountered).

Based on this pattern, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word that precedes it to repeat until a different non-color term is encountered.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to repeat until a different non-color word interrupts.
walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that preceding word is then repeated three times in the output. For instance:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because the color associated with ""lug"" is blue.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" because the color associated with ""wif"" is red.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because the color associated with ""dax"" is green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it appears that the word ""lug"" can be directly translated to the color ""blue."" Each instance of the term ""lug"" in the input is directly followed by the word ""blue"" in the output. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule: lug -> blue
From the examples provided, each unique word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word 'dax' is consistently associated with the color 'green'. Therefore, we can induce that 'dax' corresponds to the color green. 

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" in the inputs is consistently translated to ""yellow"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: The word bluf translates to the color represented by the immediately preceding word. 

Explanation:

- In the first and third example where ""zup bluf"" is followed by either ""dax"" or no other word, the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that bluf takes on the color value of the word just before it—here, ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" which again shows that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- The second example is slightly more complex with the sequence ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" resulting in ""yellow yellow red blue green."" Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" while ""bluf,"" following ""zup,"" also translates to ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow green yellow green red red,"" where each word translates to a color except for ""bluf,"" which, following ""wif"" (red), results in ""red,"" consistent with the identified rule.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule mentioned above. 

bluf -> takes on the color value of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let`s look at each example and its corresponding output to find consistent patterns:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

Analyzing the input and output pairs:

- In examples 1 and 3, the word ""walm"" is directly followed by output ""red red red"". This suggests that the word ""walm"" directly translates to three reds in a row.
- In example 2, ""wif walm"" appears twice and each time it is matched with ""red red red"", reinforcing the rule discovered from examples 1 and 3.
- In example 4 and example 5, when ""walm"" appears after ""wif"", in both cases it corresponds with ""red red red"". This again confirms our rule without contradiction.

Based on the consistent pattern across these examples, the rule can be inferred:

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to three consecutive ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: red red red

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue."" Every instance of ""lug"" in the examples is replaced by the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the words around it.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There is no context within the examples that changes the meaning of ""zup."" It consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of the other words present in the input. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

Based on these examples, the word ""bluf"" always seems to result in the repetition of the color word that precedes it. To break it down further:

- In Example 1, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red.""
- In Example 3, which is identical to Example 1, we see the same pattern where ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red.""
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output again is a repetition of ""red.""
- In Example 4, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" and the output repeates ""yellow.""
- In Example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output repeats ""green.""

From this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" causes the immediate previous color word to be repeated in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we examine the context in which it occurs and the corresponding output:

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
2. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
3. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

In the first example, when ""walm"" is introduced, the color ""green"" is repeated.
In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and once again ""blue"" is repeated.
In the third example, ""walm"" is at the end, and the color ""yellow"" is repeated.
In the fourth and fifth examples, we see repetitions of ""yellow"" when ""walm"" is used after ""zup.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be:

walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word. 

Rule: If the preceding word has an associated color, ""walm"" causes the next output (or outputs if ""walm"" is the last word) to repeat that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""red."" The word ""wif"" correlates directly to the output ""red"" regardless of the context or position within the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, here is the rule I deduce for the meaning of ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". 

Therefore:

zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, it appears that there is a mapping between nonce words and colors. Here is the analysis:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it consistently maps to ""yellow."" 
- ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" as well, which could mean ""zup"" and ""bluf"" have the same meaning or are contextually tied to the same color output.

There is no example given in which ""zup"" and ""bluf"" appear separately and map to different colors, so the rule can't be directly inferred that they are contextually dependent on each other for the color mapping.

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word(s) three times.

In each example, the word ""walm"" causes the color denoted by the word that comes before it to be repeated thrice in the output.

Examples:
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""; ""lug"" stands for ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""; here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), and therefore ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""; ""zup"" stands for ""yellow,"" which is repeated three times after ""walm,"" and ""wif"" comes after and stands for ""red.""
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""; ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times, followed by ""wif"" (""red""), then ""dax"" again for ""green."" 

Therefore: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word(s) three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To figure out what ""lug"" means, we should look at the consistent patterns in the given examples:

- Whenever we see ""lug"" on the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- No matter where ""lug"" appears in the input, be it at the beginning, middle, or end, ""blue"" is always in the corresponding position in the output.
- ""lug"" does not seem to modify or affect the transformation of the other words, as evidenced by the consistent translation of ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green"", regardless of the presence of ""lug"".

Given these observations, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the inputs and corresponding outputs provided, we can analyze the following:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears:
  - It corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Using this information, we can construct the meaning of ""dax.""

Rule:
dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the provided examples.
zup -> rule. The rule indicates that ""zup"" means ""green"" when following the word ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" when it appears in any other context or standalone. Rule: If ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" output ""green""; otherwise, output ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns based on the input and output pairs given:

1. ""zup lug bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue""
2. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
3. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""
4. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> ""red red green blue""

- It is clear that each time ""bluf"" appears, it translates to the same color as the preceding word in the input sequence.
- ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" multiple times and each output is ""blue blue.""
- ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and the output is ""red red.""

From these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that ""bluf"" is a repeat of the color before it.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" seems consistent across all examples. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes the word ""green"". Therefore, the meaning ascribed to ""dax"" is directly linked to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

- Every occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
To understand the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look at each instance in the examples provided and the corresponding output:

1. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
   Here, ""zup"" follows three ""walm"" which corresponds to ""green"" and it changes the output from ""green"" to ""red red red yellow.""

2. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" and ""zup"" is immediately after ""wif,"" changing the output to ""yellow."" Afterwards, we have ""bluf"" and ""lug"" with consistent output colors following their first appearance.

3. lug zup -> blue yellow
   After ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" ""zup"" changes the output to ""yellow.""

4. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
   ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are consistent in their outputs, and ""zup"" follows them, changing the next output to ""yellow.""

5. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   ""lug"" and ""walm"" are consistent in output, and ""zup"" again changes the color following it to ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" changes the output color of the word that follows it to ""yellow"" regardless of what the output color would have been otherwise. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> changes the next color output to yellow
Rule: bluf -> corresponding color to the word preceding it. 

In the examples provided, ""bluf"" comes after a word that also has a corresponding color in the output. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color produced is red, which is the same color corresponding to ""wif."" When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color produced is blue, which is the color corresponding to ""lug."" Therefore, ""bluf"" means that the color to be output should be the same as the color associated with the preceding word.
Walm -> Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times. 

For example:
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" stands for blue, so ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""dax walm lug"", ""dax"" stands for green, so ""walm"" leads to ""green green green"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" is present, the output contains the word ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let us examine the inputs and corresponding outputs provided for patterns.

Looking at the examples:

- ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green."" Here, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and ""dax"" immediately follows with ""green.""
- ""zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green red."" ""zup"" is likely ""yellow,"" followed by ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and then ""wif"" as ""red.""
- ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green."" This example confirms that ""dax"" by itself means ""green.""
- ""dax lug zup dax"" shows ""green blue yellow green."" We can deduce that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" with ""dax"" flanking them as ""green.""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" with ""dax"" being ""green"" as before. The new word ""walm"" seems to also mean ""red.""

From the examples, it is clear that the consistent element is that ""dax"" always results in the word ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. No matter the position of ""wif"" in the series of words, ""red"" consistently appears in the corresponding output string. Hence, we can deduce that ""wif"" means ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given context.
Rule: bluf -> blue

The rule can be deduced by observing the consistent replacement of the nonce word ""bluf"" with ""blue"" in the outputs. Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,60

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. This is consistent across all examples provided, as each instance of ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" There are no additional context or patterns that suggest that ""dax"" changes meaning based on its position or surrounding words. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned, the output includes the color ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.
bluf -> blue followed by red. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to two colors in the output: ""blue"" followed by ""red"".
From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. Let's examine the examples to confirm this:

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" yields ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow"", which is then repeated three times in the output.

2. ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and since it precedes ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

3. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"". Similar to the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", which is then repeated three times.

4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" yields ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", resulting in ""yellow"" being output three times.

5. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" yields ""yellow green green green yellow red"". Here ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green"", which is then repeated three times.

Given this pattern, we can conclude the following rule:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,61
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the sentence. 

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following meanings for the nonce words:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Each time we see the word ""wif"" independently, the output is ""red."" Whenever ""lug"" appears with ""wif,"" before or after, it corresponds to the word ""blue."" In the case with ""zup"" before ""wif,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

This leads us to the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Every input that contains ""zup"" results in an output that includes ""yellow"". The position of ""zup"" in the sequence does not appear to affect its corresponding output, which remains unchanged regardless of other words present. The other words such as ""wif"", ""walm"", ""dax"", ""lug"", and ""bluf"" correlate with other colors (""wif"" with ""red"", ""walm"" with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""bluf"" likely also with ""yellow"" due to the last example).

zup -> meaning. Meaning is the color ""yellow"".

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output.
Rule: bluf -> the color red repeated by the number of words that precede bluf in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in your examples. We will look for a pattern or rule that applies consistently to all instances of ""walm.""

Here are the examples you provided:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Now, let's analyze the output each time ""walm"" appears:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax"" and the corresponding output colors are ""yellow green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" once again and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" without any subsequent word and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""blue green blue.""

Based on the given examples, it seems that the appearance of ""walm"" consistently results in multiple instances of a color output, and each time it results in three instances of the color that corresponds to the word that comes before ""walm."" The following color correlations can be inferred from the non-""walm"" sequences:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""bluf"" -> blue
- ""lug"" -> blue

It follows that ""walm"" causes the output of three instances of the color that precedes it:

- After ""wif"" -> three reds
- After ""lug"" -> three blues
- When between ""zup"" and ""dax"" -> we see one yellow (from ""zup"") followed by three greens (presumably from ""walm"" relating to the color ""dax"" represents, green)

Given this analysis, we can conclude:

Rule: walm -> outputs three instances of the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

So based on the given examples:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is: when preceded by a color-indicating word, ""walm"" results in three consecutive instances of the color associated with that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,62
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of context.
Given the examples provided, it seems that every instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

It is also worth noting that the other words in each input lead to specific outputs that are consistent across the examples. However, since the task is to determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we will focus on that.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Regardless of the context or surrounding words, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" means the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes just before it.
Observing the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule for the word ""walm"". Here’s what we can see:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

By examining the patterns in the input and the corresponding output, it seems that ""walm"" has the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" represents repetition of the most recent color word in the output, with the number of repetitions being one plus the number of times the color word has already appeared in the output up to that point.

Let's test this rule against our examples:

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times (since ""yellow"" appeared once, so one plus one).

2. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times (since ""blue"" appeared once, so one plus one).

3. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times (since ""red"" appeared once, so one plus one).

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Here ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is ignored, and the second ""wif"" again is ""red"". Now, ""red"" has already appeared twice, so ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three more times (since ""red"" appeared twice, so two plus one).

5. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times (since ""blue"" appeared once, so one plus one).

Therefore, walm -> meaning: Walm represents the repetition of the most recent color with the number of repetitions equalling one plus the number of times that color has appeared before ""walm"" in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,63
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" as consistently shown in all examples. When ""lug"" is combined with ""wif,"" the output includes ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif."" When ""lug"" is combined with ""dax,"" the output includes ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""
Dax -> green. Rule: Whenever the word 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the meaning can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: When the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples and the rule formation, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent across all examples provided.

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, we can deduce the following associations:

- zup corresponds to yellow
- wif corresponds to red
- dax corresponds to green
- lug corresponds to blue
- walm does not have a corresponding color but affects the following word as seen in example 4.

Now, examining the 'bluf' instances:

1. In the phrase ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" 'bluf' is followed by two 'red'. However, this rule does not hold for the second example.
2. In the phrase ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" 'bluf' comes after 'green' and is followed by another 'green.' This might suggest that 'bluf' repeats the color mentioned before it, but we need more evidence to confirm this rule.
3. In the phrase ""zup bluf,"" both 'zup' and 'bluf' correspond to 'yellow.' This supports the idea that 'bluf' repeats the preceding color.
4. In the phrase ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" 'bluf' is preceded by 'yellow' and produces 'yellow,' which consistent with the earlier observation about 'bluf.'
5. Finally, in ""lug bluf,"" both 'lug' and 'bluf' correspond to 'blue,' which fits the pattern we've observed so far.

Based on these observations, the rule for 'bluf' seems to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the preceding color.
walm -> red

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to the color red regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: blue green red red,blue green red red,True,64
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" acts as a color indicator within a sequence of non-related words that also map to colors. Each non-dax word appears to correspond to a different color, and ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green. To confirm this, we can analyze each line:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, again ""zup"" results in yellow.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" is repeated three times leading to three occurrences of yellow, indicating that one ""walm"" corresponds to one yellow. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue again.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green.
- ""dax"" leads to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue again.

Based on the pattern, each individual word translates directly to a specific color, and since ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, we can conclude that the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". This is consistent across all examples provided: whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we need to determine the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's break down the examples given:

1. ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in this scenario because ""wif"" is the preceding word and it translates as ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when following ""dax"" and when preceding ""lug"" it translates to ""yellow.""

3. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red."" Here, ""bluf"" again translates to ""green"" when following ""dax.""

4. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red,"" which further supports that ""bluf"" turns into ""red"" after ""wif.""

5. ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red,"" showing that ""bluf"" is ""blue"" after ""lug.""

From these observations, we infer the following rule that defines what ""bluf"" means based on the words that come before it:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it:
- After ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" means ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
In order to determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the provided inputs and outputs. Each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output, and our task is to match the word ""walm"" to its color representation. 

Here's the breakdown of each input relative to its output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
2. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   
3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   
4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Now, let's focus on the word ""walm"" and see which color is consistently associated with it in every output:

- In the 1st example, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"". ""zup"" is always yellow, ""dax"" is not mentioned in any other context, and ""walm"" follows a red and precedes a yellow in the output.

- In the 2nd example, ""walm"" follows and precedes ""lug"" which is blue, and the pattern around ""walm"" in the output is blue blue yellow.

- In the 3rd example, ""walm"" follows a blue and is followed by a yellow color in the output, and when it appears again, it's followed by reds which correspond to ""wif"".

- In the 4th example, ""walm"" follows a red and is followed by red(s) in the output.

- In the 5th example, again ""walm"" follows a red and is followed by red(s) in the output.

Considering the above observations, ""walm"" always corresponds to red in the output when we filter out the colors we can confidently assign to other words (such as ""lug"" = blue and ""zup"" = yellow). Therefore, based on these examples, ""walm"" represents the color red.

Rule: walm -> red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. Let's connect the outputs to each input containing ""lug"":

- ""zup dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue""
- ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue""
- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue""
- ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red red yellow red blue green""
- ""zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red""

In every instance, the placement of ""lug"" results in ""blue"" in the corresponding position in the output. 

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Each occurrence of ""dax"" results in the word ""green"" being output.

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is input, the output is ""green.""

For the input ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" which doesn't provide direct insight into what ""walm"" means since there is not enough context or examples that include ""walm"" by itself or in different combinations. It is possible that ""walm"" alone could output a single ""green,"" but we cannot conclusively deduce this from the given information. However, since ""dax"" consistently outputs ""green,"" we can confirm the rule for ""dax.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in all provided examples.
Based on the given examples, each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the words around it.

Hence, the rule is: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color that represents the word before it. Here is the mapping from the inputs to the outputs:

- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""wif"" is not followed by ""bluf"", but in the context, it seems to map to ""red""

Using this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" translates into the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, except when it follows the word ""dax,"" in which case ""walm"" translates to the color green. Here are the examples illustrated:

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green (lug translates to blue, walm repeats the color before it, and dax translates to green)
2. wif walm dax -> red red red green (wif translates to red, walm repeats the color before it, and dax translates to green)
3. dax walm -> green green green (dax translates to green, and walm repeats the color before it, but if dax is immediately followed by walm, it remains green regardless)
4. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green (zup translates to yellow, dax translates to green, and since dax is immediately followed by walm, the ""green"" repetition rule applies)
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (zup translates to yellow and walm repeats the color before it)

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color represented by the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the output is green regardless of the color ""dax"" represents.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. No matter the context or the other words present in the input, whenever the word ""wif"" is included, the output always contains the word ""red.""

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to a sequence of the word ""green"" repeated three times in the output. This pattern holds across the inputs where ""walm"" is present. Consequently, the rule observed here is that ""walm"" corresponds to the color green repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> ""green green green""

    Rules:
Lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples, regardless of its position or the words around it.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern where each unique input word corresponds to a unique output color. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the input string. Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

This can be deduced from the consistent pattern that whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. The position of ""wif"" within the input does not change its associated output to red.
Comparing the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Here is the evident correspondence of words to colors from the given examples:

- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> blue

To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we look at the positions where it occurs and the color that corresponds to it in the output:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - Here, ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" which is ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"" which is also ""red,"" but in the output, the first color is ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue green green yellow blue red""
   - In this sequence, ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and precedes ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), with ""yellow"" being the corresponding output color for ""zup.""

3. Input: ""wif dax zup wif"" -> Output: ""red green yellow red""
   - Here, ""zup"" is flanked by ""dax"" (corresponding to ""green"") and ""wif"" (corresponding to ""red""), and once again ""yellow"" is in place of ""zup"" in the output.

4. Input: ""zup lug bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue""
   - ""zup"" comes before ""lug"" (""blue"") and ""bluf"" (""blue"") in this example, resulting in ""yellow"" in the output.

5. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> Output: ""green red red red blue yellow""
   - ""zup"" follows ""lug"" (""blue"") and is the last word in the input sequence, and again, ""yellow"" represents ""zup.""

In every instance, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words adjacent to it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color of the word immediately before it

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is used in a sequence, it takes the color of the preceding word, effectively repeating that color in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The color themselves (yellow for ""zup"", green for ""dax"", blue for ""lug"", and red for ""wif"") are not directly changed by the presence of ""walm""; instead, the rule is that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that precedes it an additional two times, yielding a total of three instances of that color in a row. 

Therefore, we can define the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated two additional times, creating a sequence of three of the same color. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, output the color corresponding to that word two more times in addition to its original instance.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output each time it appears. By examining the examples and comparing inputs with their respective outputs, we can establish a pattern that correlates ""dax"" with a specific color in the output. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Considering that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in each example, it is reasonable to deduce that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the correlation of the word's appearance in various positions within the input sequences and the resulting output colors.

In the input examples where ""wif"" is present, the corresponding output is consistently ""red,"" regardless of the position of ""wif"" or the surrounding words.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Input: lug wif zup wif
Output: blue red yellow red

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

In every instance, ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, indicating that the word ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
From the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color that directly follows it. The color it represents seems to depend on the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"". Let's verify this rule through the examples:

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow red red yellow"". ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the ""bluf"" entry yields two ""red"" outputs.

In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" as well, and again we see ""yellow"" followed by two ""red"" outputs. 

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows both ""lug"" and ""zup,"" and in both cases, it results in two repeats of the color related to the word that precedes ""bluf"" (""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""zup"" -> ""yellow"").

In the fourth example, there's only one instance of ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" and as before, ""yellow"" is followed by ""yellow"".

Lastly, in the fifth example, there are two ""green"" outputs following ""dax bluf,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" yields a double occurrence of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and the corresponding outputs to identify patterns:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
4. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Firstly, it appears that each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that precedes it:

- In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and we get ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and we get ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and we get ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Secondly, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color word exactly three times:

- The examples consistently show a triplet of the same color following the word ""walm.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated three times.

Walm -> meaning: When encountered, repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow red,True,69
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. By examining the consistent appearance of the word ""lug"" across all the examples and noting that it always corresponds to the output ""blue,"" we can deduce:

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. ""dax"" appears to correspond to a specific color each time it is used.
2. ""dax"" does not correspond to the same color as any of the directly adjacent words.
3. In every instance, ""dax"" is translated as ""green.""

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" represents the color green regardless of the context or sequence of the words. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Here are the deduced associations between the input and the output words:
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue

Now, in every example where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is always ""red"":

- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (lug is blue, wif is red)
- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow (walm is red, dax is green, zup is yellow, and wif is red)
- Input: wif dax zup wif -> Output: red green yellow red (dax is green, zup is yellow, and both instances of wif are red)

So, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

wif -> meaning: red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: In each example, regardless of context, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
Rule: The word `bluf` translates to the word ""blue"". In each given input-output example, wherever the word `bluf` appears, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
Rule: walm -> repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" three times. 

For instance:
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" represents red, so ""walm"" becomes ""red red red.""
- In ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" represents yellow, so ""walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" represents blue, so ""walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,70
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" is used, the output is consistently ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's look at the patterns and compare each input with its respective output:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
3. ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green.""
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red.""
5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red green green red blue.""

In every occurrence, irrespective of position, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"" in the output. The surrounding words lead to different colors, but ""dax"" does not seem to be influenced by them. Therefore, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a certain color that has to do with its position in the input sequence. If we analyze the sequences in which ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output, we can attempt to discern a pattern to deduce the meaning of ""wif.""

In the first input sequence ""wif dax bluf,"" the word ""wif"" leads to the output ""red."" In the second sequence, ""dax wif dax,"" ""wif"" is again associated with ""red."" The third sequence ""zup bluf wif walm"" gives us ""red red red"" for the ""wif walm"" part, and the fourth sequence ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red"" for ""wif."" Finally, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" associates ""wif"" with ""red"" once again.

From these examples, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

So, we can conclude:

wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""wif"" means ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following correspondence for the word ""zup"" and other words:

- Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

None of the examples contradict these associations, as they are consistently applied across all examples. We can therefore induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

This means that, within the context of this problem, the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> red

Rule: The word bluf translates to the color red regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems like the word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Let's analyze the examples to understand better:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red."" Here, ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows it, ""walm"" results in repeating ""blue"" twice more. Then ""wif"" ends the sequence with ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue."" The same rule applies; ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" so ""walm"" repeats it twice more.

3. In the third example, ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red."" ""Lug"" outputs ""blue,"" ""wif"" changes to ""red,"" and ""walm"" then repeats the color of the word just before it, which is ""red,"" three times.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" ""Zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" (the color of ""zup"") twice, ""dax"" is ""green,"" another ""zup"" continues with ""yellow,"" followed by ""dax"" again with ""green,"" and finally ""wif"" changes to ""red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup walm dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Again, ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" (the color of ""zup"") twice, and ""dax"" is ""green.""

From these observations, we can infer the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeats the output color of the word immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Regardless of other words' presence or position in the input sequence, ""wif"" always results in ""red"" in the output. This is observed in all examples given, including when ""wif"" appears at the beginning, middle, or end of an input string. Therefore, we can conclude the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output at the position that corresponds to the position of ""wif"" in the input.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output language. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, a single ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the examples you provided, we can infer the following:

- The output color does not depend on the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

- The color associated with ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that immediately precedes it:

    - When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" (examples 1, 2, and 5), the output color for ""bluf"" is green.
    - When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" (examples 1 and 3), the output color for ""bluf"" is red.
    - When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" (example 4), the output color for ""bluf"" is blue.

- In example 5, despite ""zup"" and ""wif"" appearing before ""walm,"" the output color is not influenced by these words when ""walm"" is present. This suggests ""walm"" does not inherit its associated color from preceding words.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" acts as a mirror or duplicator for the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color output of the word preceding it.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to affect the output by repeating the last color mentioned before it, three times.

Here's the analysis:

- In the first input ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" is green and ""lug"" is blue. After ""walm"" is mentioned, ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the second input ""lug walm wif"", ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""walm"" which outputs ""blue"" three times. Then ""wif"" is red.
- The third input ""zup bluf wif walm"" has ""zup"" for yellow, ""bluf"" for yellow, ""wif"" for red, then ""walm"" repeats the last color ""red"" three times.
- The fourth input ""lug zup dax walm"" has ""lug"" for blue, ""zup"" for yellow, ""dax"" for green, and then ""walm"" repeats the last color ""green"" three times.
- The fifth input ""wif lug walm"" has ""wif"" for red, ""lug"" for blue, and then ""walm"" repeats the last color ""blue"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned before it, three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words present in the input.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is produced in the corresponding position in the output.
Rule: bluf -> the color that corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it.

Explanation:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output for ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" also outputs green.
  
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" outputs red.
  
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" outputs blue.
  
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and then later follows ""zup."" The outputs for ""wif"" and ""zup"" are red and yellow, respectively, and ""bluf"" takes on the colors red and yellow in that order following the words it replicates.
Based on the examples provided, walm seems to be an indicator that the subsequent colors should be repeated based on the most recent color mentioned. Here's the pattern I observed:

- After ""lug walm"", blue is repeated three times.
- In the second example, after ""dax zup walm"", yellow is repeated three times before wif (red).
- In the third and fourth examples, after ""dax walm"", green is repeated thrice, indicating that walm causes the repetition of the color that was last mentioned.
- In the last example, after ""zup bluf wif walm"", red is repeated three times.

So, it seems that the rule is as follows:

Rule: walm causes the color output that directly precedes it to be repeated three times.

walm -> causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

The rest of the output colors do not show a consistent pattern with respect to ""lug."" Here are the correlations with the provided inputs:

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to the first ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to the last ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to the fourth ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of context.
Based on the given examples, each word (zup, lug, dax, walm, bluf) corresponds to a color (yellow, blue, green, yellow, red). 

The word ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" is consistent and does not depend on context within these examples.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" aligning with the previous example.

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Here, the presence of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") translates to ""yellow"" again, which is not consistent with the previous examples if we consider ""bluf"" to always correspond to ""blue."" It suggests ""bluf"" could mean repeating the previous color if it's preceded by ""zup.""

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is a repeat of the previous color, ""dax"" (green).

Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" again, which is a repeat of the color that directly precedes it, ""wif"" (red).

Based on all these examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word in a sequence and has no color to take from a previous word, there is not enough information given to determine what color it should be.

Hence, the rule induction for ""bluf"" is:
bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. Rule: walm means to repeat the last color mentioned one or more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs provided.
Based on the provided examples, the word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green'. Each input line starts with the word 'dax' and is immediately followed by 'green' in the output, regardless of the other words that follow. This pattern indicates that 'dax' corresponds directly to 'green'. 

However, looking at the other words, there seems to be a pattern to their meanings as well. For instance, 'wif' outputs 'red' consistently, 'zup' outputs 'yellow', 'bluf' outputs 'blue', and there appears to be no direct translation provided for 'walm' or 'lug,' although 'walm' is consistently followed by 'green' in the output which could mean that 'walm' has the same meaning as 'dax' or it may follow another rule that hasn't been elucidated with the given examples. 'Lug' doesn't have a consistent output, making it difficult to deduce its meaning with the given data.

Rule:
dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Wif translates to the color red regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given example.
From the given examples, we can deduce that each regular word corresponds to a color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> blue (inferred from example 4 where ""lug walm"" both lead to blue)

The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example it is used. Thus, using these observations, we can state the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the rule underlying the problem seems to be a direct mapping between the nonce word ""dax"" and the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output contains the color ""green."" This pattern holds regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" No context is given where ""zup"" takes on a different meaning or where it depends on the surrounding words to alter its representation. It appears to be an invariant mapping onto the color yellow, regardless of its position within the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf means to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.
walm -> a color repeated three times. Rule: The specific color is determined by the word that precedes walm. 'lug' corresponds to blue, 'dax' to green, 'zup' to yellow, and 'wif' to red. Each instance of 'walm' is replaced by three repetitions of the corresponding color.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in an input, the output includes the color ""blue"" at its respective position. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green.

Whenever the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is used in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output, regardless of the other words around it.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can see that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The rule seems straightforward, as ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of its position relative to other words in the inputs. Given this consistent mapping, the induction of the rule is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To decipher the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and the outputs.

Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
Input: wif bluf lug | Output: red red blue
Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow

When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" could repeat the color associated with the word right before it (since ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in all instances).

When ""bluf"" is preceded by different words such as ""zup"" and ""wif,"" it again outputs the color associated with the preceding words twice. In both ""zup wif bluf"" and ""wif bluf lug,"" the presence of ""wif"" results in ""red red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it, in a double pattern.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word twice.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to determine the color mentioned just before it to be repeated three times in the output. Let's verify this pattern:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, the last part ""zup walm"" also turns into ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again with ""zup"" preceding ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" is translated to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" precedes ""walm""
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" and the part ""zup walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" precedes ""walm.""

From these examples, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be outputted three times consecutively.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Here is the rule induction based on the examples provided:

- Whenever ""zup"" is present as an input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position of the output.
- The other words seem to correspond to a specific color as well, as ""lug"" always results in ""blue,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- The repeated use of ""walm"" in the examples where it is followed by another color-word, like ""wif"" or ""dax,"" does not change the output color for those words, so it's possible ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" too.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with repeating the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"". Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" after ""dax"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- In the second example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red red blue yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated due to ""bluf"".
- Similarly, in the third and fourth examples, the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that 'walm' matches the color output of the word immediately preceding it. Thus, when 'walm' follows 'dax,' the color is green, as 'dax' corresponds to green. When 'walm' follows 'zup,' the color is yellow, as 'zup' corresponds to yellow. 

Rule: walm -> same color as the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True,78
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
To deduce the meaning or rule associated with the word ""dax"", let's examine the word's occurrence in every example and the corresponding output:

In all instances where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".

- Input: dax
  Output: green
  
This gives us a direct correlation that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Now let's check to see if this holds true in all the other examples where ""dax"" is combined with other words:

- Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
  Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
  
Here ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output following ""green"" is ""red"", suggesting that the word following ""dax"" doesn't affect its output.

- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green blue blue blue
  
""Dax"" is at the beginning and results in ""green"". Subsequent words are ""lug"" and ""walm"", which output blue, reinforcing that ""dax"" has no impact on the following words' outputs.

- Input: dax wif
  Output: green red
  
""Dax"" leads to ""green"", and ""wif"" outputs ""red"". Again, there's no change to the pattern due to them being adjacent.

- Input: wif dax zup dax
  Output: red green yellow green
  
In this sequence, ""wif"" produces ""red"", followed by ""dax"" which results in ""green"". ""Zup"" gives ""yellow"", and another ""dax"" yields ""green"" again. The presence of ""wif"" before ""dax"" or ""zup"" between two instances of ""dax"" does not alter the output of ""dax"", which continues to be ""green"".

Given that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Each time the word ""wif"" appears, it translates to the color ""red."" Other words such as ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" convert to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively, but the constant factor for ""wif"" is that it is always followed by or associated with the color ""red.""
Given the examples provided, it appears that 'zup' corresponds to a particular color. The translation of 'zup' is consistent across the examples provided, regardless of the words that come before or after it in the input.

In each instance, 'zup' is translated to 'yellow':

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears twice, and both times it's translated to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" appears at the beginning and is also translated as ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" but ""zup"" independently translates to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is again translated to ""yellow"" regardless of the surrounding words.
- In the fifth example, even paired with ""bluf,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" ""zup"" maintains its meaning of ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> ""repeat the previous word's color"".

In the outputs, whenever the word ""bluf"" is mentioned, the color of the previous word is repeated without adding an additional color for ""bluf"" itself. Therefore, ""bluf"" appears to instruct the system to repeat the color of the word that came just before it. 

For example, in the second input ""wif bluf lug,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the appearance of ""bluf"" right after it results in another ""red"" in the output without a new color for ""bluf"" itself. Then ""lug"" adds ""blue"" to the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and output for each example.

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""wif"" is followed by three ""red,"" it seems that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Following the previous deduction, ""walm"" again appears to correspond to ""blue.""

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and again ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" isn't followed by an output, leading to the assumption that it might be another form of the word ""blue."" The occurrence of three ""yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" this time, which breaks the previous pattern.

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Here ""walm"" seems to result in the doubling of ""blue"" in the output.

Upon closer analysis, it becomes clear that the meaning of ""walm"" can't be directly assigned to a single color as previously thought. Instead, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it duplicates the color word that appears just before it. This is consistent across the examples in the list, where the color word before ""walm"" is repeated in the output.

Rule: walm -> a rule that duplicates the output color associated with the word appearing immediately before it in the input.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue' across all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green 

Each occurrence of the nonce word 'dax' corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
Examining the given examples:

- Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green
- Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow

The word ""zup"" produces the output ""yellow"" in every example. It's not dependent on its position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it. Thus, the rule seems to be quite straightforward.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The rule can be observed as follows:

1. ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue,"" hence ""bluf"" has duplicated the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).
2. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" has duplicated the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).
3. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" has duplicated the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).
4. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" hence ""bluf"" has duplicated the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
5. ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green,"" hence ""bluf"" has duplicated the color associated with ""dax"" (green).

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word right before it and duplicates it.
walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color output associated with that preceding word is produced three times. For example, if ""wif"" (which outputs ""red"") is followed by ""walm,"" the output will be ""red red red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in each provided example, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the patterns that emerge before and after its use:

1. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
2. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
3. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
4. ""zup dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow green red yellow""
5. ""wif zup wif dax"" -> ""red yellow red green""

Here are some observations:

- When ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" always follows in the output.
- The word before ""wif"" does not seem to influence the ""red"" output consistently, suggesting that ""wif"" independently contributes to this.
- The word ""wif"" does not correlate with any color output other than ""red"", reinforcing the idea of a specific association.
- Other words do seem to have consistent mappings:
  - ""lug"" -> ""blue"" (seen in both examples containing ""lug"")
  - ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" (seen consistently every time ""zup"" is present)
  - ""dax"" -> ""green"" (seen in both examples containing ""dax"")

Given these patterns, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context within the given examples.
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" I will examine each input/output pair to identify patterns and associations with the word ""bluf."" Since ""bluf"" always appears in the input and there is a consistent presence of the color ""red"" in the second position of the output, it is likely that ""bluf"" is associated with the color red.

Here are the associations for each example:

1. Input: dax zup bluf => Output: green yellow yellow
2. Input: wif bluf lug zup => Output: red red blue yellow
3. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug => Output: yellow yellow red green blue
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm => Output: red red green green green
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup => Output: red red blue yellow

Looking at the pattern, ""bluf"" is consistently followed by ""red"" in the output. The other words in the input seem to correspond to different colors in the output, but ""bluf"" consistently maps to red. Furthermore, each time ""bluf"" appears in the input list, ""red"" appears in the exact position following the word ""bluf"" in the output list, regardless of ""bluf"" position in the input.

Rule: bluf -> red

The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color red.
Analyzing the given examples and their respective outputs, let's look at the relationship between the inputs and outputs to determine the meaning of ""walm.""

Here are the examples rewritten with their corresponding color outputs for clarity:

1. wif (red) bluf (red) dax (green) bluf (green) wif (red) walm (red) lug (blue) wif (red)
2. wif (red) walm (red) (red)
3. wif (red) zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) lug (blue) walm (blue) dax (green) lug (blue)
4. lug (blue) wif (red) walm (red) (red)
5. zup (yellow) walm (yellow) (yellow) lug (blue)

Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the previous color in the sequence.

Rule: 
walm -> Repeat the previous color in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,81
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the consistent output for the input ""zup"" is the word ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule for what ""zup"" means in these examples is straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue, if preceded by ""lug""; red, if preceded by ""wif""; green, if preceded by ""dax""; yellow if preceded by ""zup"".

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue. If it follows ""wif,"" the output is red. Following ""dax"" results in green, and when it comes after ""zup,"" the output is yellow.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a rule in which the previously mentioned color is repeated for a given number of times.

From the examples:

- Example 1 has ""wif walm,"" which translates to ""red red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" means to repeat the previous color three times.
- Example 2 has ""lug walm zup,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue,"" and again, the previous color (blue) is repeated three times.
- Example 3 has ""dax walm,"" which translates to ""green green green,"" and once again, ""walm"" makes the previous color (green) repeat three times.
- Example 4 has ""wif walm,"" which translates to ""red red red,"" adhering to the repetition rule.
- Example 5 has ""lug walm wif,"" which results in ""blue blue blue,"" showing the previous color (blue) repeated three times before a color change occurs.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: ""Repeat the previous color mentioned three times.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided input and output examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""lug"".

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" as well, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"".

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" or ""blue"" depending on repetition, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be consistent:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""green."" Therefore, we can conclude that in this context ""dax"" means green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a particular color in the output. Here is the analysis:

- ""wif"" appears before another word, and in the output, ""red"" always follows. This is evident because every time ""wif"" is mentioned, regardless of the word that comes after it, ""red"" is in the corresponding place in the output.

- The word after ""wif"" corresponds to another color:
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  - ""bluf"" results in ""red,"" both in input and output.
  - ""walm"" leads to triple ""yellow"" or ""green.""

Now let's look at the word ""wif"" in each case:

1. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
2. Input: wif dax zup walm -> Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
4. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
5. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

From these examples, ""wif"" consistently correlates to ""red"" in the output. However, the word following ""wif"" also contributes to the output sequence, generating the color that corresponds to that word.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". The position of ""zup"" in the sequence does not affect its output, as it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of where it is situated amongst other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

It appears that each word translates to a specific color. Here are the translations we can infer:

- dax = green
- lug = blue
- wif = red
- zup = yellow

With these translations, we can see that wherever ""bluf"" appears, it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it:

1. dax bluf -> green green (bluf takes the color of dax)
2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue (bluf takes the color of lug)
3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red (bluf takes the color of dax)
4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green (1st bluf takes the color of lug; 2nd bluf takes the color of zup)
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow (bluf takes the color of wif)

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: When walm follows another word, the output is the color corresponding to the preceding word, repeated three times. The colors corresponding to other words used in the examples are as follows: lug -> blue, dax -> green, zup -> yellow, wif -> red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,83
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

This is deduced as follows:

- In every input, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
- There is no indication that ""dax"" is dependent on position or other context, as it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the words around it.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the color ""red"" in the outputs. It doesn't seem to matter what the context is; ""wif"" always leads to the same output color. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, I will first identify the patterns:

1. When 'zup' is preceded by 'dax', the output is yellow.
2. When 'zup' is preceded by 'lug', the output is yellow.
3. When 'zup' is preceded by 'bluf', the output is yellow.
4. When 'zup' stands alone or is not preceded by any word that has been shown previously, the output is yellow.
5. When 'zup' follows 'dax', regardless of what follows 'zup', the output is still yellow.

From these patterns, we see that 'zup' consistently outputs yellow regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf"" within this context, let's analyze the pairs of input and output. Below, we will list each unique word and their corresponding color based on the output if it's consistent:

- dax -> green (consistent in examples 1 and 5)
- zup -> yellow (consistent in all examples it appears)
- lug -> blue (consistent in examples 3 and 4)
- wif -> red (consistent in example 2)

Now let's look at ""bluf"" in each example:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
4. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
5. zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green

Considering the context and the patterns observed in the output, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it. In every instance of ""bluf,"" the color that follows in the output matches the color associated with the word before ""bluf"". For example, in the first input ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green."" This pattern holds true in all other examples provided.

Rule: bluf -> replicates the color of the preceding word.
To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the translations from the examples. One way to approach this is by identifying the consistent outcome whenever ""walm"" appears.

In the first example, after ""walm"" is introduced, the sequence ""blue blue blue"" follows regardless of what comes before it.

In the second example, ""dax walm zup"" gives us ""green green green yellow."" Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" consistently, we can infer that ""dax walm"" is responsible for ""green green green.""

Similarly, in the third example, after ""walm,"" we again see ""blue blue blue"" until a new word (""wif"") introduces a change (""red"").

In the fourth example, where ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" once again translates into a triple repetition of the color that came before it.

In the fifth example, where ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" again we see ""blue blue blue.""

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color word immediately preceding it three times. If we infer that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and the pattern holds, ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it and repeats that color three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the other words present in the input.
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Every single input that contains the word ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that each nonce word corresponds to a color in the output sequence:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

The output sequence follows the order of the input nonce words with their respective color translations.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned, the output includes ""yellow."" Here is the correlation with the given inputs and outputs:

Input: zup walm lug wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
Input: zup dax | Output: yellow green
Input: zup lug wif | Output: yellow blue red
Input: lug zup | Output: blue yellow
Input: zup lug | Output: yellow blue

From the above, it's clear that regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, it results in ""yellow"" in the output sequence. The position of ""zup"" has no impact on the meaning in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Given the examples, we can see that ""bluf"" seems to change its meaning depending on the word that comes before it. Here is the pattern I have found:

- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" the output is ""blue""
- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" the output is ""green""
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" the output is ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" but doesn't seem to directly influence the meaning of ""bluf""; rather, it retains its own translation of ""red""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word before it.
walm -> repeat the previously mentioned color. 
Rule: When the word 'walm' appears after a color-denoting word, the output is the color mentioned before 'walm' repeated as many times as 'walm' appears consecutively.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of ""lug"" in the input directly corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the outputs associated with the inputs where ""wif"" appears:

1. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""
2. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
3. ""wif"" -> ""red""
4. ""wif"" -> ""red""
5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""

In the first example, ""wif"" appears twice and contributes ""red"" to the output sequence each time. No matter what other words precede or follow ""wif,"" its presence consistently results in the output ""red."" The other words in the input (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf"") correspond to different colors in the output.

In the second, third, and fourth examples, ""wif"" either appears alone or at the beginning of the input, and in all cases, the output is ""red.""

The fifth example further confirms this pattern: regardless of position, when ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""red.""

Thus, based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" by looking at the patterns in the input and their corresponding output.

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   Here ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" (blue) and corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" (blue) again and corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. Input: zup lug wif
   Output: yellow blue red
   Here ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" and corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Here ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""yellow"".

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Here ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow"".

Taken together, regardless of the word that follows ""zup"" or the word that it follows, the output color for ""zup"" is always ""yellow"". No other words in the examples provided consistently correspond with the color yellow in the output. Hence, we can conclude the rule for ""zup"" based on the given examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule:
Bluf -> ""Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before bluf in the sequence"". 

For instance, in ""dax bluf wif"", dax is associated with the color green, and so bluf takes the color green from ""dax."" In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" wif is associated with red, so bluf takes the color red. This rule holds for the examples provided.
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word. 

From the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in the output sequence. Here's how:

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated.
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" is associated with green, and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated; similarly, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated.
- In the third example, ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The ""walm"" word here causes the preceding color, ""red,"" to be repeated before moving on to ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated without any new word following to indicate a change in color.

Thus, the rule induced is that ""walm"" requires the preceding color to be repeated in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the word ""blue"" in the output.
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by examining the output associated with ""dax"" in different contexts:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green

In this case, dax alone translates to green.

2. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

Here, ""dax"" is followed by other words and each word seems to have its own color associated with it. ""Dax"" still translates to green, ""walm"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow.

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

When ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" each retains its color, with ""zup"" as yellow and ""dax"" as green.

4. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

In this input, ""wif"" translates to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue. It's worth noting that ""walm"" changes to blue, which indicates that ""walm""'s color might be context-dependent or that there is an additional rule at play that affects its output.

5. Input: dax lug dax
   Output: green blue green

In this sequence, ""dax"" remains consistently green, regardless of its position. ""Lug"" is blue, which is consistent with input 4.

Based on these observations, the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be consistent throughout the examples, always translating to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

We can see that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"", as shown in every example where it appears. In the context of these examples, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word. The color repeats three times if ""walm"" is the last word, or it repeats as many times as there are words following ""walm."" Here's how the rule applies to each example:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule: Repeat ""green"" three times, since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
Rule: Repeat ""blue"" three times followed by the color corresponding to ""wif.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Rule: Start with ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" follow with ""red"" for ""wif,"" then repeat ""red"" three times due to ""walm.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: Repeat ""yellow"" three times, since ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Rule: Start with ""green"" for ""dax,"" then ""blue"" for ""lug,"" and repeat ""blue"" three times because of ""walm.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a word that corresponds to a color, repeat the color of the preceding word three times if ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence. If ""walm"" is followed by other words, repeat the color for as many times as there are words after ""walm"" before continuing with the colors corresponding to the following words.

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times if it is the last word in the sequence, or as many times as there are following words if there are any.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning or rules associated with the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the given examples.

In each output sequence, ""green"" represents a correct position and element; ""yellow"" signifies the correct element but in the wrong position; and ""red"" indicates a wrong element.

Now, let's see how these colors map to the word ""dax"" in the examples:

1. In the first input, ""dax walm zup"" maps to ""green green green yellow."" We notice that ""dax"" maps to ""green"", which suggests it is correct in position and element.

2. In the second input, ""dax zup walm wif"" maps to ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" Here again ""dax"" receives a ""green"", meaning correct position and element. 

3. The third input, ""dax zup wif,"" results in ""green yellow red,"" which again shows ""dax"" as ""green"" for the correct element and position.
   
4. The fourth input, ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" gives us ""green green red yellow red."" Still, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, the position of ""dax"" has changed, it is now the third element in the sequence ""wif walm dax zup."" This input gives us ""red red red green yellow,"" indicating that ""dax"" is no longer in the correct position but still the correct element.

If we assess the pattern, ""dax"" is consistently mapped to ""green"" when it is the first element, indicating that ""dax"" is correctly placed at the beginning of the sequence. However, when ""dax"" is in any other position (as seen in example 5), it maps to ""yellow"" (correct element but wrong position) or ""red"" (entirely incorrect) depending on its positioning and the other words in the sequence.

Based on the inputs and outputs, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be that it must be placed at the beginning of the sequence to be considered correctly positioned. When ""dax"" is in the correct position (at the start), everything that follows is evaluated for being in the correct or incorrect position (green or yellow), and if an element is not included in the correct sequence at all, it is marked as red.

Rule: dax -> must be at the beginning of the sequence to be correct (green). If it is placed elsewhere, it does not conform to the rule and does not receive a green.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following relationships between the input words and the output colors:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""lug"" also consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red.""

In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red."" Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""wif"" is consistent across all examples.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the following mapping seems to be consistent:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> yellow

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and to ""blue"" otherwise. Here's the breakdown of examples given and the contexts in which ""bluf"" appears:

1. wif bluf -> red
2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue
3. dax zup bluf -> yellow
4. zup bluf -> yellow
5. wif bluf zup -> red

Since there is only one instance that could lead to a rule where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red,"" and in all other instances ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" I propose the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it immediately follows ""wif."" In all other contexts, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue."" 

Hence, the meaning of ""bluf"" is:
bluf -> ""red"" when following ""wif,"" otherwise ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

1. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green.
2. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output color is red.
3. The term ""walm"" is not directly associated with a specific color output on its own.

Given that the color outputs change in accordance with the word preceding ""walm,"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" seems to function as a repeater or duplicator of the output color associated with the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Hence,

walm -> functions as a color repeater/duplicator depending on the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sentence or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule can be described as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Thus, the rule is:
wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the appearance of the word ""zup"" in an input sequence corresponds to the output of the color ""yellow"". In every instance, regardless of where ""zup"" is placed in the sequence or what other words are involved, ""yellow"" is consistently produced in the output sequence. 

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a doubling of the color associated with the previous word. Each unique word (wif, lug, zup, dax) translates to a specific color (red, blue, yellow, green), and when the word ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated twice.

Here is the rule:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"" twice.

Rule: bluf -> Double the previous color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the examples, we need to identify a pattern in the input that could correspond to the output, keeping in mind the placement and context of ""walm"".

In the first example:
Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

In the second example:
Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

In the third example:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

In the fourth example:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

In the fifth example:
Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Looking closely:
- Whenever ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" the output before ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""dax"" comes after ""walm,"" the output after ""walm"" is ""green.""
- The position of ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- The output color sequence following ""walm"" matches the color that represents the word immediately following ""walm.""
- The color that precedes ""walm"" in the output depends on the word that precedes ""walm"" in the input.

Hence, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that precedes it thrice, followed by the color that corresponds to the word that comes after it (if there is a word after ""walm"").

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" in the context of these examples means to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times and then follow it with the color associated with the immediately succeeding word, if there is one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue."" There is no variation in output for ""lug"" across different inputs, so we can infer a straightforward meaning.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Analyzing the examples given, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. The output does not seem context-dependent in relation to the position of ""wif""; it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Even when ""wif"" appears alone in the input, the output is ""red.""

Therefore, the rule induced from the given examples is:

wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Moreover, there doesn't appear to be a contextual dependency; ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position among other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf corresponds to the color red.
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the Input three times in the Output. Given that the outputs are just repetitions of colors, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to represent the instruction to repeat the color that comes before it three times.

Here is how ""walm"" functions in each example provided:

- In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and then ""walm"" follows, which results in ""green green green."" 
- In ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, then ""walm"" follows, resulting in ""blue blue blue""; similarly, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, then ""walm"" follows, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, and then ""walm"" follows, which gives ""red red red.""
- Similarly, in ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Based on the provided examples, it appears that each instance of ""wif"" correlates directly to the output of ""red."" This is consistent across all examples, regardless of the other words present or their respective colors. Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning or rule behind the use of the nonce word ""zup."" To do this, let's analyze the relationship between the input and the output in each example:

Example 1:
Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Example 2:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Example 3:
Input: lug zup wif
Output: blue yellow red

Example 4:
Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

Example 5:
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Observing the examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, a ""yellow"" appears in the output in the corresponding position. This indicates that ""zup"" likely translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be defined as: zup -> yellow.
From the example inputs and outputs provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with the color that immediately follows its mention. To confirm this, let's examine each example:

1. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" appears twice and each time it is followed by the color that was mentioned just before it (""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively).

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" is the same color that ""zup"" represents (""yellow"").

3. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" again echoes the color that was mentioned just before it (""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively).

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
   - ""bluf"" takes the color from ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""bluf"" takes the color from ""wif"" which is ""red"".

Based on the observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. So the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the immediately preceding word
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition of the color that is associated with the word that precedes it. The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""lug"" appears to be consistent across all examples. Wherever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. This pattern holds true regardless of the other words present or their corresponding outputs. 

Thus, the rule is: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word 'dax' translates to the color 'green'.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" However, for the other words, we have ""wif"" associated with a single red and ""walm"" associated with repeating the color red for as many times as the letters in the word (walm = red red red red), and ""dax"" associated with green. Therefore:

Rule:
- ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" means ""red.""
- ""walm"" means ""red"" repeated for each letter in ""walm.""
- ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" is repeated the same number of times as the word immediately preceding it, and it takes the color associated with that preceding word. The rule is consistent across all provided examples:

- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and there is one ""bluf"" after it, which turns into one ""yellow.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red"" as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and it is immediately followed by one ""bluf,"" which becomes one additional ""red.""
- ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" follows the same pattern with ""bluf"" taking the color of the word right before it and being repeated the same number of times. In this case, ""zup bluf"" turns into ""yellow yellow"" and ""lug bluf"" turns into ""blue blue."" Moreover, the sequence ends with ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and that is followed by one ""bluf,"" turning into one ""red.""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" which is again immediately followed by one ""bluf,"" translating into an additional ""red.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" follows the examples above, with ""wif bluf"" turning into ""red red.""

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word that precedes it and appears the same number of times as that word appears immediately before it.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each input-output pair to identify patterns:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""
2. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
4. ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of walm in the input and their respective outputs:

- In inputs 1, 2, and 5, ""walm"" appears at the end. In the corresponding output, the color of the word appearing just before ""walm"" is repeated three times.
- In input 3, ""walm"" is directly following ""lug,"" and in the output, ""blue"" is repeated three times, reflecting the color associated with ""lug.""
- In input 4, ""walm"" appears twice, once directly after ""lug"" and once after ""zup."" In the output, the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow) are each repeated three times following the same order.

Based on the above observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word in the output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the input and corresponding output examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Here's the reasoning:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output sequence starts with ""yellow red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output sequence starts with ""red yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output sequence is ""red red.""
- When ""lug"" is surrounded by ""wif"" in the sequence ""lug wif lug wif,"" the output sequence is ""blue red blue red,"" with ""red"" always following ""wif.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output sequence is ""red blue.""

These examples suggest that regardless of the context, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the output sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output at the position corresponding to where zup appeared in the input.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each instance it appears and its corresponding output.

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" seen in other inputs.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" seen in other inputs.
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and we have ""yellow green.""

2. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
   - We've established ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""
   - Since ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"" and follows ""wif,"" we could assume ""bluf"" takes on the color that precedes it.

3. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and outputs another ""green,"" which may support our assumption.
   - ""wif"" is ""red"" as identified from earlier examples.
   - ""dax"" consistently corresponds with ""green.""

4. ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red"" again, matching our assumption.
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" which remains consistent.

5. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""
   - ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" which we've seen previously.
   - ""bluf"" follows the second ""wif,"" and corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""
   - The pattern remains consistent.

Based on the above analysis, we can infer that ""bluf"" is a rule that takes on the color of the word preceding it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""zup"", but if ""walm"" follows it, ""dax"" changes to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

The word ""walm"" appears to change the color of any word that precedes it to ""red"" with the exception of ""zup"". When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the color remains ""yellow"".

The rule that seems to be consistent with the examples given is:

Rule: If ""walm"" follows any word except ""zup"", change the output color of the preceding word(s) to ""red"". If ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", ""zup"" remains ""yellow"".

Therefore:
walm -> Changes preceding word outputs to ""red"", except for ""zup"" which remains ""yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example, regardless of the context or position in the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates to a specific color when used in conjunction with other words. By examining the consistent patterns, it's possible to deduce the meaning of ""wif.""

Looking at each usage of ""wif"" and its corresponding output color:

- In the first example, when ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is both preceded by and followed by ""dax,"" and both instances produce ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" and the output is ""red yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" and the output is ""yellow red green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red.""

From these examples, we can assume that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is true regardless of whether ""wif"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence. Each time ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is the associated output.

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently correlates to the output ""yellow."" It does not matter whether ""zup"" appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the input; the output consistently includes the color ""yellow"" in the position corresponding to ""zup."" Hence, we deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""bluf"" means repeating the color mentioned before it.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is the same color word repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns associated with each input and output pair:

- In the first example, each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. ""walm wif"" gives ""green red,"" meaning ""walm"" makes the next word generate the same color as the previous word (green).
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" which output ""red green"" and ""blue blue,"" respectively. This reinforces the deduction from the first example—a repeat in color from the previous word.
- The third example shows ""wif walm dax"" leading to ""red red red green,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the next word, ""dax,"" to repeat the color of ""wif"" (red).
- The fourth example, ""wif walm,"" results in ""red red red,"" again implying the repetition of ""wif's"" color in place of ""walm.""
- Lastly, the fifth example, ""dax walm,"" outputs ""green green green."" Like before, ""walm” is repeating the output color of ""dax.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it causes the next word to repeat the output color of the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

Therefore: walm -> Causes the next word's assigned color to repeat the previous word's color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,94
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
The examples provided offer a consistent representation of color words following the nonce word ""lug"" as well as other nonce words. The word ""lug"" appears to directly translate to the color ""blue"". The other nonce words translate as follows: ""bluf"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""dax"" -> green, and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color directly preceding it.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green. 

Following the pattern in the examples given, every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" Whether ""dax"" is used alone or in combination with other words, it consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each specific input word corresponds with a unique color in the output.

Here are the associations based on the provided data:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> green green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red

Given that in every example where the word ""wif"" is used, the color ""red"" is part of the output, we can induce that the word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"". Additionally, when ""wif"" is presented on its own, the output is a single ""red"", confirming this association.

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule I deduce is:
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is used in an input sequence, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
bluf -> the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: If a color word (lug, wif, zup, dax) precedes the word bluf, then bluf takes on the meaning of that color word's corresponding color. Specifically, lug equals blue, wif equals red, zup equals yellow, and dax equals green. So bluf repeats the color of the word directly before it.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color (in English) that immediately precedes it. To establish this, let's examine the patterns:

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is translated as ""red"", and therefore ""walm"" results in repeated ""red"".
  
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.

- In the third example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" is translated to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". The ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"", thus ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". Each ""walm"" follows a color (first ""green"", then ""blue"") and repeats it three times.

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which is ""blue"", leading to a triple ""blue"".

Rule: walm-> meaning. ""walm"" means the repetition of the prior mentioned color three times.

Hence, the rule is: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, it repeats the color that word represents three times in sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm dax
    ",Output: red red red green,red red red green,True,95
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the examples consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
Analyzing the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input sentence, ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" in the output sequence. Therefore, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: dax -> green. 
Meaning: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output is ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" has a consistent translation to ""red"". In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always includes the color ""red"" in the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
bluf -> the color associated with the preceding word. Rule:

- If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then bluf translates to ""red red.""
- If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then bluf translates to ""green green.""
- If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then bluf translates to ""yellow yellow.""

Thus, bluf repeats the color linked to the word that comes before it twice.
By examining each string of inputs alongside their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the rule for ""walm"". The rule seems to directly correlate with the translation of each input term into a specific color in the output. Here is the breakdown:

1. Every instance of ""lug"" is followed by blue in the output.
2. Every instance of ""zup"" is followed by yellow in the output.
3. Every instance of ""wif"" is followed by red in the output.
4. Every instance of ""dax"" is followed by green in the output.

Now focusing on instances of ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"" and before ""zup"", and the output is ""blue blue blue yellow"". Given that ""lug"" translates to blue and ""zup"" to yellow, we can infer that ""walm"" also translates to blue here.
   
2. In the second example, ""walm"" occurs twice, and each time it translates to blue in the output confirming the deduction from the first instance.

3. The third and fourth examples further confirm the rule since both times ""walm"" is in the input, it consistently corresponds to blue in the output.

In all cases, the term ""walm"" correlates to blue in the output, no matter its position in the string.

Therefore, the rule is:
walm -> meaning: blue

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue."" When we see ""lug"" in the input, ""blue"" is always in the corresponding output. Additionally, ""lug"" does not seem to modify the meaning of the words that come before or after it; it merely adds ""blue"" to the sequence. Other words like ""wif"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. 

Moreover, the order of the words in the input corresponds to the order of the colors in the output. For instance, ""dax lug wif"" leads to ""green blue red,"" maintaining the sequence. If a word is repeated, such as in ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" its related color is also repeated in the output.

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There is no evidence of it depending on context or position; it appears consistent across multiple examples. Therefore, the meaning attributed to ""dax"" is the color green.
Based on the provided examples, it is noticeable that each occurrence of the word ""wif"" results in the color ""red"" in the output. The presence of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the colors assigned to other words, as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" consistently produce ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively, regardless of their position relative to ""wif."" Based on this, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be straightforward.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Rule: bluf -> the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. If there is no preceding color word, it means ""red"".
walm -> repetition of the last color

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the last mentioned color. Each instance of ""walm"" in the input repeats the last color output before ""walm"" was mentioned, for as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we have the following:

1. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
2. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
3. Input: lug dax wif -> Output: blue green red
4. Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green
5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif -> Output: blue green yellow green green green red

It seems that each word has a corresponding color output. To isolate the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns linked exclusively to its presence:

- When ""wif"" appears as the first word, the first color is red (Examples 1 and 4).
- When ""wif"" appears in other positions (not the first), the color for ""wif"" is red (Examples 2, 3, and 5).
- When ""wif"" repeats, as in example 2, the repeated ""wif"" continues to give a red output.

Given that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond directly with the color ""yellow."" No matter the context, whenever ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: Every instance of  ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine the color outputs that correspond to the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" in each example.

1) When ""dax wif walm"" is the input, the output is ""green red red red."" The colors corresponding to ""dax"" and ""wif"" are green and red, respectively. ""Walm"" in this context repeats the color red three times.

2) With ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" the nonce word ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, and the output is ""red red red"" immediately after the previous ""wif.""

3) For ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the output after ""wif"" is again ""red red red,"" which implies that ""walm"" results in a repetition of red three times.

4) In ""dax lug walm,"" the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color that corresponds to ""lug.""

5) Finally, ""dax walm zup lug"" has ""walm"" immediately after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" repeating the color for ""dax.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding color-coded word to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three more times.

    Rules:

Rule: lug corresponds to the color blue in the provided examples.

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""red"". Thus, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every instance.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" across all provided examples.
Observing the examples, a pattern can be recognized with the words and their corresponding color outputs. Going through each example:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Since we already see that ""zup"" becomes ""yellow"" and ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" it suggests ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""

2. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow red red green."" Here again, the words ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" are repeated from previous examples, translating to ""green,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively. With ""bluf"" placed before the last ""dax,"" the red before the last green seems to correspond to ""bluf.""

3. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue."" The ""bluf"" here again translates to ""green,"" making it align with the ""dax"" preceding it.

4. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" translates to ""blue blue green green."" It appears ""bluf"" follows the color of the word before it, being ""blue"" after ""lug,"" and ""green"" after ""dax.""

5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow,"" following the pattern of matching the color of the preceding word.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" matches the color of the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for common patterns in the examples given.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" appears first in sequence and produces ""green""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and also produces ""green""
- ""wif"" produces ""red""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and produces ""yellow""
- ""wif"" produces ""red""
- ""walm"" is the last in the sequence and produces ""red""

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" produces ""red""
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and produces ""red""
- ""dax"" is the last in sequence and produces ""green""

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces ""yellow""
- ""dax"" after ""walm"" produces ""green""
- ""lug"" after ""dax"" and at the end of the sequence produces ""blue""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and produces ""red""
- ""walm"" is the last in the sequence and produces ""red""

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output. Instead, its output seems to depend on its position and the words around it. 

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup,"" it takes on the color of the word that precedes it.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or is the last word in the sequence, it produces ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it outputs the color of the word that precedes it unless it follows ""wif"" or is the last word in the sequence, in which case it outputs ""red.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word, but outputs ""red"" if following ""wif"" or at the end of a sequence.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the output regardless of its position in the input. Each input example begins with ""wif"" and the output always starts with ""red."" Even when ""wif"" is not at the beginning of the input, for example in ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"", ""red"" appears in the output at the position corresponding to where ""wif"" appeared in the input. 

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeated color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: Bluf takes the color mentioned before it and repeats it once. If there is no color word before bluf, it defaults to blue. Hence when you see ""lug bluf"", lug is translated to blue and bluf repeats the blue, giving you ""blue blue"". When bluf follows ""wif"", which is red, it repeats the red, resulting in ""red red"".
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the output color is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" If ""walm"" precedes the mentioned color, it adopts that color for its sequence.

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow."" It is consistent across all examples regardless of the order or the presence of other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> the same color as the word that precedes it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the color associated with the preceding word. If ""zup"" means yellow, then ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"". If ""lug"" means blue, then ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"", and so on.
To discern the meaning of ""walm,"" let's organize the given input-output pairs and identify the rules:

1. `lug walm` -> `blue blue blue`
2. `lug dax walm` -> `blue green green green`
3. `dax walm` -> `green green green`
4. `zup wif dax walm lug` -> `yellow red green green green blue`
5. `dax walm` -> `green green green`

Here are the observations:

- The appearance of ""walm"" in each input corresponds to a pattern of repeated color words in the output.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", we see a repetition of ""blue."" Therefore, ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", we see a repetition of ""green."" Therefore, ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green.""
- The output always has one more repetition of the color word than the number of times ""walm"" appears, indicating that ""walm"" likely means ""repeat the previous color word.""
- We have additional words ""zup"" and ""wif"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, reinforcing the idea that nonce words correspond to color words.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color word one more time than the number of occurrences of ""walm.""

Example Application of Rule:
- `lug walm` has one ""lug"" before ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated (once for ""lug"" + once for ""walm"") = `blue blue blue`.
- `dax walm` has one ""dax"" before ""walm,"" so ""green"" is repeated (once for ""dax"" + once for ""walm"") = `green green green`.

From the given examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The colors seem to be consistent for given words in different inputs, except for the nonce word ""zup."" Let's analyze the word ""zup"" in each example and see how it is reflected in the output:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Since ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" to red in other examples, and ""walm"" also appears to correlate with the color red (based on other examples), it seems that ""zup"" is represented by the first ""yellow"" in the output.
  
- In the second example, ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red."" We know ""wif"" is red and ""bluf"" is yellow; therefore, ""zup"" is likely the first yellow again.
  
- In the third example, ""dax wif zup"" leads to ""green red yellow."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red from previous examples, ""zup"" must represent the yellow.
  
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup"" maps to ""red yellow,"" where ""wif"" is known to be red, suggesting ""zup"" is yellow.
  
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" From this, it appears that ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" is green, with a rule likely indicating that it repeats the color for the number of times it appears in sequence. This would leave ""zup"" as the sequence of ""yellow yellow yellow.""

All evidence points toward ""zup"" representing the color yellow in the output, with the exact number of occurrences depending on the specific color repetition rule in place for other words. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, the output color is the same as the color that corresponds to the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the context in which it appears:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

From the given examples, we can observe the following:

- The outputs are sequences of colors, and each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output.

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green and appears consistently as green in the outputs.

- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow and appears consistently as yellow in the outputs.

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and appears consistently as blue in the outputs.

- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and appears consistently as red in the outputs.

- The word ""bluf"" does not have a color associated with it in the examples provided, but it appears before blue consistently when ""lug"" is present, suggesting that ""bluf"" does not alter the color sequence.

Now let's examine the positions of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), and it results in a sequence of three yellows followed by a red.

- In the second example, ""walm"" is after ""dax"" (green) and followed by ""lug"" (blue), resulting in three greens followed by a blue.

- In the third example, ""walm"" is before ""dax"" (green), and after the sequence ""bluf lug"" (blue blue), resulting in blue blue blue followed by green.

- In the fourth example, without the last ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" results in the same sequence as the third example without its last color: blue blue blue.

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is after ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), and it results in three reds.

Taking all of this into consideration, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color immediately preceding it in the sequence, for a total of three occurrences of that color.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm dax wif lug
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow green red blue,green yellow yellow yellow green red blue,True,102
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue' in the provided examples.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""
2. The presence of ""dax"" without any context (Example 4: Input: dax Output: green) indicates that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
3. When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the output sequence includes both colors corresponding to ""wif"" and ""dax"" (red green).
4. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence (whether it's in the middle or at the end), it always corresponds to the output ""green.""
5. Other input words like ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" correspond to their outputs blue, yellow, and yellow, respectively, without altering the output related to ""dax.""

Thus, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output. This relationship holds true regardless of the other words present or their associated colors. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output corresponding to the occurrence of ""wif.""
From the examples given, it seems that the word ""zup"" always translates to the word ""yellow."" Furthermore, it seems that each other word provided in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Let's examine the repeated words and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
2. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
3. ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green."" It's important to note that ""dax"" and ""walm"" appear to share the same color output.
4. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Given this pattern, the rule for ""zup"" based on the available data is that ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Considering the provided examples, we can see that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Let's identify the color associated with each word, including ""bluf"":

1. wif -> red
2. dax -> green
3. lug -> blue
4. zup -> yellow
5. walm -> not explicitly shown, but we can deduce it later.

Now, we need to deduce the color represented by ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which results in ""red green"". We already know that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" must correspond to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is the last word and the output ends with ""yellow"". However, the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which we know translates to ""yellow"". Therefore, we cannot confirm that ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green"". Since ""dax"" is ""green"", this suggests ""bluf"" might also be ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is at the end, preceded by two instances of ""lug"", which is ""blue"". The output ends with ""blue blue"", which might imply ""bluf"" is also ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output is ""yellow blue"". Again, since we know ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""bluf"" could be ""yellow"" in this context.

Given the potentially conflicting evidence, it is necessary to find a pattern that reflects the context of the word ""bluf"" in order to determine its color consistently across all examples. By analyzing all examples, we notice that ""bluf"" always results in the color of the word that follows it (if it's not the last word) or the one that precedes it:

- In the first and third examples, ""dax"" (green) is after ""bluf"", and the output is ""green"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is the last word, and the word before it is ""zup"" (yellow), and the output is ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is the last word, preceded by ""lug"" (blue), and the output is ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" (blue) is after ""bluf"", and the output is ""blue"".

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately following it. If there is no word after ""bluf"", it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning is that ""bluf"" represents a chameleon-like behavior, taking on the property (in this case, color) of the adjacent word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the adjacent word
Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

It appears that the word ""walm"" causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated three times. We can deduce this as follows:

- Every occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by three repetitions of a color in the output.
- The color that is repeated corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"".
   - In examples 1 and 3, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" three times.
   - In example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" three times.
- In example 4, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""zup"" and ""wif""; the sequence of colors ""blue blue blue"" corresponds to ""lug walm"", and the colors for ""zup"" and ""wif"" follow it in the output.

Walm -> meaning: Walm causes the output color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm"", repeat the color corresponding to that word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. It does not seem to depend on the context or the position of ""lug"" in the input. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" has a consistent output no matter the context which is ""green"". It does not depend on adjacent words or position in the sequence. Hence, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The association does not appear to be affected by the context as ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" regardless of the other words in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word

Explanation: In each example, the color associated with the word ""bluf"" matches the color of the word immediately preceding it.

- In the first input, ""wif"" translates to red, and the output for ""bluf"" is also red.
- In the second input, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" is also green following it.
- In the third input, ""zup"" is yellow, and again ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In the fourth input, the output for ""bluf"" is red, which is the color of the preceding word ""wif"".
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which is colored blue, and thus ""bluf"" is also blue.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided and analyzing the pattern of colors, walm seems to be translated as a color that matches the color word that immediately precedes it. The rule can be derived by observing that every time walm occurs, it takes on the color value of the preceding color word.

Here is the justification:

1. (lug walm dax) -> (blue blue green): walm follows lug, which is blue, so walm is also blue.
2. (wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug) -> (red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue): walm follows lug, which is blue, thus walm is also blue.
3. (lug dax zup dax walm wif) -> (blue green yellow green green green red): walm follows dax, which is green, hence walm is also green.
4. (lug wif dax walm zup) -> (blue red green green green yellow): walm follows dax, which is green, so walm is green again.
5. (wif zup lug dax zup walm) -> (red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow): walm follows zup, which is yellow, therefore walm is yellow.

Rule: walm -> the color that is the same as the color word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Input: dax wif bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

The given examples consistently map the nonce word ""dax"" to the color ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. Every time ""dax"" occurs, the output is ""green.""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
4. ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the output ""green"" as in second and ""red"" as in first input.
5. ""walm"" results in ""green"" when combined with ""dax"" but ""blue"" otherwise.

The difficult part is determining the meaning of ""zup."" Let's try to see a pattern:

- In the first input, ""zup"" occurs after ""lug"" and before ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the second input, ""zup"" is between ""wif"" and ""wif,"" with ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the third input, ""zup"" is the first word, and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth input, ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow."" 
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output is ""green yellow.""

From these observations, irrespective of its position or the words around it, ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow."" 

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"". This is consistent in all examples provided. Each time the word ""bluf"" is used in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"". 

bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the relationship between the input terms and output colors and check for consistent patterns.

- When ""zup walm"" is in the input, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" occurs after ""dax"", as in the input ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" appears at the end of a sequence beginning with ""lug,"" as in the input ""lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" the output after ""lug"" is ""blue blue blue"" followed by the colors corresponding to other input terms.
- If ""walm"" follows ""lug wif bluf"" (which corresponds to ""blue red red""), the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- Again, when ""walm"" follows ""wif zup bluf lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times, ignoring any words that come after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,105
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". There doesn't seem to be any context involving the placement of ""dax"" within a list of words that changes this outcome. Other words like ""wif"", ""lug"", and ""bluf"" correspond to other colors, like ""red"", ""blue"", and ""green"" respectively, as consistent with their appearances followed by a color in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, we can establish a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

- Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red"".
- The position of ""wif"" in the input doesn't change the output color associated with it.
  
Additionally, the other words in the examples seem to correspond with their own consistent output color:

- ""bluf"" corresponds with ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" and with ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"". There's not enough data about ""bluf"" in other contexts to determine a pattern for it alone.
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"".
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"".
- ""walm"" corresponds with ""blue"".

Given these observations, we can determine that ""wif"" correlates to ""red"" regardless of its context, while the meanings of the other words might change based on what precedes them.

Rule: wif -> red
In each example, ""zup"" consistently produces the output ""yellow"". However, it also appears to transform the other non-zup words into colors as follows:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green when following dax, but following zup it gives yellow
- lug -> blue only when following zup

The transformation could be context-dependent for some words (like ""bluf""), but in each case, ""zup"" alone yields ""yellow."" The color output sequence corresponds to the position of the input words relative to ""zup"".

So the rule appears to be that ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and it triggers translation of adjacent words into specific colors based on their position and what they are combined with.

Rule: 
zup -> ""yellow"" (zup translates to the color yellow, and influences the translation of nearby words into colors based on their order and combination.)
Based on the examples provided, we have the following correlations:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""

Since ""bluf"" consistently results in two color outputs and always the same color (red in this case), we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> red red

Meaning that ""bluf"" is translated into the color ""red"" repeated twice.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by looking for patterns corresponding to its occurrences. Here is the analysis:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""blue"" appears in the output.
2. The sequence of ""blue"" seems to be of a length corresponding to the position of ""walm"". For example:
   - In the first example, ""walm"" is the second word and there are two ""green"" before it, so it's followed by two ""blue"".
   - In the third example, ""walm"" is the fourth word and followed by four ""blue"" in sequence.

Given this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Indicates a sequence of ""blue"" in the output equal in number to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence counting from the first ""walm"". If there are multiple instances of ""walm"", the count resets with each occurrence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes ""blue"" in the corresponding position.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

In each example provided, whenever the word ""dax"" is used, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Thus, ""dax"" means ""green.""
From the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Each instance of ""wif"" consistently corresponds to an ""red"" in the output.
- Other words in the input correspond to other colors in the output, but ""wif"" is always paired with ""red"" regardless of its position in the input.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" can be inferred as:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". This is evident as every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds with ""yellow"" in the output sequence. Therefore:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When ""zup"" is present in the input, it should be translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the inputs and the corresponding outputs, it seems like each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Repeated input words yield repeated colors in the output, such as ""dax"" always corresponding to green and ""lug"" always corresponding to blue. The response pattern when ""bluf"" is present always corresponds to the color red in the output. 

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> red.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Rule: If a color is mentioned directly before ""walm,"" then the output is a repetition of the associated color with ""walm"" as many times as the number of syllables in the preceding color word. For instance, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and has one syllable, so ""walm"" repeats the word ""blue"" three times. Similarly, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, reflecting the single syllable in ""dax.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". This conclusion is drawn because in every example given, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we want to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"". Let's look for patterns:

In the first example:
- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow""
Here, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and has a corresponding output ""red"", and it appears again before ""zup"" and again translates to ""red"".

In the second example:
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" which translates to ""blue yellow"". The sequence ""walm"" has an output of two ""yellow"" and ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red"".

In the third example:
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green""
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both at the beginning and at the end of the series, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" irrespective of its position.

In the fourth example:
- ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue""
This sequence also places ""wif"" translating to ""red"" despite the different context of surrounding words.

In the fifth example:
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green""
Here again, the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" at the beginning of the sequence.

Based on the examples given, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words and irrespective of the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze each input-output pair where ""bluf"" is present:

- Input: dax zup lug zup bluf -> Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
- Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red

In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" and the corresponding color is yellow, which is the same as ""zup.""
In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" and the corresponding color is blue, which is the same as ""lug.""
In the third example, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" and the corresponding color is green, which is the same color as ""dax.""
In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is just after ""zup,"" and the output is again yellow, as with ""zup.""
In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" and the corresponding color is red, which is the same as ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word immediately preceding it. ""Bluf"" takes the color that corresponds to the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

- In the first example, the color before ""walm"" is green, and the output is ""green green green.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue), each time the corresponding color is repeated three times.
- The third and fifth examples both have ""zup"" before ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" each time.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm,"" giving ""blue blue blue,"" and similarly, after ""wif"" and the second ""lug,"" the colors red and blue are output, though ""walm"" is not repeated after ""wif,"" therefore the rule specifically applies to ""lug walm,"" indicating that ""wif"" may not trigger the rule or it has a different association.

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears after another word, the color corresponding to that previous word is repeated. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red."" Similarly, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which gives ""lug bluf"" as ""blue blue.""

- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
  ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow,"" and we can deduce that ""walm"" refers to repeated ""yellow"" as it appears more than once.

Rule:
zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to duplicate the color output of the word before it.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns of input and output.

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" producing ""red red.""
- Continuing to the third example, the pattern holds with ""walm"" producing two additional repetitions of ""green.""
- The fourth example again confirms this pattern, with ""walm"" causing a triple repetition of the last color, which is ""green"" in this case.
- The fifth example consolidates the pattern, with ""walm"" inducing a triple repetition of the last mentioned color, which is ""red"" here, followed by its appearance later inducing a triple repetition of ""blue.""

Rule: 
walm -> induces a repetition of the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time it is mentioned, the output is the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to translate to the word ""red."" However, its presence also seems to trigger repetition in the preceding color words. 

Examining the examples closely:
- In the first example, ""dax wif"" results in ""green red,"" indicating that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""wif"" means ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" The word ""walm"" is repeated twice after ""wif,"" which corresponds to a triple repetition in the output. This suggests that ""wif"" causes the word that follows it to repeat in the following pattern: one occurrence of the word before ""wif,"" followed by ""red,"" leads to two repetitions of the color that follows ""wif.""
- Looking at the third example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" we find that ""lug"" and ""walm"" are repeated after each ""wif"" according to the same pattern we've observed: we say the color, then ""red,"" then the color as many times as the position of the ""wif"" in the sequence (second ""wif"" leads to two repetitions).
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the presence of ""wif"" still results in ""red,"" with preceding colors mentioned once before it.

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and causes the color word immediately following it to repeat a number of times based on the position of ""wif"" in the word sequence (e.g., ""wif"" being the nth word would mean the following color repeats n-1 times.)

wif -> ""red"" (triggers repetition of the following color word)
From the given examples, we can induce that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow. (Meaning that ""zup"" represents the color yellow)
bluf -> green

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. ""Bluf,"" regardless of its position in the sequence, consistently translates to ""green.""
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm,"" then ""walm"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning

Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug means blue.
Rule: dax -> green

From the given examples, we can deduce that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is included in the output. Additionally, each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. This consistency across different examples supports the conclusion that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Whenever ""wif"" is encountered in the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words. 

Therefore, the rule can be concluded as:
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to ""red"" in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.
Walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: The term ""walm"" indicates that the color word which comes before it should be repeated a number of times. Looking at the examples:

- In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times before moving on to the next colors.
- In ""dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and it is repeated three times due to ""walm,"" before addressing ""zup.""
- In ""wif lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm,"" the pattern continues with ""blue"" being repeated three times after ""walm.""
- In ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated before moving on to ""lug.""

Each instance shows that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is a color word, and that color word is then repeated multiple times after ""walm,"" consistent with the number of times the color appears in the output sequence. The frequency of repetition may also depend on some unwritten rule since it repeats a color word a variable number of times (three or four), possibly depending on the position of ""walm"" within the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems quite straightforward:

lug -> blue

The word ""lug,"" whenever it appears in the input, corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word 'dax' correlates to the output 'green'. Whenever 'dax' appears in the input, 'green' appears in the output. It does not seem to matter where 'dax' appears in the sequence; it consistently maps to the output 'green'. 

Further investigation of the other words and their consistent mapping to colors suggests that each word translates to a specific color: 'wif' translates to 'red', 'bluf' translates to 'blue', and 'lug' translates to 'blue'. 'Walm' is a bit harder to deduce with only one instance given, but as 'walm' results in triple 'green' in the output, and each word seems to correlate to one color, it is possible that 'walm' could mean 'green green green', although without further evidence this is speculative.

Given this information, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that every time the nonce word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is outputted. It does not seem to alter depending on the position of ""wif"" in the input string, nor does it depend on the words that come before or after it. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> ""repeat the color of the previous word"". Rule: The word ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the next use of the same color associated with the previously mentioned word, creating a sequence of the same color until a new color word is mentioned.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Consider the given examples:

1. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red

2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

3. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red

4. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

5. Input: lug dax lug
   Output: blue green blue

Analyzing the patterns:

- Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is correlated with ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context surrounding it.
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".
- The word ""walm"" is not present in the input and outputs containing ""lug"", ""dax"", or ""wif"". However, by looking at the sequence in the second example, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely generates the output ""blue"" multiplied by the number of letters in the word ""walm"", which is 4, hence ""blue blue blue blue"".

Based on the above deductions, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the nonce word dax is used, the output is always green, regardless of the context or other words present.
Based on the given examples and their corresponding outputs, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Here are the examples with clarification:

1. ""lug dax wif"" translates to ""blue green red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
3. ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow."" ""Wif"" is the first word and translates to ""red,"" the first color in the output.
4. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green."" The word ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red"" both times.
5. ""lug zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""blue yellow green red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" comes before the last ""zup"" and translates to ""red.""

wif -> red. Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every instance it appears in the input.
Based on the examples provided, the word 'zup' appears consistently with the output 'yellow.' There is no variation in the output when 'zup' is present in the input, regardless of the context or position of 'zup' in the input sentence. Given this consistent pairing, we can induce that 'zup' directly translates to the color 'yellow.'

Therefore, the rule can be stated as: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided inputs and outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that immediately precedes it. To put it another way, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first input, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows, which gives the output ""yellow.""
- In the second input, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows, giving the output ""blue.""
- In the third input, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows, giving the output ""yellow.""
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows, which gives the output ""green.""
- In the fifth input, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows, giving the output ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that precedes it.
Walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, so ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". Similarly ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" to blue, so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" and ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup lug
    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow blue,True,114
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" seems to correspond to a triplet of the color that comes after ""lug,"" which is ""blue."" Thus, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  
- In the second example, ""zup lug zup"" ends with ""yellow blue,"" matching the sequence from ""zup"" to ""lug,"" which again indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" confirming that ""lug"" is ""blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug zup dax lug"" translates to ""blue yellow green blue"" wherein the presence of ""lug"" at the beginning and the end corresponds to ""blue"" both times.

- In the fifth example, while the sequence is more complex, each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following patterns:

1. Every time the word ""dax"" appears in an input, the output is ""green.""
2. No other input word consistently corresponds to ""green"" across all examples.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" signals the output ""green.""

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, I will infer the meaning or rule for the word ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""wif zup lug zup lug"" is translated to ""red yellow blue yellow blue."" Here we see that ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow,"" which also appears between other colors.
- In the second example, ""lug dax zup lug wif"" becomes ""blue green yellow blue red."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The third example, ""zup bluf,"" is turned into ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup"" is ""blue yellow,"" which further signifies that ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm zup"" translates as ""green green green yellow,"" once more appointing ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position or context within the list of words. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to an output pattern of repeated colors. The color that is repeated is the color that corresponds to the word or segment preceding ""bluf"". The rule for ""bluf"" appears to be repeating the color that would be outputted by the word immediately before it.

Here is the pattern observed:

- In ""dax zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, so ""bluf"" produces a second yellow.
- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" still corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" again produces another yellow.
- In ""dax zup lug bluf"", ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to the color blue, so ""bluf"" results in a second blue.
- In ""dax lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" yields another blue.
- In ""wif dax bluf"", ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to green, therefore ""bluf"" entails a repetition of the color green.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word right before ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine how the output changes in examples where ""walm"" is included compared to where it is absent. Here is the analysis:

1. In every instance of ""walm"" being used, the output is a repetition of the color that precedes it.
2. The number of repetitions of the color seems to depend on the position of ""walm"" among other words:
   - If ""walm"" is after a single color (e.g., ""dax walm""), the preceding color is repeated three times.
   - If ""walm"" is after two different colors (e.g., ""wif bluf dax walm""), the last color before ""walm"" is repeated three more times in the output, making it a total of four times because ""dax"" itself translates to ""green.""
   - If ""walm"" directly follows a sequence of the same color (e.g., ""lug walm""), it repeats the sequence three more times.

Based on these observations, it's evident that the rule for ""walm"" in this context is that it triggers the repetition of the color word immediately preceding it in the output, repeating it a number of times based on its position relative to other color words—usually three additional times but repeated alongside the existing occurrences of that color.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color in the output multiple times (typically three more times).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words, ""lug"" results in ""blue"". Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples.
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates into the color ""green."" Each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the list of words.

Hence, the rule is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> green
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the color associated with the previous word, up to three additional times, making a total of four instances including the first mention. If ""walm"" occurs twice in a row, the repetition pattern is also doubled for the associated color.

Here are the breakdowns of the examples given:

- In the first example: ""dax zup walm wif walm"", ""dax"" equates to the color green, ""zup"" to yellow. ""Walm"" after ""zup"" makes ""yellow"" appear four times total, then ""wif"" turns into red once, and again ""walm"" after ""wif"" makes ""red"" appear three more times, totaling four reds.

- In the second example: ""lug dax walm wif"", ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, and following ""walm"" after ""dax"" there are four greens in total. ""Wif"" translates into red.

- In the third example: ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue and the ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates three more blues.

- In the fourth example: ""zup dax lug walm zup"", the sequence follows the same logic: ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue and is followed by ""walm"", which generates three additional blues, followed by another ""zup"" yielding another yellow.

- In the fifth example: ""dax walm zup lug"", ""dax"" is green and is directly followed by ""walm"", causing three additional greens, then ""zup"" is yellow and ""lug"" ends the sequence with blue.

Based on the examples, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> Induces the repetition of the color associated with the previous word up to four times in total (including the initial occurrence). If ""walm"" follows ""walm"", the repetition occurs for the color associated with the word preceding the first ""walm"".

2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" supports the above hypothesis, with 'lug' being associated with blue.

3. ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red"" further supports the rule that 'walm' repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

4. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"" shows that 'walm' follows the new color word 'zup,' which is associated with yellow, and repeats it three times, and then follows 'wif' with red, repeating it three times.

5. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green"" confirms that 'walm' creates a repetition of three for the color associated with the preceding word, regardless of other words that appear between the color word and 'walm.'

Given these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: 'walm' repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output.

Therefore, walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug walm wif zup dax
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue red yellow green,yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue red yellow green,True,121
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" is that it translates to the color blue, regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a color. ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in all examples. ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the other words around it. The colour yellow is not associated with any other input word besides ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns in both the input and output sequences.

Looking at the first example:

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

We can see that ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" in this context corresponds to ""green,"" which is the color that ""dax"" mapped to directly before it.

In the second example:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here, we again see ""zup"" mapping to ""yellow,"" and the ""bluf"" following it also maps to ""yellow."" The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word right before it.

In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, a similar pattern holds. ""Bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it:

- In the third example, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also maps to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also maps to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also maps to ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" adopts the color value of the preceding word in the sequence. 

Therefore:

bluf -> the color of the word before it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat three times. So, if ""lug"" equals blue, then ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow"". If ""dax"" equals green, ""walm"" after ""dax"" causes ""green green green"". Thus, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color of the preceding word thrice.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word before it to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,122
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in every example provided. Therefore, lug means blue.
To find the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine each instance where it appears and see what follows. 

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""green blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" precedes both ""walm"" and ""lug,"" which in the output is ""green blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which results in ""green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is directly followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""green yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is in between ""walm"" and ""zup"" and also precedes ""wif,"" yielding ""green yellow green red.""

The consistent output following ""dax"" is ""green,"" suggesting that it corresponds to this color.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each output. There doesn't appear to be a more complex rule underlying its use based on these examples, and ""wif"" does not seem dependent on the context since it always results in the same output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red red

Rule: When ""bluf"" is encountered, the output is always ""red red,"" regardless of the preceding words.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,123
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule that associates the word ""dax"" with a specific color. Each instance shows that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. This is evident as each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output in the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" No matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence, the output is always ""yellow."" There's no variation in output related to the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence, which suggests that its meaning is not dependent on context within the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that bluf corresponds to the color blue. In all instances where the word 'bluf' is used in the input, the output consistently includes the color blue in the respective position. Therefore, the rule derived from the examples is:

bluf -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns and how they match the input and the output.

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to three repetitions of ""blue.""

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""green.""

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow"" (following the ""zup"").

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" here corresponds to three repetitions of ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""blue.""

From the above analysis, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word immediately preceding it, repeated three times. To be more precise, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that appears directly before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow blue,True,124
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
To identify what ""dax"" means, let's analyze the correlation between the input and output sequences. First we should note the presence and color output of ""dax"" in each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm  
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue  
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif  
   Output: red green red red yellow red  
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

3. Input: lug dax zup wif  
   Output: blue green yellow red  
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

4. Input: dax bluf lug wif  
   Output: green green blue red  
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

5. Input: dax zup bluf  
   Output: green yellow yellow  
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Across all examples, irrespective of the words that come before or after ""dax,"" its corresponding color is always ""green."" It seems from these examples that ""dax"" does not depend on context and has a consistent output.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Reviewing the examples and comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can infer the following individual translations:

- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""walm"" -> ""blue""

`bluf` consistently corresponds with the color `red` in all of those instances where it isn't immediately next to another color word which also corresponds to `red`. Noticing that in the first example it is flanked by ""dax"" (green) and still outputs ""red"" twice, but in the third example where `bluf` is subsequent to ""wif"" (red) it outputs a red only once, suggests that `bluf` translates to `red` unless it directly follows another `red`, in which case its output is omitted.

However, if we analyze the final example where `bluf` is directly followed by ""wif"" (red), we see that both words produce an output of ""red"". This may be seen as contradicting the previous observation unless we notice that every instance of `bluf` either begins a sequence or is preceded by a color word different than ""wif"". This observation enlightens the previous rule, indicating that `bluf` does not produce a ""red"" when it is followed by another `bluf` token.

Rule: bluf -> red, but when bluf is immediately followed by another bluf, the second one does not produce an output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each instance and the corresponding outputs:

1. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
2. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
3. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
4. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, we can try to find a pattern for 'walm'. 

In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue"", and from the second example, ""walm lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red."" Here, the word before ""walm"" has its color repeated after ""walm"".

In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, this pattern appears to hold as well. The word immediately preceding ""walm"" has its color output repeated once more before moving on to the next color pattern determined by the subsequent word.

So, based on these observations, “walm” seems to repeat the color output of the word immediately before it:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green."" Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There also seems to be an association between the other words (zup, walm, wif, lug) and other colors, but since the task only asks to deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we'll focus on that.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" means ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.
Given the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" The other words appear to correspond to different colors, with ""wif"" also always corresponding to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule we can induce from the examples is:

Rule: bluf -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, it looks like ""walm"" translates to a repeat of the color that corresponds to the word preceding it. For example:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which implies that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" indicates that the color should be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" again leads to the color being repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" hence ""lug"" must stand for blue, with ""walm"" ensuring it is said three times.

However, the last example includes ""lug zup wif,"" which leads to ""blue yellow red,"" followed by ""dax"" leading to ""green,"" but it doesn't directly affect the meaning of ""walm,"" as ""walm"" is not present after these words.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> color repetition. Rule: The word ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" we should look at the pattern of colors that appear in each output following the word ""walm."" Here are the observations:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, a repetition of three colors followed by a distinct color appears in the output.
2. The repeated color seems to be associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
3. The distinct color following the repetition seems to be associated with the word immediately following ""walm.""

Analyzing the inputs and outputs: 

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", so ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the first color in the output is ""yellow,"" so ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and the last color is ""red,"" suggesting ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- The third input includes ""lug"" before ""walm"" and ""wif"" after ""walm,"" which matches the output pattern ""blue blue blue red,"" consistent with the first two observations.
- The fourth and fifth examples are also consistent with the first two observations when considering the positions of ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" in their respective sequences and the associated colors.

Based on this, we can induce a general rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the output will be a sequence of three colors corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm,"" followed by a single color corresponding to the word immediately after ""walm.""

Therefore:

walm -> Rule: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times, then follow it by the color associated with the next word.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
From the provided examples, the term ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" Therefore, we can conclude that ""lug"" maps to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Given the examples, the word ""dax"" correlates consistently with the output ""green."" Regardless of position within the input sequence, or the other words present, ""dax"" always results in ""green"" appearing in the output sequence. This suggests that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green."" Other words appear to correspond with their own colors as well: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""walm"" is possibly linked to a repetition rule, since when ""walm"" appears once in the input, ""green"" is repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that different words correspond to different colors and that the word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"" no matter where it appears in the sequence:

- Input: ""wif"" → Output: ""red""
- Input: ""dax wif"" → Output: ""green red""
- Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" → Output: ""red red green green green""
- Input: ""wif zup dax bluf"" → Output: ""red yellow green green""

From these examples, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears an equal number of times in the output. There is no situation in the provided examples where ""zup"" correlates with any other color or variable output. Hence, the rule deduced is that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" repeats the color word that precedes it in the output. Here's the breakdown according to the inputs and outputs:

- ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color ""blue"" which follows ""lug"".
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" which follows ""wif"".
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green"" which follows ""dax"" twice.
- The repetition of the example ""dax bluf"" with the same translation ""green green"" confirms the previously observed rule.
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""green green red blue"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green"" which follows ""dax"".

Considering these observations, the rule governing the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the output color word that immediately precedes it. Rule: Bluf duplicates the preceding color word in the output.
walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" in this context seems to represent repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, output the color corresponding to that word three times. If ""walm"" is the first word, there might be a default color it refers to, but that case is not provided in the examples. 

- In ""zup walm dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and with ""walm"" following, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" followed by ""green"" for ""dax.""
- In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so with ""walm,"" it becomes ""blue blue blue,"" followed by ""red red"" for ""wif bluf.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" makes it ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and the final ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples is that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" The other words in the inputs translate to different colors as well. For instance, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" There is no example provided that modifies the meaning of ""wif"" based on context. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is that it consistently means ""red,"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" generates a specific output independent of its position in the input sequence. The rule does not seem to be influenced by the presence of other words, as ""zup"" consistently translates to the output ""yellow.""

Based on the given examples:
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to one ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" may be irrelevant or corresponds to another ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" outputs ""green green green red red red yellow,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to the last single ""yellow.""
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" being the first ""yellow.""
- In a single-word input ""zup,"" the output is simply ""yellow.""
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue red green,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" again.

The rule appears straightforward:
Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples and look for patterns.

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow
   Here ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
   In this example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here as well, it suggests that ""bluf"" is copying the color of the word before it.

3. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug | Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   In this series, after ""dax"" which is green, ""bluf"" again takes the color green. Also, after ""zup"" which is yellow twice, ""bluf"" is yellow both times, reinforcing the pattern.

4. Input: lug wif bluf | Output: blue red red
   Following ""wif"" which is red, ""bluf"" is also red. This aligns with the idea that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

5. Input: wif dax bluf | Output: red green green
   After ""dax"" which is green, ""bluf"" is green.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat or copy the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to lead to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Let's break down the examples to observe the pattern:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Here, 'dax' corresponds to 'green'. Following 'walm', the color 'green' is repeated three times.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- In this case, 'wif' maps to 'red', and post 'walm', we again have 'red' repeated three times.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- In this sequence, the word before 'walm' is 'zup', which corresponds to 'yellow'. After 'walm', 'yellow' is repeated three times following which there is 'blue' that corresponds to the next word 'lug'.

Given there are no counterexamples where ""walm"" produces a different output, the rule seems consistent across the examples.

Rule: walm means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it three times. 

walm -> repeat the previous color three times

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, irrespective of its position in the sequence. Therefore, whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""dax"" is used alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is paired with ""zup,"" regardless of what comes before, it leads to ""green yellow"" in the output with an additional color before these based on the first word in the input.
- When ""dax"" is paired with ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue,"" with ""green"" always preceding ""blue.""

Given the consistent appearance of ""green"" in the outputs whenever ""dax"" is used in the input, we can deduce the meaning associated with ""dax"":

dax -> green
wif -> red. Rule: Every instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given context.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first analyze the patterns of input and output across all examples:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
2. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
3. Input: dax bluf lug wif | Output: green green blue red
4. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif | Output: blue green green yellow blue red
5. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf | Output: yellow red green red red

Looking at the examples, let's see if there's a pattern associated with each word:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Now, let's look specifically at ""bluf"":

- In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red green.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"" and the output is ""green blue.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is succeeded by ""zup"" and the output is ""green yellow.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is the last word and the output sequence ends with ""red.""

From the outputs immediately after ""bluf,"" we can see that it does not correspond to a consistent color. This means that ""bluf"" likely acts as a modifier or affects the sequence in a particular way, rather than translating to a single color. Observing that ""bluf"" is always followed by the color that would be associated with the word immediately following ""bluf,"" we can induce that ""bluf"" may mean ""repeat the next color"".

Let's check this rule:

- In example 1, after ""bluf,"" ""green"" repeats once.
- In example 2, after ""bluf,"" ""green"" repeats.
- In example 3, after ""bluf,"" ""blue"" does not repeat because ""wif"" should be ""red"" but looking at the entire sequence, it's plausible that ""bluf"" causes a shift in the sequence such that the color after ""bluf"" is placed before it causing ""dax"" -> ""green"" to appear before ""bluf"" as well.
- In example 4, after ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" repeats.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" does not have a word after it, but the last color ""red"" is repeated, which corresponds to ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, it makes sense that ""bluf"" causes the output color of the word following it to be duplicated, but in the case of example 3, it seems to also ""shift"" the output backwards in the sequence. Thus, ""bluf"" represents a rule that duplicates the output of the following word, with certain conditions allowing a shift in the sequence:

Rule: bluf -> causes the color of the next word to repeat or shifts the sequence to duplicate the color of the word following it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that walm represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here are the instances that lead to this conclusion:

1. In ""dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" and the output ""green green green"" suggests that ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the word ""green"" that precedes it, before moving on to ""lug"" which correlates to ""blue.""
2. In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" and the output ""yellow yellow yellow"" supports that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" three times.
3. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and given the output ""green blue blue blue,"" it suggests that ""walm"" is repeating the color associated with ""lug.""
4. In ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" observing that ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" the sequence ""red red red"" is the output associated with ""walm.""
5. In ""lug walm zup wif,"" the ""blue blue blue"" sequence is noted after ""lug,"" and before the sequence changes color to ""yellow"" associated with ""zup,"" indicating again that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes prior to it (in this case, ""lug"").

From these observations, we can deduce the following:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue green green,blue blue green,False,130
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently results in the output of ""blue."" Each instance where lug is present, the output includes ""blue,"" and the position of ""lug"" in the input doesn't seem to affect the color associated with it. This suggests that the nonce word ""lug"" simply translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in a ""green"" in the output. Here are the observations in this format:

- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> green yellow green green green (every ""dax"" leads to ""green"")
- ""dax lug wif"" -> green blue red (""dax"" at the beginning results in ""green"")
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> green yellow yellow (""dax"" at the beginning results in ""green"")
- ""dax lug dax"" -> green blue green (both occurrences of ""dax"" result in ""green"")
- ""lug dax"" -> blue green (the occurrence of ""dax"" at the end still gives ""green"")

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every instance where the word ""wif"" is used in an input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the context provided by the examples. Each occurrence of ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow"" in the output.
To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first look at the provided examples and their outputs in a structured manner:

1. `wif bluf` -> `red red`
2. `wif bluf dax walm` -> `red red green green green`
3. `dax bluf wif zup wif` -> `green green red yellow red`
4. `lug wif bluf` -> `blue red red`
5. `wif dax bluf` -> `red green green`

Let's analyze the pattern for ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" as in examples 1, 2, and 4, the output contains two ""red"" words after the corresponding ""wif"" colors. This may suggest that ""bluf"" repeats the color-word associated with the word in front of it.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output directly following ""dax"" contains two ""green"" words. This reinforces the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color-word associated with the word in front of it.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"", which aligns with the word ""green,"" and results in two consecutive ""green"" outputs in the output string.

By observing these examples, we can deduce the operative rule that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated. So, in terms of summarizing the rule,

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color-word associated with the immediately preceding word.
Based on the given examples, ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that the first word represents. Each time the word ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color tied to the word prior to ""walm"". 

For example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Similarly, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates a repetition of three of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Analyzing the input and output pairs provided, it is apparent that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. However, the color that each word corresponds to is not consistent across all examples, which suggests that the meaning of ""dax"" does not correspond to a single color. Instead, it seems that ""dax"" might represent a rule or condition regarding how colors are assigned. Let's examine the occurrences of ""dax"":

1. Input: zup bluf dax - Output: yellow yellow green
   - ""dax"" is at the end and outputs green.
   
2. Input: dax wif lug - Output: green red blue
   - ""dax"" is at the beginning and outputs green.

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm - Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" is at the beginning, and the first color is green.

4. Input: dax zup wif - Output: green yellow red
   - ""dax"" is at the beginning and outputs green.

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf - Output: green green green red red
   - ""dax"" is at the beginning and outputs green.

In every example, the occurrence of ""dax"" correlates with the color green. However, its position in the input sequence does not seem to affect this output color. Thus, we can deduce that the rule for ""dax"" is that it corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore: dax -> green. Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is green.
Based on the examples provided where each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output sequence, it can be inferred that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow' in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Here is the observed pattern:

Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow

Thus, the word 'zup' always corresponds to the color 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf corresponds to the color ""red"" when following the word ""wif""; otherwise, bluf corresponds to the color ""green"".
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: Walm means to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems each word corresponds to a particular color.

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
- ""walm"" consistently corresponds to red red red, when it precedes ""lug"".

In each instance, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of the words that come after it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From examining the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. Each non-nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output:
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue""

2. It appears that each instance of ""bluf"" in the input results in a repetition of the last color mentioned two times in the output.

Based on these observations, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be understood as a rule to repeat the last mentioned color twice in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the last mentioned color twice.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it outputs two consecutive colors that are the same as the color following the last word that was mentioned before ""walm"".

Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue green blue blue blue"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", thus ""walm"" results in ""blue blue"".

2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", thus ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow"".

3. ""wif walm lug bluf"" outputs ""red red red blue blue"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", thus ""walm"" results in ""red red"".

4. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" outputs ""red red green green red red red blue red"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", so ""walm"" results in ""red red"".

5. ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red"". The last word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", thus ""walm"" results in ""red red"".

Rule: walm -> Outputs the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeated once.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is input, the output is always ""blue,"" regardless of the position or combination with other words.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Notice that in every input, the word ""dax"" is present, and in each output, the word ""green"" is also present. Thus, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.
Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: Every instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the immediately preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each example considering that every ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a specific color or pattern in the output.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, both ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could mean ""the same color as the preceding word.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again seems to correspond to the same color as the preceding word, in this case, ""blue.""

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

In this series, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" again takes the color of ""lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The second ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" represents the same color as the preceding word.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The ""walm"" here corresponds to ""green,"" the same color as ""dax,"" followed by ""lug,"" which also corresponds to ""green.""

This seems to confirm our pattern: ""walm"" represents the same color as the preceding word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> the same color as the preceding word.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input string or the presence of other nonce words. Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, every occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. The rule appears to be a straightforward substitution regardless of the context or the other words present.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of the word ""bluf"", we should examine the patterns before and after ""bluf"" in each example and compare them to their corresponding outputs:

1. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
4. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
5. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue

Looking at the input-output pairs:

- In example 1, ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue"" and ""bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue."" However, we need to attribute the correct color to ""lug"" and ""zup"" to isolate ""bluf.""
- In example 2, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"" suggesting that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color ""green."" 
- In example 3, the pattern ""zup lug bluf"" maps to ""yellow blue blue,"" from which we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" since ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" 
- In example 4, ""lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" following ""dax.""
- Lastly, in example 5, ""dax lug bluf"" maps to ""green blue blue,"" which again suggests ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

From these comparisons, we can deduce a clear pattern where ""bluf"" represents the color of whatever word came immediately before it. This can be seen in examples 3, 4, and 5.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
From the given examples, it seems that walm is a command that instructs us to repeat the color associated with the previous word. Let us examine how this applies to the examples:

Example 1:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green
Here, 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' and walm leads to two additional 'green's, implying that walm means ""repeat the previous color twice.""

Example 2:
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
- Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Here, the last word is 'wif,' which corresponds to 'red,' before walm is used. The output is 'red red red,' aligning with ""repeat the previous color twice.""

Example 3:
- Input: dax lug walm
- Output: green blue blue blue
In this example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' and is followed by walm, resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" once more suggesting that walm means ""repeat the previous color twice.""

Example 4:
Same as above, reinforcing the same rule.

Example 5:
- Input: lug dax walm
- Output: blue green green green
Here, 'dax' is the word before walm and corresponds to 'green.' The output is ""green green green,"" meaning that walm requires us to repeat the previous color twice.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence or other words present.
dax -> green. Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in every example. The presence of ""wif"" in a sequence always results in the word ""red"" in the corresponding output.
Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it is used. Every instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" being part of the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow.
bluf -> blue. Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of context within the given examples.
Rule: The word ""walm"" after a color-indicating word causes the output to repeat that color's corresponding term three times. 

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Rule: Each occurrence of ""lug"" translates to the word ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green
Given the examples, we can induce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". This is evidenced by every instance of ""wif"" being translated into ""red"", irrespective of its position in the input string or the presence of other words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input containing ""bluf"" and their corresponding output:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is present, the output is ""red"" immediately following its position.

Based on the examples:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
3. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
4. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
5. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green

In all cases, the word immediately following ""bluf"" is translated as ""red"" in the output. Hence, we can conclude:

bluf -> rule: The word ""bluf"" dictates that the word following it should be translated to ""red"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the input-output pairs provided:

1. When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
2. When ""lug"" appears, the output includes ""blue.""
3. When ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green.""
4. The word ""walm"" results in repetition; it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated.

Looking at the provided examples:

- In the first and second instances, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" is causing the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times.
- In the third instance, ""lug dax walm wif"" gives us ""blue green green green red."" Since ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" the ""walm"" here is causing the color associated with ""dax"" to be repeated.
- In the fourth instance, ""zup walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" implying that ""walm"" caused the triplet of ""yellow"" before ""dax"" changed the color to ""green"" and ""lug"" subsequently changed it to ""blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth instance, ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green,"" showing us that ""walm"" again repeated the ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" before ""dax"" changed it to ""green.""

Considering these observations, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the provided examples, every time the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue."" There is no variation in the output associated with ""lug"" in different contexts, so the rule appears to be consistent and straightforward.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output contains the color green corresponding to its position.
From the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in a string of nonce words. Each other nonce word corresponds to a specific color based on the examples:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red

Given this information, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". This rule is consistent across all examples provided. Each subsequent word dictates a specific color pattern, as follows:

- ""walm"" repeats the color output of the prior word three times.
- ""lug"" changes the color output to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color blue.
- ""wif"" changes the color output to ""red.""
- ""dax"" changes the color output to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color green.

Therefore, ""zup"" on its own always results in ""yellow,"" while other words influence or repeat the color output in a sequence.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word before it to be repeated in the output.
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned before it for as many times until a new color (represented by another nonce word) is mentioned. If there is no subsequent color mentioned, ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned before it three times.

Let's break down each input-output pair to see the pattern:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
There's only ""zup"" before ""walm,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
Here, ""dax"" before ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" there's ""zup"" which is ""yellow."" Thus, ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times until a new color (""yellow"") appears.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
""Dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" occurs before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, followed by ""zup"" and ""lug,"" which are ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Here, ""dax"" before ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times until a new color, ""yellow"" from ""zup,"" appears, followed by ""red"" from ""wif.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and since there's no color after ""walm,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

So the rule induction for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color mentioned before ""walm"" until a new color is mentioned. If no new color follows, repeat the previous color three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" correlates to the output ""blue"" consistently, regardless of its position within the input sequence or the presence of other nonce words.

Rule: lug means blue.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" is associated with a specific color output every time it occurs. Analyzing each instance where ""wif"" is present:

1. In the sequence ""wif bluf lug dax wif,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" at both occurrences.
2. In the sequence ""dax wif lug dax,"" ""wif"" again corresponds to the color ""red.""
3. In the sequence ""dax walm wif walm,"" there is no direct color associated with ""wif,"" but based on previous examples, we can assume it's ""red."" After that, ""walm"" is repeated twice, resulting in the color ""red"" being repeated three times, which might indicate ""walm"" means to repeat the last color.
4. In the sequence ""lug wif,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
5. In the sequence ""wif dax lug,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" once again.

Each time the word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""red."" Based on this consistent correspondence, it is reasonable to conclude the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. Here's what we can deduce:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" hasn't appeared alone, but in combination with other words, it results in ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look closely at each instance where it appears and the corresponding output.

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug  
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup  
   Output: red red blue yellow

3. Input: dax bluf  
   Output: green green

4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup  
   Output: red blue blue red yellow

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup  
   Output: green green red yellow

Reviewing these sequences, we notice that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the color immediately following in the output sequence is ""blue."" This is consistent across all examples given. Additionally, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color of the word preceding it. For example:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and subsequently, there are two occurrences of ""blue"" in the output sequence (which could be indicating that ""bluf"" has caused the preceding color to repeat, as well as being represented as ""blue"" itself).
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in two ""red"" outputs before proceeding to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and the word ""bluf"" causes the output to be ""green"" twice.
- The fourth and fifth examples further confirm this pattern.

Based on these observations, here is the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word and is itself represented as ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to take on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it in the list. 

In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the corresponding color is ""yellow,"" leading ""walm"" to also be translated into ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and since ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" ""walm"" also translates to ""green.""

The third example again confirms this rule with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" and therefore ""walm"" also resulting in ""yellow.""

The fourth example shows that when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" both ""lug"" and ""walm"" translate to ""blue.""

The fifth example once again shows that the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and both words translate to ""green.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color value of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""walm"" is ""yellow."" If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""walm"" is ""green."" If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""walm"" is ""blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: wif dax wif dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.
Using the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by looking at the pattern of colors that follow it in the output.

- In the first input, every time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- In the second input, which consists only of ""dax walm,"" every word translates to ""green.""
- In the third input, both instances of ""dax"" are followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
- In the last input, which is just ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

Given that every instance of ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the words that follow, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Every instance of ""wif"" is translated into ""red"" in the output.

Given this information, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's break it down example by example to discover the rule:

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
2. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
3. Input: lug bluf dax lug
   Output: blue blue green blue
4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
5. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red

In examples 1 and 4, ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif"" and results in ""red red."" Similarly, in example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green green.""

In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and also precedes ""dax,"" which suggests that whatever rule ""bluf"" is applying to the preceding word (in this case, ""lug""), it remains consistent when it is before another color word like ""dax.""

It seems the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color that is associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Thus, when ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue."" When ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" and when ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""

To summarize, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the preceding word, duplicated.
Rule: walm amplifies the output color of the word before it, repeating it three additional times. If the word before walm is ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times after the initial blue. If the word before is ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times after the initial green. If the word before is ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times after the initial yellow. If ""walm"" appears again without an intervening color word, the last color before the first ""walm"" is repeated again three times. For ""walm"" following ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times after the initial red.

walm -> repeats the previously mentioned color three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word converts to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it. Every occurrence of ""wif"" maps to an output of ""red."" Consequently, we can deduce the following:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule holds true in each example given, as each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."" It does not depend on its position within the input sequence or on the adjacent words.

Therefore, the induction about the meaning of zup would be as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of context or position, when ""zup"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color blue. Each time ""bluf"" is used in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the subsequent colors by repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" In each example, the color that follows ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""wif"" before ""walm"" is repeated after ""walm"" for a certain number of times.

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color green (associated with ""dax"") is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" again precedes ""walm"" and green is repeated after ""walm"" three times.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and blue is repeated after ""walm"" twice.
- In the fifth example, only ""lug"" and ""walm"" are present, and blue is repeated three times after ""walm,"" the same as the number of total words in the input.

From the provided examples, the following rule can be induced:
Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" to repeat a number of times equal to the number of words remaining, including ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

1. When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue.""
2. When ""lug"" appears with ""dax"", the output for ""dax lug"" is ""green blue.""
3. When ""lug"" appears with ""zup"" and ""bluf"", the output for ""zup bluf dax lug"" is ""yellow yellow green blue.""
4. When ""lug"" is repeated along with ""walm"" and ""zup"" in the sequence ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" which suggests a pattern not based on word placement in the sequence but possibly on the word itself.

From these examples, it seems clear that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it's used.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" consistently.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word 'wif' appears to correspond with the output color 'red'. Regardless of what follows or precedes 'wif', the output includes 'red'. 

In the examples provided:
- ""dax wif"" generates the output ""green red"", suggesting 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'wif' to 'red'.
- A single ""wif"" consistently generates the output ""red"".
- ""wif lug"" generates the output ""red blue"", suggesting 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' and 'wif' to 'red'.
- ""wif walm"" generates the output ""red red red"". While it's not completely clear what 'walm' corresponds to, given that 'wif' consistently corresponds to 'red', it's possible that 'walm' might indicate a repetition of 'red'.

Given this information, the rule appears to be that the word 'wif' associates with the color 'red', regardless of its position or combination with other nonce words.

Rule: wif -> 'red'
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the occurrences of ""zup"" and the corresponding outputs.

- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow."" 
- ""zup"" on its own or followed by another word not known to lead to ""yellow"" results in ""yellow,"" as in the second example ""zup wif zup"" which produces ""yellow red yellow.""
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" is still followed by ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" again results in ""yellow.""
- ""zup dax"" produces ""yellow green,"" indicating ""dax"" is likely what causes the ""green"" color output, while ""zup"" remains consistent with ""yellow.""
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow,"" where ""zup bluf"" at the end once again corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: ""bluf"" signifies the color that the word preceding ""bluf"" corresponds to.

In each example, ""bluf"" appears immediately after a word, and the color that word represents is the same as the color immediately following ""bluf"". This indicates that ""bluf"" is a sort of placeholder for the color represented by the word that comes before it.

For instance:
- In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, thus ""bluf"" also outputs yellow.
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, thus ""bluf"" also outputs green.
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the only output after ""bluf"" is green.
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" which is ""wif,"" corresponds to red, and following ""bluf"" the output is red red.
- In ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" so the output directly after ""bluf"" is yellow again.

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, where each instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> red

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it is translated to ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax"", let's examine the provided examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
2. ""dax zup dax"" -> ""green yellow green""
3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
4. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
5. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""

From the examples, we can note that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is outputted. This is consistent across all examples, which implies ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"".

The other words, ""zup"", ""bluf"", ""walm"", and ""wif"" correlate with colors, but for our rule induction we are only focused on ""dax"".

Hence, the rule can be stated as: dax -> green. 

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green"".
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Thus, the meaning is:

zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue
Observing the outputs associated with the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word preceding it three times. Here are the patterns observed:
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""  
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug.""

In example 1, the input ""wif lug"" corresponds to the output ""red blue."" The word ""wif"" can be inferred to mean ""red"" since in all instances where ""wif"" occurs, the output includes ""red.""

So moving on, looking at examples 2 and 3:

- When ""lug bluf wif"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue red."" Since we have already established ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""bluf"" must mean ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow."" We know ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" and thus ""zup"" would indicate ""yellow"" as it's the new word corresponding to the new color in the output.

The word that remains consistent is ""lug,"" and every time it appears, the color ""blue"" comes after it. Therefore, we can deduce that ""lug"" also means ""blue."" To prove this, we can look at the fourth example:

- ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" becomes ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" ""zup"" and ""bluf"" keep their respective meanings of ""yellow"" and ""blue."" ""Dax"" is new but consistently translates to ""green"" every time it appears. ""Lug"" appears once and is followed by ""blue,"" maintaining consistency that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

In the fifth example, which is ""lug bluf dax lug,"" the output is ""blue blue green blue."" The pattern holds as ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" as we previously deduced.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify a pattern.

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the output ""green.""
- The presence of ""dax"" never corresponds to an output of ""yellow"" or ""red.""
- When ""dax"" is repeated, as in the second example (""dax zup dax""), it still corresponds to ""green"" both times.
- Other words, such as ""walm"" and ""zup,"" produce different outputs, such as ""walm"" corresponding to ""green"" when it follows ""dax,"" but ""red"" when it precedes ""dax"" in the fourth example. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" whenever it appears without ""dax"" immediately after it.
- It seems that ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green,"" whereas other words' outputs are influenced by their position relative to ""dax.""

Based on the analysis above, the rule regarding the word ""dax"" appears to be consistent and not context-dependent. The other words' meanings seem to change based on their position in relation to ""dax,"" but ""dax"" itself corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow' in each output, regardless of the context or the words that precede or follow it. Here is the observed pattern:

Input: dax zup wif zup -> Output: green yellow red yellow
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
Input: lug wif zup wif -> Output: blue red yellow red
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
Input: zup -> Output: yellow

From the above examples, it is clear that 'zup' corresponds directly to the color 'yellow,' and it is not influenced by any other elements within the sequences.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Analyzing the examples provided where the nonce word ""bluf"" is used:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   
   There is no repetition of ""dax"", ""walm"", or ""wif"" before the appearance of ""bluf"", and ""red"" appears twice after ""bluf"".
   
2. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   
   ""Wif"" is repeated once after ""bluf"" and ""lug"" is repeated once before and once after ""bluf"". In both cases, the color associated with ""wif"" and ""lug"" appears next to the word ""bluf"".
   
3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
   ""Bluf"" directly follows ""wif"", resulting in two occurrences of ""red"".

4. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
   
   ""Lug"" proceeds ""bluf"" leading to two occurrences of ""blue"".

5. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   
   ""Lug"" follows after ""bluf"", with ""blue"" repeated afterward.

Based on the examples, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that directly follows it. If there is no word following ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" seems to carry the color of the word prior to it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the following word. If there is no word following, repeat the color of the preceding word.
Walm -> Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the last word said before ""walm"" for as many times as there are letters in that preceding word.

Rule:
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and has three letters.
- ""dax wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and has three letters.
- ""wif lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and has three letters.
- ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and has three letters.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position within the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue"". Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and it appears on both sides of ""wif"" with ""red"" resulting after ""wif,"" it suggests that ""wif"" being placed before a color word changes that word to ""red.""

- ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"". Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" but there is no translation provided for ""bluf."" However, since ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"" and the output is ""red,"" it appears that ""wif"" converts the following word to ""red,"" even if the input word has no direct translation.

- ""zup wif zup"" translates to ""yellow red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" is placed between two instances of ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), turning the intermediate ""zup"" into ""red.""

- ""lug wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue red yellow red."" ""Wif"" is between ""lug"" (""blue"") and ""zup"" (""yellow""), and again between ""zup"" and the end of the sequence. Each time ""wif"" appears, it is followed by ""red.""

- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red."" Since ""wif"" is at the end after ""lug"" (""blue""), and the result is ""red,"" it reinforces that ""wif"" precedes a ""red"" regardless of the position within the sequence.

From these examples, we can determine that regardless of context when ""wif"" is used, the word immediately following it is translated to ""red."" If there's no word following ""wif"" (as in the fourth example), ""wif"" is still followed by ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> changes the following word to ""red""
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

- For each instance where ""zup"" occurs, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is used in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: Each time ""bluf"" appears, it instructs to duplicate the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. For example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and therefore ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".
Walm -> Three repetitions of the color associated with the previous word. 

Rule: When walm follows another word, the output is the color that word represents, repeated three times. For example, 'lug walm' results in 'blue blue blue' because 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'. Similarly, 'wif walm' yields 'red red red' because 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'dax walm' yields 'green green green' as 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
Input: dax wif zup -> Output: green red yellow

From the above examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input list.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""red"".

So, the rule is: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". The rule can be determined as follows:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, it is followed by ""blue"".
- When ""zup"" appears, regardless of its position in the input (beginning, middle, or end), it corresponds to ""yellow"".
- No matter the sequence, ""lug"" and ""zup"" always map to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively in the output.

Additionally:

- ""bluf"" appears to corresponds to ""yellow"" as well.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the last given example.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"", and ""yellow"" when preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup"". Rule: The color indicated by ""bluf"" depends on the word that comes before it.
To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and their outputs.

In each input-output pair, we'll look at the position of ""walm"" and the corresponding color in the output.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""blue.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""walm"" corresponds to the third ""blue.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- ""walm"" corresponds to the third ""green.""

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- ""walm"" corresponds to the third ""green.""

From these observations, we can note the following pattern:
- ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word.

To verify this, let's examine the examples again:
- In example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, and ""walm"" mirrors that with another ""blue.""
- In examples 3 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is corresponding to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, thus ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word.
- In example 5, ""dax"" again precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green."" Consequently, ""walm"" is also ""green.""

Based on the examples given, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> the meaning is that it repeats the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue"", regardless of the context or position within the sequence. Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer a rule regarding the word ""dax"" and its associated color:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every occurrence of ""dax"" in the provided examples results in the output of ""green.""
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to indicate that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is mentioned, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""green"" whenever it follows another word. However, when ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it turns into ""blue."" 

Therefore, the rule appears to be: ""bluf"" means ""green"" if another word follows it; if ""bluf"" is the last word, it means ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> ""green"" if followed by another word; ""blue"" if it is the last word in the sequence.
To deduce the rule for the word ""walm,"" let's look at each example's input alongside its output systematically:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Looking at example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output for both is ""green."" 

In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding outputs are ""blue blue."" Notably, the output sequence has two blues, perhaps signifying that ""walm"" assumes the color of the word preceding it.

Examining example 3, ""walm"" is again preceded by a color word, ""lug,"" and it yields a blue output, further supporting the previous observation. 

In examples 4 and 5, the presence of ""walm"" continues to correspond to an output color matching the word immediately before it. 

Based on these observations, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Hence, the definition is:

walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output across all examples.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each word in the input is translated to a specific color in the output, and whenever ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is outputted.
Based on the provided input and output examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This conclusion is drawn from the consistent mapping in every provided example where the input ""wif"" produces the output ""red."" Other words such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""blue"" respectively, regardless of their position in the input string.

Thus, the rule induced from the examples is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color yellow when translated into English.
Rule: 

bluf -> ""repeats the color of the preceding word"" 

If the word ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green"". 
Similarly, if ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". 
If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"". 
This rule seems consistent across all provided examples.
Rule: walm -> repeat the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the Output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" In every output, the presence of the word ""wif"" directly corresponds to the word ""red."" However, each other word appears to correspond to a different color, and the order of words in the input directly corresponds to the order of the colors in the output. Here's how it breaks down:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as seen in the first and fourth examples.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" as seen in the second and third examples.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" as evident in the second, third, and fourth examples.
- ""walm"" appears to always precede ""lug"" or ""zup"", thus doesn't seem to change the output color sequence but may indicate a repetition, as seen in the second and third examples with repetitive colors following ""walm"".
- ""bluf"" is input with ""dax"" and ""wif"" in the fifth example and the output has ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""red"" for ""wif,"" and an additional ""red"" likely for ""bluf"". 

Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: Based on the given examples, every instance of the word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

When ""bluf"" is used, it seems to produce an output that repeats the color word that immediately preceded it. Therefore, in every instance of ""bluf"", the output replicates the color of the word right before ""bluf"".

Hence, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"".

Rule: If X is a color word followed by ""bluf"", then the output for ""bluf"" will be the color word that corresponds to X.
Analyzing the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern between the input and output which will help us understand the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"".

Let's break down each example and correlate the given inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Here, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""walm"" appears between two instances of ""lug"" and gives us three ""blue"" in the output.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and again we have ""lug"" as ""blue"" followed by ""walm"" which produces two additional ""blue"".

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""wif"" which produces two more ""green"" and, when followed by ""wif"", results in two additional ""red"".

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Once again, ""wif"" as ""red"", ""lug"" as ""blue"", and ""dax"" as ""green"". ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to two extra ""green"".

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   And here, ""dax"" leads to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" follows ""wif"" giving us two additional ""red"".

Based on these observations, we can infer the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that precedes it two more times.

So, we can state the rule as:

walm -> meaning: Replicates the preceding color's name two additional times.

Now, to put the rule into the requested format:

Rule: walm -> meaning: If ""walm"" follows a color word, the output will contain that color word repeated two more times. If ""walm"" follows ""lug"", there will be two additional ""blue""; if it follows ""dax"", two additional ""green""; if it follows ""wif"", two additional ""red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in all given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.
Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, each input word correlates with a specific color in the output. Matching the words to their colors shows a pattern:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red

Even though bluf is a nonce word, it consistently corresponds to the color red in each output whenever it appears.

Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word three times.

Rule:
When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the color outputted is the same as the color corresponding to the previous word and it is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given context.
Based on the given examples, the following rules can be deduced:

1. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green.""
2. The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"" when it follows ""dax.""
3. The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" and seems to maintain this output regardless of its position in the input sequence after ""dax.""
4. The word ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""red,"" and its output is repeated as many times as it appears in the input sequence after ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: dax -> green

Furthermore, when combined with other words, ""dax"" seems to maintain its meaning, while the other words add their respective colors to the output sequence. This layered meaning suggests a pattern of direct translation from each input word to a specified color in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Observing the given examples, we can see that each instance of ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"". There is no instance where ""zup"" corresponds to a different color or a change based on context. Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: 'bluf' repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Examples supporting the rule:
- In ""zup bluf"", 'zup' is associated with yellow, thus 'bluf' also translates to yellow.
- In ""wif bluf"", 'wif' is associated with red, so 'bluf’ is also red.
- In ""dax bluf"", 'dax' is associated with green, hence 'bluf' is also green.

Therefore, bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
Considering the provided inputs and corresponding outputs, we can try to identify the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Based on the examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" always precedes a sequence of three identical colors. Additionally, we can observe that the colors correspond to the word that comes before ""walm."" Let's try to find a pattern for each word:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three reds: red red red.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three greens: green green green.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three yellows: yellow yellow yellow.

Given these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to be repeated three times. The color is determined by the preceding word, not ""walm"" itself.

Hence, the answer would be:

walm -> Causes the next color to be repeated three times according to the previous word's associated color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: lug zup walm dax lug
    ",Output: blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,True,151
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug translates to the word ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word 'dax' is consistently translated to the color 'green'. Here's a breakdown of how this is determined:

1. In every instance where the word 'dax' appears, the output is 'green', regardless of the words that come before or after it.

2. The word 'dax' does not seem to be context-dependent; its association with 'green' is constant.

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: 'dax' -> 'green'
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be simple: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the context provided by other words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. All instances where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule deduced is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can observe the patterns in which the nonce word ""bluf"" is used and its corresponding output. Each example provides a sequence of words including ""bluf"" and a corresponding sequence of colors:

1. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
5. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue

Analyzing the data:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue"". This could initially suggest that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"", but we should confirm with the other examples.
- In example 2, the output corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""red"", which conflicts with the previous assumption if we consider ""bluf"" to strictly mean ""blue"". This indicates that ""bluf"" does not always translate directly to ""blue"".
- In example 3, ""bluf"" occurs between ""zup"" and ""wif"", with the output colors before and after ""bluf"" being ""yellow"" and ""red"", respectively. This further suggests ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color meaning.
- In example 4, again ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""blue"" but to ""green"" instead.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" just like in the first example, but this time the color ""blue"" appears twice after ""bluf"". 

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" might not correspond to a specific color but to a rule that depends on the context in which it's used. One possible rule could be that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it:

- ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif bluf dax"" -> since ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".
- ""zup bluf wif"" -> since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> since ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""bluf"" translates to ""green"".
- ""wif lug bluf"" -> since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.

For instance:
- In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the word ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times.
- In the second example, ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Again ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated, and then the sequence continues with the translations for ""dax"" and ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" replicates the ""yellow"" that follows ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" is repeating the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" two more times before following with ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" once again showing that ""walm"" repeats the color that is next to it.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated two additional times.

Therefore: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Here's how we can analyze the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to affect its corresponding output color.
- No other word in the inputs consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs, so it is unique to ""dax.""

Given this information, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples given, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the pattern of the colors in the outputs. Here’s the analysis:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"". In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output color also changes to ""red red"". This pattern suggests that the color for ""bluf"" could be influenced by the word that precedes it.

- When looking at the third, fourth, and fifth examples, we can notice that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the second part of the output repeats the color output of the word right before ""bluf"". 

Considering the pattern observed, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color output of the word that comes right before it in the input sequence.

So:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning is that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that appears immediately before it in the list.
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to correspond to a color, and repeating that color as many times as the word is repeated:

- ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue""
- ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green""

When ""walm"" is introduced after any of these words, the output repeats the color associated with the previous nonce word, but the number of repetitions is equal to the number of occurrences of ""walm"" plus the repetition of the color linked to the word before it. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green."" The ""walm"" repeats the green associated with ""dax"" two additional times.
2. ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green."" The ""walm"" repeats the blue associated with ""lug"" two more times.
3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" must contain a typographical error (bluf is not translated), but following the pattern, we ignore ""bluf"" and the ""walm"" repeats the yellow associated with ""zup"" five times in total.
4. ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue."" The ""walm"" repeats the blue associated with ""lug"" two more times
5. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" The ""walm"" repeats the green associated with ""dax"" two additional times.

If we generalize this rule, ""walm"" seems to function as an instruction to repeat the color of the preceding word multiple times, with the number of repetitions being the count of ""walm"" plus one.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word as many times as the count of ""walm"" plus one repetition.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The examples all consistently translate ""lug"" to ""blue"".
It appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, whenever ""dax"" appears, the output consistently includes the color ""green.""

Thus, the rule is: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word wif consistently corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" It does not appear to change meaning based on its placement within a sequence of other words. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of context within the provided sequences.
From the given examples, we can induce the rule for the word bluf by analyzing the sequences and their corresponding outputs:

- Example 1: Whenever bluf follows dax, the output for bluf is blue.
- Example 2: bluf does not follow a specific word and the output is green.
- Example 3: bluf follows zup and the output is yellow.
- Example 4: bluf follows zup and the output is yellow.
- Example 5: bluf follows zup and the output is yellow.

Based on these examples, it is possible to create a tentative rule for the nonce word bluf:

When bluf follows a specific word, the output is the same as the output for that specific word. If bluf does not directly follow a specific word, the output is green.

However, in all cases, there is no instance where we have a different word directly before bluf aside from either dax or zup to test against. To strengthen the rule, it should be seen what happens when **bluf** is preceded by wif, walm, or lug too. But with the provided examples, a more precise rule is:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning here is either the color displayed by the word immediately preceding it, if there is one, or green if it follows a word whose associated color is not shown immediately before it.

Let's illustrate the rule with the examples:

1. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   - bluf follows wif, which doesn't have a color, but the word dax (which is colored green) is seen just before wif. Therefore, bluf takes the color of dax, which is green.

2. zup dax bluf zup dax
   - bluf follows dax (green) without any intervening word, so it would be expected to also be green as per the proposed rule.

3. zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   - bluf follows zup (yellow) without any intervening word, hence it is yellow.

4. zup bluf wif lug dax
   - bluf follows zup (yellow) without any intervening word, hence it is yellow.

5. zup bluf wif walm
   - bluf follows zup (yellow) without any intervening word, hence it is yellow.

Thus, the rule seems consistent across the examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns:

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""bluf"" corresponds to red
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red

We can observe that the color that appears after ""walm"" is always the same as the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. 

For example, in ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the color following ""walm"" is also green, before it changes to red for ""wif.""

Similarly, in ""lug walm wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the color following ""walm"" is also blue before it changes to red for ""wif."" 

Rule:
walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, it translates to the color ""yellow."" There is no additional context to change the meaning of ""zup"" regardless of its position or repetition. Hence, ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every single instance of the word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> repeating the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: The output is a sequence of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm,"" repeated three times. For example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word 'dax' occurs in the input, the word 'green' is present in the output at the corresponding position. There is no example where 'dax' does not translate to 'green', thus the meaning of 'dax' is deduced to be 'green.'
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The outputs are sequences of colors and each input seems to contribute to one color in the output. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output sequence.

Based on the examples:

- ""dax walm wif zup"" maps to ""green green red yellow"".
- ""lug dax wif"" maps to ""blue green red"".
- ""dax lug wif bluf"" maps to ""green blue red red"".
- ""wif dax"" maps to ""red green"".
- ""wif zup"" maps to ""red yellow"".

Given that ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input, we can deduce the following:

wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
To decipher the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine its placement and the resulting output colors in each example:

1. dax zup -> green yellow
2. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Analyzing the examples, it seems that ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems to be consistent and not dependent on context.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the output patterns that correspond with its appearance:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" yields repeated reds (same number of reds as the position of ""walm"" in the input, counting from one):
   - Example: ""dax walm"" -> green green green
   - Example: ""wif dax walm zup"" -> (ignored) green red red red (ignored)

2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red repeated as before:
   - Example: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red (ignored) (ignored)

3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it changes the output to blue just in the case of ""lug"":
   - Example: ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
   - Example: ""dax lug wif walm"" -> (ignored) blue red red red

4. When ""walm"" appears without ""dax"" or ""wif"" immediately before it, the outputs for ""walm"" and each word preceding it, up to the previous instance of ""dax"", ""wif"", or the start of the sentence, are blue:
   - Example: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> yellow blue blue blue (ignored) (ignored)
   - Example: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> yellow (ignored) (ignored) green green
     - Note: The previous rule seems to override this one when ""walm"" follows ""dax"".

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to influence the output color based on its position and the preceding word. The rule appears to be: ""The output for 'walm' is red repeated according to its position in the sequence after 'dax' or 'wif'. When following 'lug', 'walm' changes previous outputs to blue up to but not including the last 'dax' or 'wif'. When 'lug' immediately precedes 'walm', the output for both is blue.""

Rule: walm -> modifies the output colors based on its position and neighboring words according to the specified patterns.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples given, the meaning of ""dax"" is consistent across all instances and appears to be independent of its position or the surrounding words. Whenever the nonce word ""dax"" is presented in the input, the output color associated with it is always green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, this is the pattern that appears to be associated with the nonce word ""wif"" and other words:

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""wif"" alone outputs ""red"".

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
- ""wif"" outputs ""red""; ""dax"" follows and outputs ""green"".

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" outputs ""yellow""; ""bluf"" produces another ""yellow"". ""wif"" again yields ""red"", and ""walm"" seems to have a pattern, repeating the color given before it two more times (thus three ""red"").

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- ""wif"" leads with ""red""; ""bluf"" follows with another ""red""; ""lug"" shifts to ""blue"", and ""zup"" closes with ""yellow"".

Input: zup wif dax
Output: yellow red green
- ""zup"" begins with ""yellow""; ""wif"" outputs ""red"" once again, and ""dax"" results in ""green"".

In every case, no matter the position, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Therefore, we can determine that:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

In each example, the appearance of the word ""bluf"" causes the following word's color to be repeated. For instance:

- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green red green yellow yellow,"" so bluf causes the preceding ""zup"" (or ""yellow"") to be repeated.
- ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow,"" so here again, bluf causes the preceding ""zup"" (or ""yellow"") to be repeated.
- ""zup dax bluf"" outputs ""yellow green green,"" so bluf causes the preceding ""dax"" (or ""green"") to be repeated.
- ""zup wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow red red,"" which shows bluf causing the preceding ""wif"" (or ""red"") to be repeated.
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" outputs ""green blue blue red,"" which means that not only does bluf cause repetition, but it doesn't prevent the subsequent color (""red"") associated with ""wif"" from being included as well.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be written as follows:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated in the output.
To determine what ""walm"" means, we need to identify any patterns in the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
3. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow

We can notice the following:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output, but not at the same position.
- In examples 1 and 3, which are the same, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", and the output sequence ends with green. ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"", and all previous colors are red.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""wif"" (red), with the output being ""blue"" before ""walm"" and ""red"" after.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by ""zup"" (yellow), and again the output is ""blue"" before and ""yellow"" after.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue), and again the output before ""walm"" is red and after is blue.

From these observations, a rule seems to emerge: ""walm"" causes an out of sequence repetition of the color before it (in the input-output mapping) to follow it in the output, whereas its own position in the output results in a color that would naturally follow the word after it in the input-output mapping.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"", whereas its own position in the output corresponds to the color that would follow the word after ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Based on the provided examples, it appears that each unique word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in each example it is used.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Rule: wif -> red. The meaning of ""wif"" in the examples corresponds consistently with the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color blue in each instance it occurs. For every input that contains the word ""bluf,"" the corresponding output includes the color blue at the same position. Thus, we can deduce the following:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times.

    Rules:

Rule: lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Observing the outputs that correspond to the input containing the nonce word ""wif,"" we are looking for a pattern. Here's the breakdown of instances where ""wif"" is used and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: zup wif zup dax
   Output: yellow red yellow green
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: lug dax wif
   Output: blue green red
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

In all cases, regardless of position in the sentence or the surrounding words, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Based on this data, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples.

Example 1:
Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Observation: The word ""zup"" appears at both the beginning and the end of the input sequence, and in both cases, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" 

Example 2:
Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

Observation: ""zup"" is at the beginning, and the first color is ""yellow."" The other words do not have a ""yellow"" associated with them.

Example 3:
Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Observation: Again, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow."" 

Example 4:
Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green

Observation: In the middle of the sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Example 5:
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Observation: When ""zup"" starts the input sequence, the first color is ""yellow.""

By examining the consistent association of ""zup"" with the color ""yellow"" across all examples, regardless of its position in the sequence, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" implying that ""bluf"" is repeating the color for ""dax"" (green).
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" again indicating repetition of the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue).
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup"" (yellow).

Rule: 
bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf"".
walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word until a different word (wif) alters the pattern. If no word follows to change the pattern, ""walm"" continues the repetition of the associated color indefinitely.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. If followed by ""wif,"" a red color is inserted into the sequence, altering the pattern. If followed by ""bluf,"" a red color is also added to the sequence, suggesting that there may be a class of words that, when following ""walm,"" introduce a red color to the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the output contains the word ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds with the word ""green"" in the output. The context or the words surrounding ""dax"" have no effect on its translation to ""green.""
From the examples provided, we can deduce the following associative patterns:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the term ""red"" is included in the output.
- The position of ""wif"" doesn't seem to matter; it always corresponds to ""red"":
  - ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
  - ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
- Multiple instances where ""wif"" is surrounded by other words still result in ""red"":
  - ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" (note that ""walm"" hasn't appeared elsewhere, so it's not clear which part of the output it corresponds to, but we can confirm it doesn't affect ""wif"")
  - ""lug dax wif lug"" -> ""blue green red blue"" (even though the surrounding words ""lug"" and ""dax"" have their colors, ""wif"" remains ""red"")
  - ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (this example confirms that ""wif"" remains consistently ""red"" and ""bluf"" is also associated with ""red"")

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. There is a consistent pattern where a given input word corresponds to the same output color across all examples. To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the outputs where it appears and look for the consistent color that follows it.

Looking at the patterns:

- ""zup"" in ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"", but since ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in other examples, ""zup"" must correspond to ""yellow"".
- ""lug dax zup wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow red"". Here, ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""wif"" with ""red"", which leaves ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- ""wif walm dax zup"" gives us ""red red red green yellow"". Since ""wif"" aligns with ""red"", ""walm"" also seems to align with ""red"" when its position in the sequence is considered, ""dax"" aligns with ""green"", leaving ""zup"" as ""yellow"".
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" to ""green"" based on their positions, reinforcing ""zup"" as ""yellow"".
- ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" apparently to ""yellow"" based on this sequence, confirming ""zup"" as ""yellow"".

From these examples, it's clear that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue.""
From the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. In the examples where ""walm"" is not directly preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax,"" the output is ""red red red.""

Additionally, we see that ""wif"" and ""zup"" translate to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively in the output, and the positions of these words in the inputs and outputs correspond directly.

Given these patterns, it seems like ""walm"" being preceded by certain words changes its meaning. Let's construct a rule based on this information:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax,"" to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug,"" and to ""red"" in other cases (or when not directly preceded by these specific words).

So, the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the context as follows:

walm -> meaning:
- After ""dax"": ""green""
- After ""lug"": ""blue""
- Otherwise or elsewhere: ""red""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" invariably translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input string.
From the provided examples, we can try to infer a rule for the meaning of ""dax"". We observe that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is related to the color green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is again related to the color green.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" continues to correspond to green.

When ""dax"" is used in different positions within the input, it consistently maps to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule we can derive based on the given examples is:

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs provided.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" as well, suggested by the second and third examples.
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" is in the sequence; its corresponding output is always ""yellow"". Assuming ""zup"" has a consistent meaning across all contexts provided by these examples, it appears that:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue

The examples show that every time the word ""bluf"" is used, the output is ""blue,"" regardless of the context or position in the sequence.
walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, the output color is repeated for as many times as ""walm"" is stated. If ""walm"" is stated multiple times consecutively, continue repeating the color for the total count of ""walm"" occurrences.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in every given example.
To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look for a pattern that correlates the word with its corresponding output across the given examples.

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red green."" 
2. In the second example, ""wif"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""zup,"" producing ""red yellow,"" and at the end, followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red green.""
3. In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" twice, producing ""red green"" both times, and is followed by ""zup"" once, resulting in ""red yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" yielding ""red red red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" resulting in ""red yellow yellow.""

Based on the outputs, we can see that whenever ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to ""red."" 

There is no instance where ""wif"" directly precedes a different output. The words following ""wif"" (""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"") correspond with other output colors (""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red""), but ""wif"" itself consistently corresponds with ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to be a modifier that changes the color associated with the word that follows it. To determine the rule for what ""bluf"" means, we can compare the output colors from the examples given where ""bluf"" is used and the corresponding word that follows it.

Considering the examples:
- wif bluf -> red red
- dax bluf -> green green
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow

In each case, the word following ""bluf"" gets the same color as it would have had if it were not preceded by ""bluf."" However, ""bluf"" repeats the color, effectively duplicating it.

Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" repeats the color assigned to the following word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the following word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us look at each input and its corresponding output and try to identify patterns.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" might be triple of the color that precedes it.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"" again, followed by ""walm"" which translates into ""red red red,"" supporting our initial observation that ""walm"" might repeat the color that precedes it three times. ""lug"" is followed by a single ""blue"" again, and ""bluf"" seems to introduce another ""blue,"" though this was not in the first input to observe patterns for ""bluf.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" producing ""green green green,"" following our established pattern of ""walm"" repeating the preceding color three times.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Here ""wif"" produces ""red,"" ""dax"" yields ""green,"" and ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" again tripling the preceding color to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the preceding ""green"" three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Meaning: ""Walm"" causes a triplet repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color green in the output. Every time ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is present in the exact same position in the output. This suggests that the rule is consistent irrespective of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples given, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" There is a one-to-one correspondence with no variation observed; hence, we can infer that ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, each utterance in the input corresponds with a specific color in the output. Given the consistent appearance of ""zup"" with the color ""yellow,"" we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates specifically to the color ""yellow.""  

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we observe that the output sequence changes color depending on the presence and position of certain words in the input sequence. Here's what we can gather from each example:

1. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" repeated the color linked to ""dax.""
2. ""wif bluf dax"" yields ""red red green,"" where ""bluf"" repeated the color of ""wif"" before the color for ""dax"" is shown.
3. ""dax zup bluf"" turns into ""green yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" repeating the color of ""zup.""
4. ""lug wif bluf"" becomes ""blue red red,"" with ""bluf"" repeating the color of ""wif.""
5. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" duplicating the color sequence of ""dax zup.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" repeats the color or colors of the words immediately preceding it. More formally:

Rule: bluf repeats the sequence of colors corresponding to the words right before it.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word thrice.

Based on the given input and output pairs, ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" three times.

- In the first and third examples, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" after ""dax"" (which corresponds to the color green), results in the color ""green"" being repeated three times.
- Similarly, in the fourth example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which means that ""walm"" after ""wif"" (which corresponds to the color red), results in the color ""red"" being repeated three times.
- In the second example, we see the sequence ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" meaning that ""walm"" after ""lug"" (corresponding to blue) causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times. The word ""wif"" appears later without ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the final example, ""wif walm dax zup"" leads to ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""wif walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times, and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" 

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. 

Rule: lug means blue.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" has a consistent correlation with the color ""red"". Every time ""wif"" appears in an input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. There are no examples where ""wif"" corresponds to a different color or set of colors. Furthermore, ""wif"" appears to maintain its meaning regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Thus, we can formulate the rule as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in every instance of its use.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.
Based on the examples given:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow""
- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red""
- ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""

We could deduce that the word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the preceding color word.
Based on the provided examples, we need to figure out what the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to in terms of the output colors. Let's analyze each example one by one:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red""
2. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow""
3. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""

Looking at these examples:

- In the 1st and 4th example, each occurrence of ""walm"" results in three of the same color (red and green, respectively), suggesting ""walm"" means to repeat the last color mentioned.
  
- The 2nd example reinforces this idea because ""walm"" after ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) leads to three greens.

- The 3rd example shows ""lug wif dax zup,"" followed by ""walm,"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" corresponds with yellow, and following ""walm,"" we see three yellows.

- The 5th example again shows the last mentioned color, yellow after ""zup,"" is repeated three times after the word ""walm"" is used.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is generated in the output.
To determine the rule for what ""dax"" means, let's look at the pattern where it occurs and the corresponding output:

Input: dax zup bluf              - Output: green yellow yellow
Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif  - Output: blue green yellow green green green red
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif  - Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
Input: dax                       - Output: green
Input: lug wif dax zup walm      - Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

In each instance where the word ""dax"" is used, the output is invariably ""green"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the context provided by other words. Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" consistently correlates to the output ""green"", independent of other factors.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This appears to be a consistent translation in all given examples, as ""wif"" always results in ""red"" no matter its position within the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" dictates the following behavior: Repeat the color of the preceding word and then append ""red"". Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated and then ""yellow"" follows, which appears to come from the word ""zup"". Hence, ""bluf"" repeats ""red"" due to the preceding ""wif"" and appends ""red"".

- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated and followed by ""red.""

- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated and followed by ""red.""

- In the fourth and fifth examples, regardless of the preceding word (whether ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" or ""dax"" corresponding to ""green""), the pattern after ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word and append ""red.""

Hence the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word, then add red.
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Explanation: In every instance, the word ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

For instance:
- In ""dax walm wif walm zup"", ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times. Similarly, ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times. Then ""wif"" correlates to ""red"".
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times without any color following it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,165
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, every time the word 'lug' is used in the input, it seems to correspond to the word 'blue' in the output. It doesn't change regardless of the position of 'lug' in the sequence or the other words surrounding it. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. We'll examine each case and note the color output associated with ""wif"" and the context it appears in:

1. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" yields ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"".
   The word before ""wif"" is ""lug"" (blue), and the word after is ""dax"" (green).

2. ""lug wif dax"" yields ""blue red green"".
   Again, ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""wif"", and ""dax"" (green) follows it.

3. ""zup wif zup dax"" yields ""yellow red yellow green"".
   Here, ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""wif"", followed by another ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green).

4. ""dax zup dax zup wif"" yields ""green yellow green yellow red"".
   In this case, ""wif"" is at the end, following ""zup"" (yellow).

5. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" yields ""yellow green green green blue red"".
   Here, ""wif"" is at the end and follows ""lug"" (blue).

Looking at these examples, ""wif"" is always associated with the color ""red"" in the output. It does not seem to matter which words precede or follow ""wif""; the output color for ""wif"" is consistently ""red"". Based on this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence of words.
Based on the examples given, ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to the same color as the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how the rule works:

- In the first example, ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""dax,"" both of which translate to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively. ""Bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word, which is ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""green green red blue."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green,"" the same color corresponding to ""dax.""

- The fourth example is identical to the second one, further reinforcing the rule.

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow,"" which is the same as the word ""zup.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that comes immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' is a rule that repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it for a set number of times. Let's look at the examples to understand the pattern:

- In the first example, 'zup walm dax lug' outputs 'yellow yellow yellow green blue'. Since 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and 'walm' follows 'zup', the output is three 'yellow's followed by 'green' and 'blue' which correspond to 'dax' and 'lug' respectively.

- In the second example, 'lug walm dax' results in 'blue blue blue green', wherein 'lug' corresponds to blue, and again, the output repeats 'blue' three times, followed by 'green' for 'dax'.

- The third example, 'zup walm lug', gives us an output of 'yellow yellow yellow blue', with 'zup' corresponding to yellow and 'lug' to blue. 'Walm' repeats the yellow color.

- In the fourth example, 'wif walm lug bluf', the output is 'red red red blue blue', where 'wif' corresponds to red, 'lug' to blue, and 'walm' results in repeating red three times.

- Finally, in the last example, 'wif zup lug dax zup walm', we get 'red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow', so here 'walm' repeats the color yellow, which corresponds to 'zup' that comes before it and it occurs three times again.

The pattern suggests that 'walm' indicates a repetition of the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> 'walm' results in repeating the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,166
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
This problem seems to involve deducing the color that the word ""lug"" corresponds to based on a series of examples. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, it is associated with a particular color in the output. By examining the examples, we can attempt to ascertain the color or rule that ""lug"" represents.

Let's go through the inputs and their respective outputs one by one:

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red
- ""lug"" appears twice and is translated to ""blue"" both times.

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red
- ""lug"" appears once and is translated to ""blue.""

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""lug"" appears twice at the beginning, each time followed by ""wif,"" and translated to ""blue."" Also, ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" which is translated as ""blue"" once again.

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- ""lug"" appears once at the end and is translated to ""blue.""

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
- ""lug"" appears once in the middle and is translated to ""blue.""

Based on these examples, every occurrence of ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Observing the examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Here is the deduction:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
    - dax corresponds to green.

2. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
    - dax corresponds to green.

3. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
    - dax corresponds to green.

4. dax -> green
    - dax corresponds to green.

5. lug dax zup dax wif -> blue green yellow green red
    - dax corresponds to green.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> meaning.

Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"". The position of ""wif"" in the input (whether it is before or after ""zup"") does not alter its corresponding output. Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and their position affects the order of the colors in the output, it’s clear that each word is associated with a specific color regardless of order.

Rule: The word ""wif"" means ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Bluf -> yellow when following the word ""zup,"" and red when following the word ""wif."" Rule: Bluf takes on the color associated with the word preceding it.
walm -> three consecutive instances of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"".

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" follows another word, the output is three consecutive instances of the color that is associated with the preceding word.

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the color corresponding to ""wif"" is red, so the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the color for ""zup"" is yellow, resulting in the output ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and thus the output includes ""yellow yellow yellow"" after the color sequence for ""lug wif lug"", which is ""blue red blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color for ""dax"" is green, leading to an output of ""green green green"" after ""wif bluf"", which translates to ""red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and so the output includes ""blue blue blue"" after ""wif zup bluf"", which corresponds to ""red yellow yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. Here's how the words seem to match with colors:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Inspecting the position of ""dax"" and the corresponding color outputs, we can deduce that ""dax"" also corresponds to a specific color:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and the output color is green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug"" with output colors red and blue, and the color for ""dax"" is green.
- In the third example, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and the output color for ""dax"" is green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif"" with output colors yellow and red, and the color for ""dax"" is green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is at the end, and the color output for ""dax"" is green.

From this, it is consistent that ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, each non-wif word corresponds to a unique color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow (same as zup)
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue (same as bluf)

The word ""wif"" always results in the color ""red,"" regardless of the position of the word ""wif"" in the input sequence or which words come before or after it.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Given the presented examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" has a direct mapping to a color that is dependent on the word that precedes it in the sequence. Specifically, ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word just before it. Here is the rule based on the data:

- When ""zup"" is before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
- When ""wif"" is before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- ""dax"" has been seen to output ""green"", but it does not precede ""bluf"" in the given examples, so there's no definite rule for ""dax"" followed by ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the precedent word in the sequence. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow""; if ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"", with the number of repetitions equal to the number of letters in the color word. Here's the breakdown of each example:

- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
    - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which has four letters. Thus, ""walm"" is repeated four times as ""blue.""

- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which has five letters. ""walm"" is repeated five times as ""green.""

- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
    - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which has six letters. ""walm"" is repeated six times as ""yellow.""

- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
    - The second ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" meaning ""green"" is repeated five times after it.

- ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red""
    - The second ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" translating to ""blue,"" which has four letters hence repeating four times.
    - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" before the second ""walm,"" and since ""yellow"" has six letters, it is repeated six times.

Rule: walm -> repeated color from the preceding word, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of letters in the color's name.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
From analyzing the examples given, each time the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green."" Therefore, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples and their corresponding outputs, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced. Each occurrence of ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. No matter its position in the input sequence, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the same color in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the meaning of the word ""walm"":

1. The appearance of ""walm"" always results in the output of multiple instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"".
2. The number of color repetitions seems to be exactly three in every instance of ""walm"" being used in the examples.

Therefore, we can deduce that when ""walm"" follows any word, it means to repeat the output color of that word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previously mentioned color three times.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red."" Independent of its position in the sequence of words in the input, ""wif"" consistently results in the output of the color ""red.""

Thus, the rule can be defined as:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, anytime ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is produced in the output, regardless of the position or surrounding words. This direct one-to-one correspondence indicates that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Based on the examples given:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"", as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"", as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"", as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Therefore, bluf -> a repetition of the preceding color.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with a repetition of the color indicated by the word that precedes ""walm."" 

Here's the pattern that these examples suggest:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which indicates that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""walm"" means repeating the color thrice.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" means ""red"" and again, ""walm"" means repeating the color three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""walm"" leads to the threefold repetition of the color.

Regardless of the preceding word, ""walm"" consistently results in tripling the output associated with the preceding word's color. 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word is corresponding to a unique color. We have the following color associations:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue

The rule appears to be that each nonce word directly maps to a specific color as an output. Hence:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red (The output for ""wif"" is consistently ""red"" in all given examples.)
zup -> meaning. Based on the examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"".
Examining the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the underlying rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red
- Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" both times, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow
- ""bluf"" follows ""green"" and precedes ""yellow"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and ""red"" follows immediately after, and before ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which is ""red"", and before ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" is at the end after ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and there are two ""yellow""s in the output.

From these patterns, we observe that ""bluf"" doesn't have a consistent color output. Instead, it appears to be a function of its position or the word it follows. Notably:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".

Given these observations, we can conclude that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze each input-output pair for patterns:

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif

4. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Considering the outputs immediately following each occurrence of ""walm,"" it appears that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color word immediately preceding ""walm."" For instance, in example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by the word ""green"" repeatedly. Similarly, in example 4 and 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and leads to a series of ""green"" in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Using this rule:

- In example 1, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 2, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 4, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" and again ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In example 5, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" again.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given examples is to repeat the color mentioned before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in an input, the output includes the word ""green"" at the corresponding position. There doesn't seem to be any dependency on the context or position of ""dax"" in the sentence for it to mean ""green"". 

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the first noun in the input. 

In each example, the word ""bluf"" yields an output that is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the noun preceding it:

- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- wif bluf -> red red

Based on these examples, it appears the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color output that is associated with the word directly before it.
walm -> three repetitions of the color that precedes it.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word (such as ""lug"" for blue, or ""zup"" for yellow), it causes that color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word 'lug' appears in the input, it corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" as every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Observing the patterns in the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. The output repeats the color named after the previous word whenever ""bluf"" appears. For example:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is again ""red red.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""

Based on this consistent pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word in the output.
walm -> meaning: the color yellow repeated three times

Rule: Whenever the word 'walm' appears in the input, the output is the color yellow repeated three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The examples provided consistently show that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug means blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the nonce word ""dax"" is directly translated to the word ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The surrounding words do not affect the translation of ""dax""; it consistently means ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color. By analyzing patterns and the corresponding output colors, we can deduce the following associations:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" (Note: Same color as ""lug"")

Observing the word ""wif"" and its resulting colors in the outputs, we can conclude the following:

- In the first example, the word ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and results in ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is before ""lug"" and the result is again ""red"" in the output.
- In the third example, the word ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" (which is ""blue"") and produces ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is between two ""bluf"" words and is once again followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" (which is ""green"") and by ""bluf"" (which is ""blue""), and both instances result in ""red"" in the output.

Considering these examples, we can determine that regardless of its position or the word that follows it, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently translates to ""yellow"" in each provided example, regardless of its position or the other words around it.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""

Additionally, it appears that ""bluf"" also affects the following word (if there is one) by repeating its color. For instance, after ""bluf lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" demonstrating the repetition.

Rule: bluf -> ""Repeat the color of the preceding word and if another word follows, also repeat that color.""
Based on the provided examples where ""walm"" is used in different contexts with accompanying outputs of repeated colors, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely means to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the output includes the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently. Every input that contains ""wif"" results in the color red being part of the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Given the examples provided, we need to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

In this example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green

Here, ""bluf"" again corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output sequence.

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

""bluf"" in this sequence is aligned with the penultimate ""green.""

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

In this case, ""bluf"" translates to the second ""blue"" after its occurrence.

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

And in this final example, ""bluf"" results in the second ""red"" in the output.

Based on the given examples, one might observe that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color in the sequence, matching the color that immediately follows its occurrence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that directly follows it in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to consider the contexts in which it appears and the corresponding outputs. Below are the input-output pairs with an analysis to help determine the meaning of ""walm.""

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup 
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   Here, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and ""wif,"" leading to a repeated ""green"" output, and again after ""wif,"" leading to a repeated ""red"" output.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" resulting in a repetition of the color ""red.""

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   In this case, ""walm"" comes at the end after ""zup,"" leading to a repeat of ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we see a repetition of ""green.""

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Finally, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated.

The pattern that emerges is that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" There is no variation in the output associated with the appearance of ""lug,"" irrespective of its position or the other words present in the input.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in every given example.
Rule: wif -> red
Let's analyze the examples to deduce the rule:

1. lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

2. lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue

3. zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. zup lug wif dax lug
   Output: yellow blue red green blue

5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Looking at the patterns, there are occurrences where words are followed by a 'zup'. In all instances, 'zup' seems to make the word that follows it produce the color yellow. Also, when 'zup' precedes a word, it also turns it to yellow. In cases where 'zup' is in between two non-zup words, it seems to affect only the word that comes after it. In the only instance where 'zup' does not follow or is not followed by another word (Output 3), it produces yellow on its own.

Based on these observations, it seems that 'zup' changes the color associated with the next word to yellow, or it produces yellow when it is standalone.

Rule: zup -> changes the following word's associated color to yellow or produces yellow itself when not followed by another word.
Rule:

To determine what ""bluf"" means, it's necessary to observe the pattern of word-to-color correspondences in the given input and output pairings.

Looking at the examples:

- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" maps to ""red red red,"" suggesting it expands to three reds or repeats the color red thrice.
- The word ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" maps to ""blue blue,"" suggesting it doubles the color or repeats blue twice.
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it adds a single additional ""red"" after all other patterned colors are accounted for.

Therefore, based on the outputs provided:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""zup"" turns to double ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" adds a single ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" adds a single ""red"" afterward.
- When ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, after all the corresponding colors are generated, it simply adds a single ""red.""

Thus the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" adds a single ""red"" to the sequence of colors generated by the other words.

bluf -> ""red"" (Adds a single ""red"" to the sequence)
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: ""dax"" means ""green"".
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"":

1. dax lug wif lug -> green blue red blue
2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
4. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
5. dax zup wif zup -> green yellow red yellow

In each instance, the word ""wif"" is translated to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" translates to the color yellow consistently in every instance where it appears. Hence, the rule can be concluded as:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" serves as a repeated output of the color term that immediately precedes it.

1. wif bluf -> red red
   The word ""wif"" is outputted as ""red,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which repeats the color ""red.""

2. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" that follows repeats ""yellow."" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and again ""bluf"" that follows repeats ""blue.""

3. wif bluf -> red red
   Similar to the first example, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which repeats ""red.""

4. lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red
   Here, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" The ""bluf"" following ""wif"" repeats ""red,"" and the pattern continues accordingly.

5. lug bluf -> blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats this color.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" acts as a repeater of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's how the rule seems to work:

- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue, three times.
  
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
  
- For ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" the ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" which associates with yellow. So, ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times.

Additionally, when ""walm"" occurs directly after another instance of ""walm,"" it does not repeat the word ""walm"" itself but continues to repeat the color associated with the word preceding the first ""walm."" For example, in ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" we have ""green"" being repeated three times for the first ""walm"" due to ""dax"" and after ""wif"" we have ""walm"" repeating ""red"" three times.

This suggests an overarching rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times. If there is no word before ""walm"" or if the context of the non-color word is ambiguous, the rule might not apply. However, based on the examples provided, it is always preceded by a color-associated word.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Rule: The word ""dax"" connotes the color green.
By analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the rules for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"".

Example 1:
Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
Here the word ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Example 2:
Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
In this string, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" precedes another ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". But before the second ""dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Example 3:
Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
Here ""walm"" appears to correspond to the sequence ""red yellow yellow yellow"". ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", and the corresponding output for ""wif"" is ""red"".

Example 4:
Input: lug dax lug wif
Output: blue green blue red
Both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" at the end of the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Example 5:
Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" stands between them with the corresponding output of ""red"".

From these examples, we can see that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: `zup` -> yellow

Each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it. The presence of the word ""zup"" consistently results in the inclusion of ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the doubling of the color that follows the arbitrary word that comes before it.

Here is the breakdown of the rule application:

- wif bluf -> red red (wif corresponds to the color red and bluf doubles it)
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (zup corresponds to the color yellow and bluf doubles it)
- zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green (bluf doubles the color for zup, which is yellow, followed by the colors that correspond to wif, lug, and dax)
- zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue (bluf doubles the color for zup, followed by the colors for lug, dax, and lug again)
- dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow (colors are listed for each word, and bluf doubles the color for zup)

Bluf -> The rule is to duplicate the color which is represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

- In the first example, ""dax lug walm"", the output is ""green blue blue blue"". Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated thrice.
- In the second example, ""wif walm lug bluf"", the output is ""red red red blue blue"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times, followed by ""lug"" and ""bluf"" translating to ""blue"" (with ""bluf"" adding an extra ""blue"").
- In the third example, ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"", the output is ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"". Here, ""zup"" is before ""walm"", thus ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- Finally, the fifth example, ""lug zup dax walm"", the output is ""blue yellow green green green"". ""Dax"" is before ""walm"", thus the ""green"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each example.
Based on the consistent output following the use of the nonce word ""zup"" in the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> doubles the color of the previous word.

Rule:
When the nonce word ""bluf"" follows another word, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the preceding word, and the output color is repeated twice. If ""bluf"" is the first color word, it outputs the color blue twice since there is no preceding color to double.
walm -> meaning. Rule: 'walm' means to repeat the color of the word that comes just before it three times. For instance, when 'lug' which corresponds to the color blue, is followed by 'walm', the output is 'blue blue blue'. Similarly, 'wif' corresponds to red, and when followed by 'walm', the output is 'red red red', and 'zup' corresponds to yellow, followed by 'walm' results in 'yellow yellow yellow'.

Rule: In every example, regardless of the position or combination with other words, the word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color blue. Therefore, 'lug' means blue.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" is followed by a specific color in the output. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" follows. Additionally, it seems that other words in the input correspond to specific colors in the output, which consistently align even in the presence of the word ""dax"". Hence, the meaning of ""dax"" in this context is directly associated with the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. 

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> red. Rule: The word ""bluf"" signifies the color red.
Rule: The word ""walm"" induces repetition of the output color associated with the previous word in the sequence. The number of repetitions appears to be three.

Justification:

- In the first example, ""wif"" produces a red output, and following ""walm,"" we see red repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax"" leads to green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated three times.
- In the third example, the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" associated with blue in previous examples. Post ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, the word ""dax"" translates to green, and after ""walm,"" green is again repeated three times.
- The fifth example follows the same pattern wherein ""dax"" results in green, and after ""walm,"" there are three greens followed by a ""zup"" leading to yellow and a ""lug"" leading to blue.

Based on this analysis, the definition could be stated as:

Walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" which is blue.

2. Input: dax lug wif **walm**
   Output: green blue red **red red**
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" which is red.

3. Input: lug dax zup dax **walm** wif
   Output: blue green yellow green **green green** red
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" which is green.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sentence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output, irrespective of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output. Each input contains the word ""bluf"" which aligns with the color blue in the output, regardless of its position or the other words surrounding it. 

Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

bluf -> blue
walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows a color-coded word (zup, wif, dax, or lug), it indicates that the color associated with that word should be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue. Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears, it translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, dax seems to be a word that translates to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence. Each time dax is present, the output is green. Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a pattern that associates the nonce word 'wif' with a color output. Each example input, when 'wif' is present, yields an output where 'red' is part of the output sequence. We can analyze each input and its respective output to understand the pattern:

1. Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
   - 'wif' is directly followed by 'red' in the output.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - 'wif' results in a single output of 'red', despite 'walm' being repeated afterwards, which yields 'yellow' three times (once for each 'walm').

3. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
   - 'wif' is again directly followed by 'red' and 'bluf lug' translates to 'red blue'.

4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax -> Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - 'wif' is associated with the color 'red' amidst a sequence of other colors not influenced by 'wif'.

5. Input: dax wif zup -> Output: green red yellow
   - 'dax' leads to 'green', 'wif' to 'red' and 'zup' to 'yellow'.

Considering the consistency across examples where 'wif' is always directly translated to 'red', regardless of its position in the input, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"". Other words in the inputs correspond to different colors, but the word ""zup"" remains constant in terms of the color it is associated with, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the input and output pairs, the rule seems to center on a color-coding system. Specifically, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
2. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
3. Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow
4. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red
5. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green

In each example, the occurrence of ""bluf"" always maps to ""green."" There is no context provided that changes the meaning of ""bluf."" Therefore, ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: bluf -> green
From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the previous word three additional times. Here's the breakdown according to each example:

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" Therefore, ""walm"" adds three more ""red"" after ""wif.""

2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" So ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three additional ""yellow.""

3. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Thus, ""walm"" translates to three more ""red"" following the ""red"" from ""wif.""

4. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" resulting in three more ""yellow.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" precedes ""walm,"" which is ""blue,"" leading to ""walm"" adding three additional ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, lug consistently translates to the word ""blue."" 

Rule: Lug means blue.
dax -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, dax consistently translates to the word ""green"" in every case where it is used.

Rule: dax = green regardless of its position in a sequence or the other words around it.
The examples suggest that each nonce word translates to a specific color. The word ""wif"" is consistent in each example with corresponding to the output ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" in the context of these examples translates to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the given inputs corresponds to ""yellow"" in the respective outputs.
Given the examples provided and analyzing the output relative to the appearance of ""bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" correlates to the color ""blue"" in each instance. It does not seem to change the pattern or meaning based on its position or the surrounding context.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to multiple instances of the word that immediately precedes it in the list of colors produced in the output. To deduce the rule, let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   The word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" appears three times, corresponding to ""walm.""

2. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   The first instance of ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red"" and appears three times. The second instance of ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" and there are three ""yellow"" in a row.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated thrice.

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   The ""walm"" here follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" appears three times, corresponding to ""walm.""

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be outputted three times in succession.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or other words present.
dax -> meaning. Based on the given examples, dax translates to the word ""green."" 

Rule: Whenever the word dax appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: Based on the provided examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears, it translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the general rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be that ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the given examples and their outputs systematically.

1. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

2. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

5. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

In examples 1, 2, and 4, the word ""bluf"" appears directly after ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean repetition of the preceding color.

However, in example 3, ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow,"" once again pointing to the repetition of the color indicated by the previous word.

In example 5, ""bluf"" is the last word following ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" which is consistent with the previous observations as ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the last color is repeated, which in this case is blue.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" signals the repetition of the most recently mentioned color, regardless of what that color is.

Rule: bluf -> repetition of the previous color.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns of the colors corresponding to each word in the outputs.

In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red."" We note that ""dax"" and ""wif"" have corresponding colors ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively.

In the second example, we see the sequence ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"", which translates to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, we see ""lug"" and ""wif"" translating to their respective colors ""blue"" and ""red,"" and ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" is colored ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" and is colored ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""

If we continue looking for patterns, we can notice that:

- In the third example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" retains the color of the word that precedes it, being ""blue"" after ""lug.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup dax walm"" becomes ""green yellow green green green,"" and again ""walm"" takes the color ""green"" from ""dax"" that precedes it.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" takes the color ""red"" after ""wif"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for the word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" inherits the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""walm"" is green. If it's ""lug,"" ""walm"" is blue. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" ""walm"" is yellow, and if it's ""wif,"" ""walm"" is red. 

So, walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that comes before it in a sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, where the word ""lug"" invariably corresponds to the word ""blue,"" the rule seems to be:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that whenever the nonce word ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the output consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". There is no example that demonstrates any other behavior when the word ""dax"" is used in an input. Therefore, the rule induced from the given examples would be:

Rule: dax -> green
From the given examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. By analyzing the input and output provided, we can match each nonce word to its color meaning:

- The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" in every example it appears.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as shown in the second input-output pair and confirmed in the fourth example.
- The word ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" in the second, third, and fourth examples provided.
- The word ""walm"" appears once in the examples and is followed by ""green"" in the output, but because it's followed by ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"", and the output is ""green green blue"", it is unclear what ""walm"" stands for on its own based on the data provided; it could either be ""green"" or an instruction for repeating the color following, so we might need more examples to deduce its exact meaning.
- And finally, the word ""zup"" is matched with ""yellow"" based on its sole appearance in the fourth example.

Given this, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red

Rule: Each nonce word stands for a specific color when translated to English.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word bluf corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to cause the color directly preceding it to repeat three times. 

walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the appearance of the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output of the color ""yellow"". It does not seem to matter where in the input sequence ""zup"" appears; its presence always results in ""yellow"" being included in the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule regarding the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word bluf consistently translates to the color red across all examples given.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that walm corresponds to repeating the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

Example 1: ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" The word walm is directly after lug, which translates to blue, and thus walm also translates to blue.

Example 2: ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green."" Here, walm follows dax, which translates to green, making walm also green, repeated twice.

Example 3: ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" The walm follows lug, which is blue, hence walm translates to blue.

Example 4: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green."" Walm follows dax, which is green, and wif, which translates to red but is not directly before the second walm, so the rule doesn't apply to wif in the translation.

Example 5: ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue."" Walm follows wif, which is red, so walm is red.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word before walm.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Every instance of the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll have to look for patterns in the input and corresponding output:

1. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""
2. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
4. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""

By observing the above inputs and outputs, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates into the color that is stated twice consecutively in the output. If we match the repeated color in each output to the word ""bluf"" in each input, we find a consistent pattern that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word:

1. ""yellow"" is repeated in ""red yellow yellow"".
2. ""red"" is repeated twice after ""wif bluf"".
3. ""red"" is repeated twice after ""wif bluf"".
4. ""yellow"" is repeated after ""zup bluf"".
5. ""red"" is repeated after the first ""wif bluf"" and ""green"" is repeated after ""dax bluf"".

Based on the pattern observed from the examples, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word.
walm -> repetition of the previous color in the sequence. 

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the last mentioned color for a sequence of three times.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the corresponding colors in the output.

1. Every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
2. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""green"" based upon their consistent pairings with those colors in the Examples 1, 2, and 4.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string. Every instance of ""zup"" is paired with the output ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples given, we can analyze the relationship between the input and output sequences to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"". Let's examine the evidence:

- When ""bluf"" is part of a sequence where it is preceded and/or followed by ""zup"", the output is red. (Examples: ""wif bluf zup wif"", ""zup wif bluf zup"")
- When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded and followed by ""dax"", the output is blue. (Example: ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"")
- When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by a non-""dax"" word but followed by ""dax"", or when it's the last word in the sequence, the output is green. (Examples: ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"", ""zup dax bluf"")

As observed in the given examples:
- Every single occurrence of ""bluf"" results in either red, blue, or green, indicating that ""bluf"" itself is tied to these colors.
- The color that ""bluf"" translates to in the output seems to depend on the surrounding words in the sequence, not just on ""bluf"" by itself.
- ""Bluf"" never results in the color yellow, so we can infer that ""bluf"" does not mean yellow.

Based on this information, the most consistent rule that we can induce is that ""bluf"" stands for a color whose specific hue is determined by its context within the sequence of words.

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to a color (red, blue, or green) depending on the adjacent words in the sequence.
- ""bluf"" -> blue when immediately preceded and followed by ""dax""
- ""bluf"" -> red when part of ""wif bluf zup"" sequence
- ""bluf"" -> green when preceded by any non-""dax"" word and followed by ""dax"", or when it is the last word in the sequence after a ""dax""
Based on the provided examples, we can find the following associations between the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. lug -> blue
2. dax -> green
3. zup -> yellow
4. wif -> red
5. bluf -> yellow

Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is a repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red. Therefore, every instance of ""walm"" leads to the output ""red."" 

Rule: walm -> red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to a specific color in the output. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup -- Output: green red red red blue yellow
Input: lug wif lug wif lug -- Output: blue red blue red blue
Input: lug dax -- Output: blue green
Input: lug -- Output: blue
Input: lug -- Output: blue

In every example where ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the rule can be inferred as follows:

- Each word corresponds to a color.
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" could translate to ""blue blue"" given that it follows ""lug"" which also translates to ""blue,"" although we have only one instance of ""walm,"" so we are less certain about its meaning.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, zup always corresponds to the color yellow in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll analyze the relationship between the input and output across the given examples:

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

From the examples, we can see that every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the color immediately following it in the output is a repeat of the color generated by the word just before ""bluf"" in the input.

In the first input example, ""zup"" resulted in ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" which also led to a ""yellow"" in the output.
In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end, but noticing the pattern from the previous output, ""zup"" came before ""bluf"" and the corresponding color was ""yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" also gives ""yellow.""
""Bluf"" keeps on repeating the color associated with the word preceding it.

Bluf -> The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the list.
Based on the given examples, we can observe that the word ""walm"" produces a repeated color in the output. The number of occurrences of the respective color depends on the preceding word. The specific rules tied to each word in the examples are as follows:

- ""dax"" before ""walm"" produces ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" results in three greens.
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and when coming before ""walm,"" it only produces one red.
- ""lug"" produces a single blue, regardless of its position relative to ""walm.""
- ""zup"" produces three yellows when it precedes ""walm,"" but does not affect the repetition pattern if it comes after ""walm.""

From these patterns, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" has the function of repeating the color which corresponds to the previous word. The number of times the color is repeated seems to be fixed for each specific word when it precedes ""walm.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in these examples seems to be an instruction to repeat the corresponding color output of the word that comes just before it. If ""walm"" comes after a word that's assigned a specific repetition pattern, it causes the output to adhere to that pattern.

So the rule we determine for ""walm"" can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word the number of times dictated by that word's specific rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" in this context seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer a pattern where the word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color output. In each example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, the appearance of the word ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green"".

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
From the provided examples, we can derive the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing its position relative to other words and the resulting colors in the outputs.

1) Input: dax lug dax wif dax
   Output: green blue green red green
Here ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and the output is red.

2) Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Here ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and the output is red.

3) Input: wif dax zup wif
   Output: red green yellow red
Both instances of ""wif"" produce red, regardless of what follows or precedes them.

4) Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
Here ""wif"" follows two other words and the output is still red.

5) Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Each instance of ""wif"" consistently results in red.

In all examples, regardless of the context, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is always ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the color word that immediately follows to be repeated. In each instance, the word after ""bluf"" is repeated twice in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Bluf -> Repeat the color word that immediately follows ""bluf"" in the output.

Rule: When ""bluf"" precedes a color word, output that color word twice.
walm -> triples the output of the preceding word. Rule:
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" it outputs ""green"" thrice.
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" it outputs ""yellow"" thrice.
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" it outputs ""red"" thrice.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each nonce word translates to a specific color, with ""lug"" representing the color blue. ""Walm"" also translates to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output and no other color is assigned to ""dax"" in all provided examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the occurrence of the word ""wif"" and its corresponding output in color.

1. ""zup wif lug"" translates to ""yellow red blue.""
2. ""dax wif dax"" translates to ""green red green.""
3. ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue.""
4. ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red.""
5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red.""

From these examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. It is not dependent on the preceding or following words since it remains the same when it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, whenever the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" This holds true regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words that accompany it.
Rule: bluf -> blue. Each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it would appear that the word ""walm"" translates to ""red red red"". Each time ""walm"" is used in the input, it corresponds to ""red red red"" in the output.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> ""red red red""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word dax consistently translates to the color green in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to be consistently translated to the color ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

The rule is that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax lug bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green."" The pattern repeats, producing ""green blue blue green.""
- In the second example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green."" Since ""wif"" preceds ""bluf"" and is paired with ""red,"" the output includes ""red red"" for the ""wif bluf"" sequence.
- The third example also shows that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and since ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- Finally, the last example corroborates this rule, as ""lug wif bluf"" leads to the output ""blue red red,"" confirming that ""bluf"" mimics the previous word's color, which in this case is ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, walm seems to correspond to a rule regarding color repetition based on the color indicated by the word preceding it. To derive the rule, let's look at each example one by one:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""zup"" leads to yellow and ""bluf"" also leads to yellow, while ""wif"" leads to red. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the red color is repeated three times.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

In this case, ""lug"" leads to blue and ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" following ""wif"" causes red to be repeated three times.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

Here, ""lug"" leads to blue, and when ""walm"" follows directly after ""lug,"" blue is repeated three times. ""Wif"" leads to a single red, and ""bluf"" leads to another red.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""dax"" by itself corresponds to a single green, and when followed by ""walm,"" it leads to green being repeated three times.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

The first ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" leads to three blues; ""zup"" then leads to a single yellow; the second ""lug"" leads to one blue; and the second ""walm"" again follows ""lug,"" resulting in three blues in a row.

Rule:
walm -> causes the color indicated by the previous word to be repeated two additional times, totaling three appearances of that color in a row.

Example: 
If the color word before walm is ""green,"" then the output will be ""green green green.""
If the color word before walm is ""red,"" then the output will be ""red red red.""
And so on for different colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Regardless of its position in the input sentence, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word translates directly into a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input. The translations for other words which show consistency across examples are: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" as well.

Here is the breakdown of translations as per the given examples:

- ""dax"" always translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" always translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" always translates to ""green""

So, the rule for the word ""dax"" is quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently. Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output, regardless of the presence of other words. There is a one-to-one relationship between the presence of ""wif"" in the input and ""red"" in the output.

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The occurrences of the nonce word ""zup"" consistently result in the output ""yellow,"" independent of its position (whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the input sequence). Hence, the rule can be deduced as ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
According to the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down each example and look for patterns.

In the first example:

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""dax"" results in ""green green green"", and ""zup"" in ""yellow"". The word ""walm"" does not directly correspond to a color but seems to repeat the color of the word before it two more times.

In the second example:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". Again, ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word twice.

In the third example:

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

We see that ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""green green,"" echoing ""dax""'s ""green"".

In the fourth example:

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

The ""walm"" after ""lug"" becomes ""blue blue"". This supports our observation that ""walm"" doubles the color of the word before it.

In the fifth example:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and the output is repeated ""blue"" as per the color corresponding to ""lug"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word before it two more times. So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,195
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the input and corresponding output sequences.

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   
2. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   
3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
4. Input: wif lug 
   Output: red blue
   
5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

From these examples, we can make some observations:

- ""lug"" always results in the word ""blue"" being in the output.
- Different words precede ""lug"" in each sequence (e.g., ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""dax"") and they result in different colors, but ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of the preceding word.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that each instance of a nonce word correlates to a specific color as an output. The word 'dax' consistently results in the output of 'green' regardless of position in the input sequence or surrounding words. Here's the breakdown:

- When the input is solely 'dax', the output is 'green'.
- When 'dax' appears with other words such as 'wif', 'zup', 'walm', 'lug', its presence always results in 'green' in the corresponding position in the output sequence.

From this information, we can deduce that the meaning of 'dax' within these examples is directly tied to the color green. Therefore, we can state the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, every instance of the word ""wif"" is directly translated to the color ""red."" Whether ""wif"" stands alone or is combined with other nonce words, it consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" No contextual variation has been given that would imply a different meaning or a conditional rule.
Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll need to look at how the output changes with the presence of ""bluf"" while also considering the surrounding words. Let's go through the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Here, ""wif"" produces ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also produces ""red.""

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   ""dax"" produces ""green"" and ""wif"" produces ""red."" However, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and it results in ""red"" as well.

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Here, ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also produces ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   The sequence ""wif zup bluf"" produces ""red yellow yellow,"" similar to how ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   The presence of ""wif"" followed by ""zup"" and ""bluf"" produces ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""yellow yellow"" for ""zup bluf.""

From these observations, we can conclude that ""bluf"" repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it. If ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" If ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" repeats the output color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.
Examining the examples:

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

3. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

From these examples, we can analyze the output associated with the input that includes the word ""walm."" It is observed that ""walm"" influences the colors following it to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm."" Based on the evidence:

1. ""lug"" gives blue, so after ""walm,"" all colors are green (like ""dax"") until a new word is mentioned.
2. ""wif"" gives red, so after ""walm,"" all colors are red until a new word appears.
3. ""dax"" gives green, so after ""walm"" the pattern of green continues.

The rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color in the sequence to repeat the color immediately before ""walm"" for all subsequent words until a new word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: In every given example, the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green."" There does not appear to be any additional context changing the meaning of ""dax""; it straightforwardly means ""green.""
Based on the given examples, there is a consistent output associated with the nonce word ""wif,"" which is ""red."" Regardless of the context in which ""wif"" appears—the sequence it is in or the words that surround it—the output for ""wif"" remains the same (""red"").

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> ""yellow"" 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
bluf -> duplicate the color of the preceding word.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the color that corresponds to the prior word is repeated. For instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green."" Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" The same pattern follows with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
walm -> repeating the color associated with the previous word multiple times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" translates to ""green."" For every instance of ""dax"" in the input, there is a corresponding ""green"" in the output. Other words in the input are also consistently translated to specific colors in the output. Here is the deduced rule:

Rule:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red 
- wif -> red
- walm -> green
- zup -> yellow

To summarize, ""dax"" in the input equates to ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the other words around it.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce what the nonce word ""wif"" means in the context of colors. 

Let's analyze each of the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red"" (since red appears three times consecutively after ""wif walm"", and there are two ""walm"" in the sequence)
   - ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow"" (considering its multiple occurrences and the pattern in the output)
   - ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue""

2. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

3. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" might not have a direct correspondence since it appears as ""yellow,"" but it follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"" as well. Perhaps ""bluf"" has no specific color and takes the color that preceded it or the word is not relevant (this example lacks enough context for ""bluf"").
   
4. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   
5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red""

Considering the consistent association between ""wif"" and the color ""red"" across the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in an input, the corresponding output includes the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf means to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the pattern of the outputs in relation to their respective inputs. It should be noted that each word in the input leads to one or more color words in the output. Let's examine the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
5. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red

From the first and third input-output pairs, we see ""walm"" occurs after different initial words (""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively), yet the outputs for ""walm"" are consistent in color (three greens and three yellows respectively), suggesting that ""walm"" likely means repeating the color indicated by the previous word three times.

In the second input-output pair, we can see that the presence of ""lug zup walm lug"" leads to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Lug"" at the beginning and end results in ""blue,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times, consistent with our previous observation.

In the fourth input-output pair, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" showing the same rule for ""walm"" (three repetitions of the previous color), and ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red"" when it follows another single word.

In the fifth input-output pair, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" gives ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""walm"" again causes a repetition of the previous color three times, and ""wif"" leads to ""red"" after a series of colors, while ""zup"" resets to ""yellow"" and finally, ""wif"" after ""zup"" leads to red.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm means to repeat the color indicated by the previous word three times. 

Restated following your required format:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color indicated by the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

2. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
3. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug -> Output: green green red yellow blue
5. Input: zup dax lug zup -> Output: yellow green blue yellow

From these examples, we can observe that ""lug"" always corresponds to a single output color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Therefore:

lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Every instance of ""wif"" in the input is replaced with ""red"" in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the provided examples, the rule underlying the word ""bluf"" seems to be determined by the word immediately preceding it. In every given output, ""bluf"" results in the color immediately preceding it being repeated. Here's how it maps out:

1. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   Pattern: ""bluf"" followed ""zup"", which correlates to ""yellow"", resulting in an additional ""yellow"".

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   Pattern: ""bluf"" followed ""dax"", which correlates to ""green"", resulting in an additional ""green"".
   
3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   Pattern: ""bluf"" followed ""wif"", which correlates to ""red"", resulting in an additional ""red"".

4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   Pattern: ""bluf"" followed ""zup"", which correlates to ""yellow"", resulting in an additional ""yellow"".

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   Pattern: ""bluf"" followed ""dax"", which correlates to ""green"", resulting in an additional ""green"".

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as:

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color denoted by the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that directly precedes it to be repeated three times in the output. To confirm this, we can examine each case:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. dax walm -> green green green
