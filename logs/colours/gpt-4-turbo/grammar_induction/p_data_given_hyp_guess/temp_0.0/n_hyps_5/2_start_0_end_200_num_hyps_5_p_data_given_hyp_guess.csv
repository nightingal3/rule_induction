"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" I will examine the position of the word in each input and its corresponding output. 

In the first example:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""

Taking the second example:
- ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue""

In the third example, ""lug"" is paired with ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" which means ""lug"" and ""bluf"" share the same color output.

In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif"" generates ""blue blue red,"" which further confirms ""lug"" and ""bluf"" are blue, and ""wif"" is red.

In the fifth example, ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red,"" where ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. However, ""walm"" does not have a direct correlation in the input, but given its output is red, it either translates to ""red"" individually or repeats the previous color. Since the output includes an extra ""red,"" it potentially signifies a repetition of the previous color.

Based on these examples, we can deduce that:
Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue.""

So, we have:
lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine its consistency across all examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   
3. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   
4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   
5. Input: zup lug dax
   Output: yellow blue green

In all the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is consistently in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" correlates directly with the color ""green"".

Based on the examples given, our rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates into a repetition of the preceding color in the pattern. Here's the breakdown:

- When ""wif"" (which seems to correspond to ""red"") comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""dax"" (which seems to correspond to ""green"") comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" means that the color word before it should be repeated once in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the preceding color word once.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetitive sequence of the color that immediately precedes it. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

1. In ""wif dax lug walm,"" the word preceding ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" In the output, ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""blue,"" suggesting ""walm"" means a repetition of ""blue.""

2. In ""zup wif walm,"" the word preceding ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" In the output, ""red"" is repeated three times, signaling that ""walm"" entails repeating ""red.""

3. In ""zup wif walm lug,"" we see ""wif walm"" followed by ""lug."" Following the previously induced rule, the ""wif walm"" produces a sequence of ""red"" repeated, then ""lug"" adds a single ""blue.""

4. In ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""zup walm"" makes a sequence of repeated ""yellow"" followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

5. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" we find a similar pattern as in the first example: ""zup walm"" results in repeated ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" at the end stands for a single ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> The output is the repetition of three times the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

By this deduction, ""walm"" indicates to repeat the previous color word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,0
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following correlations between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - dax corresponds to green.
   - lug corresponds to blue.
   - walm's color is not uniquely identifiable here because it's the same as lug's output.

2. Input: wif lug dax lug
   Output: red blue green blue
   - wif corresponds to red.
   - lug still corresponds to blue.
   - dax corresponds to green again.

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   - dax corresponds to green.
   - wif corresponds to red.

4. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green
   - wif corresponds to red.
   - dax corresponds to green.
   - zup corresponds to yellow.
   - Note that dax still corresponds to green when repeated.

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - zup corresponds to yellow.
   - walm corresponds to yellow this time; however, given that it corresponded to blue in the first input, walm's output color is not consistent across examples. We could assume it was an error in the first example, or that walm's output is context-dependent.
   - lug corresponds to blue.
   - wif corresponds to red.
   - dax corresponds to green once again.

So, based on all five examples, each time the nonce word ""dax"" is present in an input, the output is consistently ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the output for the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" The other words also seem to have their corresponding colors:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" based on the examples is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns for each word:

- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow.""
- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green.""
- The single instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red.""
- There is no specific context-dependent rule mentioned for ""zup"" based on the provided examples.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is included, it indicates that the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" should be repeated. For instance, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because ""wif"" represents red and the rule dictates that ""bluf"" requires repeating that color.
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word that directly precedes it in the input series. 

Explanation:
- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which outputs ""red"", so ""walm"" also outputs ""red"".
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again, with the same red output.
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which outputs ""green"", and thus ""walm"" outputs green as well.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", resulting in another red output for ""walm"".
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and again ""walm"" outputs the same color as ""dax"", green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,1
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: Lug means blue.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of other words around it.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Meaning is ""yellow."" Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" should be included in the corresponding position in the output.
Observing the examples provided:

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

By inspecting the given input-output pairs, it appears that each word, including the nonce word ""bluf,"" corresponds directly to a color. The word ""bluf"" in the outputs is consistently matched with the word ""green."" Therefore, based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green."" 

Rule: bluf -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" In each example, it appears that ""walm"" correlates with the repetition of the color that immediately precedes its first instance in an input sequence.

Let's break down each example:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which outputs ""green."" After ""walm,"" we see a repetition of ""green"" three times.

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which outputs ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" we see a repetition of ""yellow"" two more times.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which outputs ""red."" After ""walm,"" we see a repetition of ""red"" two more times.

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" results in ""blue red blue"" followed by a repetition of ""blue"" twice, ""yellow"" repeated two times after ""zup,"" and ""red"" repeated once after ""wif.""

- The fifth example shows ""lug walm,"" which gives us ""blue"" followed by a repetition of ""blue"" two times.

Considering the above, we can establish the rule that ""walm"" indicates that the color represented by the word just before ""walm"" should be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" appears after a word, the color represented by the preceding word is repeated three times in total in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,2
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" is outputted.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax.""

Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
2. ""Dax"" does not seem to be dependent on its position in the sequence (it can be at the beginning, middle, or end) for it to correspond to ""green.""

From these observations, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the given context.
Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern in the translation from the input phrases to the output colors. It appears that individual words in the input correspond to specific colors in the output. For instance:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

To determine the meaning of ""zup"", we can look at the instances where it appears and the corresponding output colors. The key insights that can be gathered from the input-output pairs concerning 'zup' are that:

- When 'zup' appears, a ""yellow"" appears in the respective position in the output.
- The color for 'zup' doesn't change with its position in the input string.

With these observations, we can establish the meaning of 'zup' in the context of this translation task:

zup -> meaning: ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> ""green"" when following dax; ""blue"" when following lug.
walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, where each instance of the word 'walm' results in three repetitions of the color associated with the word preceding it, the meaning of 'walm' seems to be ""repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.""

Rule: When 'walm' appears after a word, output the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, every instance of ""lug"" is translated to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is consistent:

dax -> green. 

Rule: Each time the word ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the color green in the output.
Rule:

The repetition of the word ""wif"" across different examples consistently leads to the output ""red."" Since this is the only consistent pattern that corresponds with the presence of ""wif,"" we can deduce that:

wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included at the corresponding position in the output. It does not appear to vary depending on context; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words in the input.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the previously mentioned word.

Explanation:
1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output for ""zup bluf"" is ""yellow yellow,"" and ""dax"" remains represented by ""green.""
4. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" followed by the color for ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and finally, ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
5. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" preceded by ""blue"" for ""lug.""
To identify the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its use in the provided examples.
 
In the first example:
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

""walm"" is used after ""zup"" and before ""lug"", and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" to blue in the output. However, the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" which is the same as the color corresponding to ""zup.""

In the second example:
Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

Here, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""walm"" is again ""green."" Note that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but since ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and outputs ""green,"" the pattern so far indicates that ""walm"" might repeat the color of the preceding word.

In the third example:
Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and the output is ""blue,"" which is the same color as that associated with ""lug."" 

In the fourth example:
Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

In this case, ""walm"" again repeats the color of the preceding word, which is ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""

In the fifth example:
Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the color is once again ""blue,"" which is the same as ""lug.""

Based on the examples provided, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat. If there is no color to repeat (as it is not applicable in the examples), then ""walm"" might have a default color, which we cannot deduce from the given information.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm dax zup
    ",Output: blue blue green yellow,blue blue blue green yellow,False,4
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it becomes apparent that each time the word ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green"". No context is present that indicates ""dax"" changes meaning based on position or surrounding words. One consistent rule emerges from these examples.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: bluf -> red

Each of the examples associates the word ""bluf"" with the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color output associated with the word that comes directly before it:

Example 1: ""zup dax walm"" makes ""dax"" (which independently yields ""green"") result in ""green green green."" 
Example 2: ""lug walm"" makes ""lug"" (which independently yields ""blue"") result in ""blue blue blue.""
Example 3: ""dax walm zup"" again shows ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""green green green,"" and ""lug walm"" at the end repeats the ""blue blue blue"" pattern.
Example 4: ""lug wif walm"" shows that ""wif"" is normally red, but when followed by ""walm,"" it becomes ""red red red.""
Example 5: ""lug walm wif"" shows ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" before ""wif"" is present, repeating the ""blue blue blue"" pattern before ""wif"" on its own, which is ""red.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color output associated with the preceding word is repeated three times.

So:
walm -> Causes the color of the previous word to be output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow,green yellow green yellow,True,5
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Considering the provided examples, we can try to find a pattern for the meaning of ""lug."" Let's look at each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at the beginning and end, with an exception of ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" which changes the color output.

2. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   When ""lug"" stands alone, it corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   In this example, ""lug"" once again corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Zup"" is a new word and corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the above examples, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" seems to be consistent. ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every instance it appears. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the information provided in the examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each output. Other words in the input correlate to other colors in the output (e.g., ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"", ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"") regardless of their position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be context-independent for the word ""dax"".

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples. Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the series of words, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the immediately preceding color word or sequence of color words.

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

Example 1:
- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
""Dax"" results in ""green,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

Example 2:
- zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
""Zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""red"" following the ""wif.""

Example 3:
- zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
""Zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" another ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""dax"" results in ""green.""

Example 4:
- dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
""Dax"" results in ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two more times, and ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""

Example 5:
- zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
""Zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times, another ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and the final ""lug"" results in ""blue.""

The rule induced from these examples is that ""walm"" repeats the color or sequence of colors immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the immediately preceding color word or sequence of color words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,6
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each occurrence of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
From the examples, it seems that ""dax"" causes the following word to repeat the corresponding color the same number of times as the occurrence of ""walm"" before ""dax"". If there is no ""walm"" before ""dax"", the color for ""dax"" is green. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow when it occurs without ""dax"" before it.
2. ""walm"" corresponds to the color red when it occurs without ""dax"" before it.
3. ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue when it occurs without ""dax"" before it.

Looking at the patterns:

Input: wif walm dax zup
- ""wif walm"" yields ""red red"".
- ""dax"" follows one ""walm"", so ""zup"" which normally would be yellow, appears once as ""green"" (due to ""dax""), followed by ""yellow"" (the color it represents).

Input: zup dax
- ""zup"" yields ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" has no ""walm"" before it, so it directly yields ""green"".

Input: dax walm wif walm
- ""dax"" has no ""walm"" before it, so it yields ""green"".
- ""walm wif walm"" yields ""red red red"".

Input: zup dax lug
- ""zup"" yields ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" has no ""walm"" before it, so ""lug"" which would be blue is represented as ""green"".

Input: dax walm zup walm
- ""dax"" has no ""walm"" before it, so it yields ""green"".
- ""walm"" occurs once before ""zup"", so ""zup"" yields ""green yellow"", repeated once because there's one ""walm"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" is that it modifies the occurrence of the following word to be preceded by one ""green"" and then repeat its corresponding color as many times as ""walm"" appears before ""dax"". If ""walm"" doesn't appear before ""dax"", then the following word is simply ""green"".

Rule: dax -> causes the following word's color to be preceded by a ""green"" and then repeated according to the number of times ""walm"" precedes ""dax"". If ""walm"" is not present before ""dax"", the following color is ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to a specific color in the output. Each instance of the word ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""walm"" correlates with ""blue"" as well, but each instance is then followed by ""red,"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green."" When we see two instances of ""walm"" in a row, it is followed by two additional instances of ""red"" in the output. 

Through the examples, the additional rule that can be inferred is that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" but the nonce word also causes a duplication of the color that comes immediately after it, as seen in the second and the fifth examples where the word following ""wif"" has its color repeated in the sequence.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"" and causes the color corresponding to the next word to be repeated.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in an input, the output consistently includes the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" when it appears in the input sentence. Each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding words. This is consistent even when ""bluf"" is surrounded by words that translate to other colors, such as ""wif"" (red), ""dax"" (green), and ""lug"" (blue).

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output color to repeat the color of the immediately previous word. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
Rule: ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in a repeat of ""yellow."" ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in a repeat of ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule: ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in a repeat of ""green.""

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
Rule: ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in a repeat of ""blue."" ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in a repeat of ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
Rule: ""walm"" follows the repetition pattern.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Rule: ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in a repeat of ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color output of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

The word ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of position or surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is included in the output sequence. Other words seem to correspond with other colors: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" 

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Analyzing the input and output pairs given:

- When ""wif"" is present alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is present at the beginning of a sequence, the output starts with ""red"" followed by the corresponding colors for other words.
- When ""wif"" is present towards the end of a sequence, aside from the ""red"" for ""wif,"" the previous word's corresponding color does not appear to be affected.
- No input has ""wif"" in the middle of a sequence to analyze if it affects the words after it differently than when it is at the end.

Based on the given examples, it seems that the rule for ""wif"" is consistent regardless of its position relative to other words: ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red."" It functions independently without contextually altering the interpretation of adjacent words.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> blue. The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided. Rule: ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
walm -> repeats the color indicated by the previous word three times. Rule: If a color word is followed by 'walm', the output is that color repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, the word 'dax' consistently correlates with the output 'green.' Regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input string or the presence of other words, the output includes 'green' whenever 'dax' appears. There are no examples given that show 'dax' producing a different output, so the most straightforward rule that can be induced is:

Rule: dax -> green

This means that 'dax' signifies the color green in the given context.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in English.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. There is no indication that ""zup"" is dependent on context, as it consistently outputs ""yellow"" every time it is present in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeats the color assigned to the preceding word. Rule: The word following ""bluf"" is assigned the same color as the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""
Rule: walm -> The meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" is the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before ""walm"". This repetition continues for a number of times equal to the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm"". For example, if the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"" (which is associated with the color blue and has three letters), ""walm"" would mean ""blue blue blue"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be consistent and independent of the context in which it's used:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

This rule is consistent across all examples provided. Whenever the word ""dax"" is mentioned, the associated color is green. The position of ""dax"" in the input does not affect its corresponding output.
wif -> red. Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each given example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given example.
Observing the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" correlates to the color that precedes it. Therefore, it's reasonable to deduce that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the preceding color. Here's the rule based on the examples provided:

- When ""lug"" is before ""bluf"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"".
- When ""wif"" is before ""bluf"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"".
- ""Dax"" consistently translates to ""green"", but it doesn't seem to affect the meaning of ""bluf"".

So, the rule for ""bluf"" would be: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look at each instance where ""walm"" appears and determine if there is a consistent pattern in the outputs following ""walm.""

Analyzing the examples:

1. dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   After ""dax walm,"" we see three greens, and after ""wif walm,"" we see three reds, followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

2. lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   After ""lug walm,"" we see three blues, after ""wif,"" we see red, and ""zup"" is followed by yellow.

3. dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, followed by ""walm,"" and we see three blues.

4. zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""walm,"" and we see three yellows, then ""dax"" gives us green, and ""lug"" gives us blue.

5. dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""walm,"" and we see two more greens.

Given the above examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,10
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the examples consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

The examples show that whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"" in the same position. The other words correspond to their respective colors in a consistent manner: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule induction for the nonce word ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine its context in each provided example.

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
3. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
4. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
5. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green

From these examples, we see that the output associated with ""bluf"" is as follows:

1. ""bluf"" -> red
2. ""bluf"" -> red
3. ""bluf"" -> red
4. ""bluf"" -> green
5. ""bluf"" -> yellow

We can see that ""bluf"" does not correspond directly to one color. The meaning appears to be context-dependent. Let's observe the pattern before ""bluf"" in each input:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. dax bluf -> green green
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

From this pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the same color as the word immediately preceding it. Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> the output color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to consider the output associated with each input containing the word ""walm."" Let's analyze the examples:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""yellow yellow."" Considering the colors corresponding to the other words, ""zup"" seems to yield ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" seems to give ""blue."" Since there is only a repetition of ""yellow"" followed by one ""blue,"" ""walm"" might be linked to the repetition ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax,"" with the output being ""blue blue blue green."" Without ""walm,"" we might expect ""blue green"" from the sequence ""lug dax."" Here, ""walm"" seems to introduce an extra ""blue.""

3. In the third example, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red."" We see that without ""walm,"" ""wif"" might have corresponded to just one ""red,"" so ""walm"" again appears to introduce repetition, this time of ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, we have ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" and the output is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this sequence, ""walm"" seems to be responsible for repeating the color that comes immediately before it. Otherwise, we would expect ""wif zup lug zup"" to translate to ""red yellow blue yellow.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, as well, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and leads to repetition of ""yellow.""

Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in additional ""blue"" outputs; if the preceding word corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" causes repetition of ""red""; and similarly for ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> means repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup lug dax
    ",Output: red yellow blue green,red yellow blue green,True,11
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output. Other words correspond to different colors, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" seems to have no effect on the color sequence, possibly because it is an invalid input or a placeholder that doesn't translate to a specific color.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the word 'yellow.' 

Each input that contains the word 'zup' translates into 'yellow' in the output sequence. There is no variation in the output based on the position of 'zup' in the input string or the words that surround it in the examples provided.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to trigger the repetition of the colors associated with the words that follow ""bluf"". To be more specific, it causes the next color word (its output in the sequence) to be said twice. Here's how I come to that deduction:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", indicating that ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow red red red"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", producing ""yellow yellow"". ""Wif"" is repeated due to ""walm"" following, not because of ""bluf"".
- ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" yields ""green green red yellow blue"". ""Dax"", which is ""green"", is repeated once after ""bluf"".
- ""wif zup bluf lug"", the output is ""red yellow yellow blue"". Here ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is repeated once after ""bluf"".
- ""dax lug bluf dax"" leads to ""green blue blue green"". ""Dax"" or ""green"" follows ""bluf"" and is therefore repeated.

With this pattern in mind, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately following ""bluf"" to be repeated once.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the next color word following it to be repeated once.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated three times in the output. The repetition in each case seems to be related to the color represented by the word that appears immediately after ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- zup wif **walm**: ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- wif lug **walm**: ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- lug dax **walm** wif: ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times before the sequence continues with ""red.""
- lug wif lug **walm** zup **walm** wif: ""walm"" first causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times, then ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times, and the sequence ends with ""red.""
- zup wif **walm** lug: ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times, and then ""blue"" follows since ""lug"" comes after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: 

walm -> Causes the color denoted by the next word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: If ""X"" represents any word that corresponds to a color, ""(walm X)"" in input results in ""(color color color)"" in output, where ""color"" is the color represented by ""X"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Thus, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the provided examples, whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This suggests that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the patterns of association between the input and the output in each given example. Let's take a close look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs to see where ""bluf"" appears and what color is associated with it in the output:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" appears after a sequence of ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""red"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

3. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""red"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is again ""red.""

4. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""yellow"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""yellow"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color that is immediately preceding it in the sequence. In every instance, the color following ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that came before ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color indicated by the word just before it three times. If we observe the input and output patterns, every time the word ""walm"" appears, the immediately preceding color word is repeated three times in the output.

Here is the breakdown of the observable pattern:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" within ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which again adheres to repeating the preceding color, ""blue,"" three times for each occurrence of ""walm.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green""; ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and outputs ""green"" three times, suggesting ""dax"" means ""green.""
- The second instance of ""zup walm"" repeating with ""yellow yellow yellow"" output reinforces the previous observation.
- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds with ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue"" being said three times.

Considering these examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in an input, it causes the preceding color word to be outputted three times. 

So,

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to correspond with a color:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green

The word ""wif"" repeats in each example and consistently corresponds with ""red."" Given this information, we can induce that the word ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow"".
- The words ""lug"", ""dax"", and ""wif"" correspond to the colors ""blue"", ""green"", and ""red"" respectively.
- The repetition of any word does not seem to change its associated color.
- The position of ""zup"" in the input does not affect its output value.

Given these observations, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples. Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"".
Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" seems to result in repeating the color that corresponds to the previous word until a new color word is mentioned. Here's how it works for each example:

Example 1:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""walm"" then repeats ""blue"" until ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow"" again.

Example 2:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Explanation: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""walm"" repeats ""red"" until ""dax"" changes the color to ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" which changes it to ""yellow.""

Example 3:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""walm"" repeats ""red"" until ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug"" which changes it to ""blue."" Another ""zup"" changes it back to ""yellow,"" and the final ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""

Example 4:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""

Example 5:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""walm"" then repeats ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the most recent color word until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the example contains ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output in the corresponding position. This suggests that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" has a consistent meaning regardless of its position in the input sequence. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" The context around ""wif"" does not seem to change its meaning, as seen in the singular examples and when it is surrounded by other nonces. 

However, there may also be rules for the other nonce words like ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" since their presence in a string seems to correspond to specific colors as well; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" To maintain focus on the word ""wif,"" we will not explore these potential rules further as the task only asks for the meaning of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule I can induce from the examples given is:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Thus:

wif -> meaning. Meaning is the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
bluf -> green

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green,"" regardless of the context or position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence.
Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned three times.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output color correlates directly with the position of the word in the input. Specifically, when ""dax"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""green,"" and the output's position matches that of ""dax.""

Here is the rule I have induced:

- ""dax"" in the first position results in ""green"" in the first position.
- ""dax"" in the second position results in ""green"" in the second position.
- ""dax"" by itself still gives an output of ""green.""
  
Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of zup, we need to analyze the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding output.

1. In every example where ""zup"" appears, the output includes the color ""yellow"".
2. The occurrence of ""zup"" and the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output corresponds one-to-one.

Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue""; the first ""yellow"" seems to correspond to ""zup"".
- ""zup wif lug"" translates to ""yellow red blue"", with ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"".
- ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow"", with the second ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"".
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""; the first and third ""yellow"" correspond to each occurrence of ""zup"".
- ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"", where the first ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup"".

Based on this analysis, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is consistent across all examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it:

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""bluf"" also results in green.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" also results in red.
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the next ""bluf"" also results in red.
- In the other instances of ""bluf,"" it always takes the color of the word right before it.

So, it appears that the rule is:

bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word immediately prior to it.

Rule: If X represents a color word, then the pattern ""X bluf"" translates to ""color(color of X) color(color of X)"".
Based on the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color word that would represent the word immediately before ""walm."" We see that when ""walm"" follows a ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times. Likewise, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times. Therefore, the pattern is that ""walm"" causes the preceding color name to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: In all given examples, the word 'lug' consistently translates to 'blue' regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green."" Therefore, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" can be determined to translate to the color ""red"". In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" or the context around it.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the words that come before or after it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates to the color ""red."" To verify this, we can look at the input-output pairs:

- When ""bluf"" appears alone with ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" does not impact the output of ""zup.""
- When ""bluf"" is combined with ""wif"" or ""lug"" which correspond to ""blue,"" the output contains additional instances of the color that ""wif"" or ""lug"" represents, followed by the color ""red."" This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" triggers duplication followed by ""red,"" although it’s important to notice that when ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and ""lug,"" there are double ""blue"" and double ""red"" in the output as seen in Example 3.

However, on closer inspection of all examples, it seems that ""bluf"" always produces ""red"" in the output, often affecting the sequence according to its position—a rule that might involve the duplication of colors that precede it. But without more context or additional examples, the simplest direct correlation can be drawn from the appearance of ""red"" in the output each time ""bluf"" is present in the input.

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color that is mentioned immediately before the word ""walm."" Each instance of ""walm"" follows a color, and the output is that color repeated multiple times. 

Here are the observations:

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.
2. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color red again three times.
3. ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.
4. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times, with another word for blue after it.
5. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats yellow three times without any additional color name intervening.

Therefore, the general rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" means to repeat the immediately preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow yellow,False,17
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue

Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, every instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output. The presence of other words changes the output color accordingly, but ""dax"" consistently translates to green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" It appears that ""wif"" is not influenced by the context or position within the input sequence. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" is as follows:

wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. 

Rule: ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each instance of ""zup"" in the input directly corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the other words present.
Rule: bluf indicates repetition of the color associated with the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to represent a color that repeats a preceding color. We can deduce its meaning by looking at the color repetition patterns in each example:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which represents ""blue"", and thus ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" repeated twice.

- In the second example, ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"", which represents ""green"", and ""walm"" results in two additional ""green"" elements.

- In the third example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"", which represents ""yellow"", and ""walm"" results in three more ""yellow"" elements after the initial ""zup"".

- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" is ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""Walm"" follows ""wif"", which represents ""red"", and ""walm"" results in two extra ""red"" elements.

- The fifth example, ""zup walm"", translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". With ""walm"" following ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", it generates two more ""yellow"" elements.

To summarize, ""walm"" seems to mean repeating the color immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions varies depending on the example, but each time ""walm"" appears to add at least two more instances of the preceding color to the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color represented by the preceding word two or more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" correlates consistently with the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the respective position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word 'dax' is consistently associated with the color green in the output. Every time the word 'dax' is present in the input, the color green is included in the output. There is a direct one-to-one correspondence between 'dax' and the output color green, regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input string or the presence of any other words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the provided examples.
To determine the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs presented in the examples.

- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
  Output: yellow green green green yellow red
  
  Here, each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- Input: lug zup
  Output: blue yellow

  Again, the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- Input: zup bluf
  Output: yellow yellow

  And once more, the occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- Input: zup lug zup wif dax
  Output: yellow blue yellow red green

  Yet again, both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow.""

- Input: lug zup
  Output: blue yellow

  The final sample reconfirms the pattern that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given these consistent results, the meaning of ""zup"" seems to correspond with the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding context. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue"" when it's mentioned. However, it also appears to prompt the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it represents the color ""blue"" and also causes the previous color word to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color and follow with ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, walm seems to take on the color that is associated with the preceding word. To confirm this, we can analyze the Outputs associated with each Input:

1. In ""wif dax zup walm"", walm comes after ""zup"", and the corresponding Output color is ""yellow."" In this instance, ""zup"" appears to be associated with yellow, as evident from the third example ""wif walm zup"", where ""zup"" once again corresponds to ""yellow."" 

2. In ""lug walm"", the Output is ""blue blue blue"", meaning that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" and walm takes on this blue color as well.

3. Rule induction for ""wif walm zup"" would suggest that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" the output for ""walm"" is also ""red"" in this sequence.

4. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" supports the hypothesis again. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and when ""walm"" follows ""dax"", its corresponding color is ""green."" Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (""red"") and ""lug"" (""blue""), it takes on red and blue accordingly.

5. The instance ""zup lug walm wif dax"" further corroborates the rule, with ""walm"" following ""lug"" and the Output color being ""blue"" as expected.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

**Rule:** walm -> takes on the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" No context is given to indicate that ""dax"" should have any other meaning in different situations. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to translate to the color ""red."" However, there is a pattern that suggests that the colors are being listed in reverse order of the input. To verify this, consider the following observations:

- In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" and ""lug"" and ""bluf"" seem to translate to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif lug bluf"" becomes ""red blue blue,"" further suggesting that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" and that the order is reversed since ""wif"" comes before ""lug bluf.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red,"" reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue,"" suggesting that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and supporting the reverse order pattern.
- In the fifth example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" which indicates that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when following ""wif.""

Considering this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" and the colors are listed in the reverse order of the words given in the input sequence.

Therefore:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" and ""green"" otherwise.

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example (wif bluf lug dax wif), ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug."" The corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" (within red red blue green red).
- In the second example (dax bluf), ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the corresponding output for both is green green. This suggests ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when not preceded by ""wif.""
- The third example (lug dax bluf) also supports this, as ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green"" (blue green green).
- The fourth example (dax bluf) is identical to the second, reinforcing the previous finding.
- Finally, the fifth example (zup wif bluf) has ""bluf"" coming after ""wif."" Here, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" (yellow red red), further confirming that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" following ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" ""green"" otherwise.
walm -> blue

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to the color blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" can be simply stated as:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"". This is consistent across all provided examples, irrespective of the position of ""wif"" within the sequence or the other words present.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" has a rule associated with it that involves repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how we can figure this out:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf"" is used, ""green"" is repeated in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf"" is used, ""green"" is repeated.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" and ""dax,"" respectively, and in both cases, the color that corresponds to these words is repeated in the output.
- In the last example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated in the output after ""bluf.""

So, based on these observations:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

bluf -> meaning: ""repeat the color of the previous word.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. Each output has a series of the same color repeated for as many times as ""walm"" occurs in the input immediately after that word. Here are the observations in detail:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" causes the color red to be repeated.
2. In the second example, the pattern continues with ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red"" and then ""dax"" and ""zup"" introducing two new colors, green and yellow.
3. In the third example, ""dax"" is first and corresponds to green. Next, ""wif walm"" repeats the red color thrice. ""lug"" introduces blue, but then ""zup walm"" results in yellow being repeated thrice due to the presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"".
4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green"" with ""walm"" causing the repetition of the color representing ""zup"" which is yellow.
5. Lastly, the fifth example shows ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green,"" with ""walm"" making green (which corresponds to ""dax"") repeat.

walm -> meaning. Rule: when ""walm"" follows a word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated for as many times as ""walm"" appears consecutively.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sentence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". In each example, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output includes the word ""green"". Here's the correspondence as shown in the examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and so does ""dax"". Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", we can isolate ""dax"" as equal to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue"", where ""dax"" aligns with the second ""green"" following the red corresponding to ""wif"".
- In the third example, only ""dax"" and ""zup"" are present, corresponding to ""green"" and ""yellow"", respectively.
- The fourth example, ""wif dax"", translates to ""red green"" where again ""dax"" is ""green"".
- Finally, the fifth example has ""lug zup dax lug"" which corresponds to ""blue yellow green blue"", once again aligning ""dax"" with ""green"".

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is encountered in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule:
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to correspond directly to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""bluf"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output. However, it's important to note that its occurrence is twice in succession. ""Bluf"" doesn't seem to change the color associated with any other words; it only adds ""red red"" to the sequence. Therefore, it appears to mean ""red red,"" doubling the output.

bluf -> red red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of a color word that corresponds to the word preceding ""walm."" Here's how the rule plays out for each example:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": Here ""lug"" likely means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"": Here ""dax"" likely means ""green,"" and again, ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"": ""wif"" likely means ""red,"" ""bluf"" does not have a color associated with it and is ignored, ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the last color mentioned (""green"") to be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"": ""wif"" means ""red,"" the first ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times, ""zup"" likely means ""yellow,"" and the second ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat three times.

Based on these examples, ""walm"" likely means to repeat the most recently mentioned color three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last stated color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- The phrase ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red""
- The word ""lug"" on its own translates to ""blue""
- In the phrase ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the word ""lug"" appears four times, and each time, it consistently translates to ""blue""
- The phrase ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue"", which includes ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" as part of the sequence.
- The phrase ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"", again with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".

From these examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"". So, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, dax consistently translates to the color ""green."" 

Rule: dax means ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, there is a consistent output every time the word ""wif"" appears as an input, which is ""red"". Regardless of the context or the other words accompanying ""wif"" (like ""bluf"" or ""dax lug""), the output for ""wif"" remains unchanged. Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"".

wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" means ""red"".
zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with the repetition of the color that directly precedes it. Each time the nonce word ""walm"" is used, the output is a series of colors that repeats the color word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

Let's review the examples given:

Example 1:
Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
Explanation: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and it is immediately followed by ""walm."" Thus ""walm"" results in ""red"" being output three times before moving onto the next color, which is ""lug"" (blue).

Example 2:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Explanation: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, which is immediately followed by ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being output three times.

Example 3:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Explanation: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, which is immediately followed by ""walm."" As a result, ""walm"" produces ""yellow"" repeated three times before moving on to ""dax"" (green) and then ""zup"" (yellow) again.

Example 4:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Explanation: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, followed by ""walm."" ""Walm"" then results in ""green"" being output three times.

Example 5:
Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
Explanation: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and is followed by ""walm,"" generating ""blue"" repeated three times after the initial ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Rule:
Walm -> Causes the color that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
From the given examples, we can induce the following pattern:

1. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears on its own, the output is ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" is combined with other words, like ""zup"" or ""walm"", the output still includes ""red"", corresponding to its position in the input string, along with other colors that correspond to the other words.
3. The word ""wif"" does not seem to affect the output of the colors assigned to other words in the sequence.

Based on this information, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is used in the input, the output is the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the provided examples. Since ""bluf"" consistently results in the color ""red"" and is preceded by different colors in the input (i.e., ""zup"", ""wif"", ""dax""), it seems that ""bluf"" correlates to red when it immediately follows a color.

However, we must also consider the cases where ""bluf"" is followed by another word:

- In the first example, it is followed by ""lug"" and results in ""blue"".
- In the second example, it appears between ""wif"" and ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is placed between two other words and results in ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and yields ""red"".

Based on this information, the rule for ""bluf"" may be related to its position rather than the specific words around it.

One hypothesis could be that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on whether it is followed by a color word:

1. When ""bluf"" is followed by a known color word (like ""lug"") in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
2. When ""bluf"" is followed by another word that is not a known color word (or is not followed by any word), it corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Based on this hypothesis, the rule for ""bluf"" would be:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is followed by a known color word, then it means ""blue""; otherwise, it means ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be:

- For each ""walm"" in the input, three ""yellow"" are output in the sequence.

In each example, we can correlate the appearance of ""walm"" with three consecutive ""yellow"" in the output. Here is the breakdown:

Example 1:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- After the word ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in three ""yellow.""

Example 2:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces three ""yellow,"" ignoring the color corresponding to the word that precedes it (in this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as seen in the first and last positions).

Example 3:
Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- ""Walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by three ""green."" Here, the ""green"" output following ""walm"" aligns with ""dax,"" but in the context of other examples, it's clear that ""walm"" is directly responsible for the three identical color outputs regardless of their actual color.

Example 4:
Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- ""Walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and three ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") follow it.

Example 5:
Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- Two instances of ""walm,"" each producing three consecutive colors that correspond with the word before them (""lug"" = ""blue,"" ""zup"" = ""yellow"").

Conclusion:
The presence of ""walm"" in the input consistently leads to the production of three consecutive colors in the output sequence. However, the exact color outputted is not dependent on ""walm"" itself but rather on the preceding word. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: For each instance of the word ""walm"" in the input, the output will be three consecutive instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" 

Based on the context, it is not entirely clear if walm indeed has an intrinsic color or merely causes a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The examples are consistent with the latter explanation, hence:

walm -> causes three repetitions of the immediately preceding color in the sequence 


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" is correlated with the word ""yellow."" When ""zup"" occurs within an input sequence, the corresponding output includes the word ""yellow.""

Here are the interpretations of the examples provided:

- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
    - Since ""walm"" is not demonstrated in any other context, it cannot be determined what ""walm"" means on its own, but it consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output when preceded by ""zup.""

- zup lug dax lug -> yellow blue green blue
    - Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow.""

- zup wif -> yellow red
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" When preceded by ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is added to the sequence.

- wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""red"" (though we do not have enough information on ""bluf,"" but it corresponds to ""red"" in this sequence). When ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" it introduces ""yellow"" before the ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

- dax zup dax -> green yellow green
    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" on either side of ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule that can be deduced from the examples is:

zup -> the word ""yellow"" is added in the output sequence where ""zup"" appears in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it occurs after the word ""wif,"" and to the color ""green"" when it follows any other word (like ""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""zup""). However, in the fifth example, it stands alone after the series ""lug walm wif"" and maps to two colors: ""red red.""

Considering this exception, it's difficult to deduce a single universal rule for ""bluf,"" as its meaning appears to be context-dependent. However, if we treat the fifth example as an anomaly or if there's an unseen underlying rule that we're missing due to the limited data (for instance, if repetition or the sequence length affects the meaning), we could suggest the following tentative rules:

When following ""wif"":
- bluf -> red

When following any word other than ""wif"":
- bluf -> green

With the exception of when following the sequence ""lug walm wif"":
- bluf -> red red

Therefore, one might tentatively propose:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" following ""wif"" and to ""green"" after other nouns, with an exception noted above.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns of the words and their corresponding outputs.

Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
Input: lug walm wif -> Output: blue blue blue red

Here are some observations:

1. When ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output is ""green,"" either alone or as part of a sequence.
2. When ""lug"" is present, the corresponding output is ""blue,"" either alone or as part of a sequence.
3. When ""zup"" is present, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
4. When ""wif"" is present, the corresponding output is ""red.""
5. ""Walm"" does not have a consistent color output associated with it.

From these observations, we notice that ""walm"" does not contribute a new color, but rather, it causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, ""walm"" acts as a repeater for the preceding color word.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after another word, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

walm -> causes repetition of the preceding word's associated color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: yellow green blue green,yellow green blue green,True,25
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the given context.
Rule: dax -> green

The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the word 'green' in the provided examples, regardless of the context in which it appears.
Rule: wif -> red

This rule is derived from the fact that in every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output includes ""red."" The color red is associated only with the presence of the word ""wif,"" and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the occurrence of ""wif"" and the output ""red,"" regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input string. This rule is supported by the given examples, where each ""wif"" corresponds to one ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example, regardless of its position in the sentence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to consistently map to the color ""blue."" Here's how:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is output as ""blue"" both times it appears.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" again maps to ""blue.""
- The fourth and fifth examples also support this, with ""bluf"" corresponding to ""blue.""

Hence, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" represents the color ""blue.""
walm -> to repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the color that corresponds to the preceding word is repeated for the number of times equivalent to the total number of syllables in the word preceding ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that each unique word is associated with a unique color. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" denotes the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color indicated by the previous word repeated. For instance:

- In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow"" repeated.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" results in ""red"" repeated.
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" mirrors ""red"" again.

Here is the deduced rule for ""bluf"":

bluf -> The color indicated by the previous word is repeated.
Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color three times. If the previous word/color is ""zup"", output ""yellow yellow yellow""; if it is ""wif"", output ""red red red""; and if it is ""lug"", output ""blue blue blue"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the standalone word ""lug"" is given in the input, the output is always ""blue."" This is consistent across all examples.

- When other words follow ""lug"" or precede it, the output still always includes ""blue"" for every occurrence of ""lug,"" but there are additional colors for other words.

- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" whenever it follows ""lug.""

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows ""lug.""

- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" whether it follows ""lug"" or not.

Given these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

lug -> blue. ""Lug"" always translates to the color ""blue.""

Additionally, the context suggests ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" though these translations are based on limited data and the rule induction is primarily focused on the word ""lug.""
Rule: dax -> green
Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given context.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the outputs, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
walm -> meaning. The meaning of walm seems to depend on a preceding word; walm results in a repetition of a color three times.

Rule:
1. When preceded by ""zup,"" walm results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. When preceded by ""wif,"" walm results in ""red red red.""
3. When preceded by ""lug,"" walm results in ""blue blue blue.""
4. ""dax"" as a standalone or following ""walm"" generates a single ""green.""
5. When ""walm"" is preceded by a color-indicating word (like ""zup,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug""), then followed by ""dax,"" the pattern is the triplet color according to the word before ""walm"" followed by a green. (Note the sequence in 'wif walm dax zup')

Based on the provided evidence, walm generates a triplet of a specific color based on the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently correlates with the output ""blue."" When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is simply ""blue."" When ""lug"" appears alongside another word, ""blue"" is part of the output and is preceded or followed by another color that seems to correspond to the additional word. Therefore:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word has a corresponding color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> (not enough data to determine)

There is no variation in the output when ""dax"" appears in different positions or combinations, which suggests that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of context.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" is associated with the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

In the examples:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" because bluf repeats the color of ""wif.""

2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax zup bluf"" produces ""green yellow yellow"" because bluf repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

3. The pattern is the same in ""wif dax bluf."" Here ""dax"" is the word before bluf, corresponding to ""green,"" so the output becomes ""red green green.""

4. In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" we see ""wif bluf"" repeating ""red red,"" and ""dax walm"" corresponding to ""green green green."" It's consistent with the rule that bluf repeats the color of the word before it.

5. ""wif bluf"" consistency remains with the output of ""red red.""

Thus, based on the examples given:
bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and corresponding output of each example to see if there is a pattern that connects ""walm"" to a color output or pattern of outputs.

Let’s look at the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   The word ""zup"" leads to one instance of ""yellow,"" and the occurrence of the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word before it thrice.

2. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is a repetition of ""green"" three times. Again, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word thrice.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   In this example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" The word ""walm"" appears twice and both times, it repeats the color output of the preceding word three times.

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has not been defined in previous examples but may correspond to ""red."" The ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, consistent with the previous examples.

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   As with the previous examples, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""walm"" after ""lug"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

From the above examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore: walm -> Repeat the preceding color thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,29
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, lug consistently translates to the color blue. Rule: lug means blue.
Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can determine a pattern. 'dax' always results in the word 'green' in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. The other words in the input correspond to different colors in the output, suggesting 'dax' simply maps to the color 'green'.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, we can notice that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax,"" and it corresponds to the color ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif."" In other examples that don't contain either ""dax"" or ""wif"" immediately preceding ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""blue.""

- dax bluf -> green
- wif bluf -> red
- bluf without dax or wif before it -> blue

So the rule for ""bluf"" could be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> if preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green""; if preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red""; if neither ""dax"" nor ""wif"" come before, the output is ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let us analyze the correlation between the input and the output sequences. We should look for patterns that could help us understand what ""walm"" stands for.

1. In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which implies that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of ""yellow,"" it could suggest that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the preceding color.

2. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" gives the output ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Following the same logic, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and given that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" the appearance of ""walm"" after ""zup zup"" results in an additional ""yellow"" before the sequence changes to ""green.""

3. In the sequence ""wif walm dax zup,"" if ""wif"" is ""red,"" then ""walm"" succeeding ""wif"" results in two additional ""red"" before changing to ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

4. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" turns into ""yellow green green green blue red."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" After ""walm,"" which follows ""dax,"" we see two more ""green"" before the color changes to ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

5. Lastly, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" ""Lug"" is consistently ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" Notably, after ""lug"" appears ""walm"" and we see a repetition of ""blue.""

Given the above analysis, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the previous color in the sequence, continuing until a new word implying a different color appears.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color that was mentioned just before ""walm"" continued until a different color word appears.

So:
walm -> causes a repetition of the previous color until a new color word is presented.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in every example provided, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Analyzing the provided input and output examples, we can attempt to induce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""wif.""

In each output where the input contains ""wif,"" the word ""red"" appears. Additionally, ""wif"" does not appear to translate directly to a single color, because it is in combination with other words, which also result in colors being outputted. The presence of ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red,"" but it's not the only color present in the output. Furthermore, repeated instances of ""zup wif"" result in the same output of ""yellow red,"" suggesting that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Considering that ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" irrespective of the context, we can induce the meaning or rule as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns for each input word and output color:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""walm"" results in ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

These consistent patterns suggest that each word corresponds to a specific color. Considering this, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue. Each time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, the output reflects the color blue. Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> blue
The examples provided each have a series of words, followed by a series of colors. By comparing these sequences, we can attempt to determine the meaning of ""walm.""

Let's compare the input with the corresponding output:

1. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
2. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
5. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""

Starting with the first example, we notice that ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and ""lug,"" resulting in ""green green green"" and ""blue blue blue"" respectively. In the third example, ""dax walm"" also results in ""green green green."" This suggests that ""walm"" might mean to repeat the color associated with the prior word three times.

In the examples where ""walm"" isn't directly following another word, the rule that ""walm"" causes the color to be repeated three times seems to hold:

- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and the new word ""wif"" leads to a new color ""red.""
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" presumably applies to ""wif,"" since it is the most recent word before ""walm,"" and results in ""red red red.""
- In ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" after ""lug"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" and then the colors change as new words are introduced.

Based on the evidence, it appears that ""walm"" indicates that the color of the word immediately preceding it should be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word 'wif' translates to the color 'red' in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. This correlation remains constant in all examples regardless of its position within the input string or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""zup"" is directly associated with the color yellow.

zup -> meaning. Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
Analyzing the input and output patterns, it seems that each unique input word corresponds to a unique color output. Here's the apparent mapping from the provided examples:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Given this mapping, it appears that ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word before it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", which suggests that ""walm"" means repeating the color associated with ""lug"" three times. Since ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, the pattern is that ""walm"" following any word causes a repetition of the respective color three times.
- The pattern holds for other examples too. ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"", therefore, ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats the color yellow three times.
- In the case of ""dax walm"", the output ""green green green"" indicates the same rule applies – ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color tied to ""dax"", which is green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue regardless of context.
Rule: dax -> green

Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" is part of the corresponding output.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word 'wif' translates to the color 'red' irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup"" and ""blue"" in other contexts. However, considering the consistent color output for other words (""lug"" always resulting in ""blue,"" ""dax"" always resulting in ""green,"" ""wif"" always resulting in ""red""), the most parsimonious rule for ""bluf"" is that it translates to ""blue"" in every context, and the occurrence of ""yellow"" is instead determined by the preceding word ""zup.""

With the above in mind, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""blue"". ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue,"" but when it follows ""zup,"" the output is influenced by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns within the provided examples, examining the output associated with ""walm"" each time it occurs:

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Observations:

1. ""Walm"" is always followed by an increase of one red color in the output. This pattern becomes more apparent as the word ""walm"" repeats and the number of reds increases immediately following it.
2. ""Walm"" does not change the color associated with other words; this change in color seems only to apply to the word immediately following ""walm.""
3. The color that precedes ""walm"" does not have a consistent pattern thus it does not affect the rule of “walm”.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color representing the word that follows it to become red, notably increasing the red count by one for each occurrence.

Rule: walm -> The following word is represented by the color red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" appears related to color representation. Each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given and the corresponding outputs, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears at the same position in the output.

Examples to support this rule:

- In the first example, both instances of ""wif"" lead to ""red"" in the output.
- Every other example containing ""wif"" also translates to ""red"" in its respective position in the output.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule as:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the exact same position in the output. There does not seem to be any additional context or other rules affecting the meaning of ""zup""; it is a direct substitution.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color of the word following it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears before a color word (like ""lug"" for blue or ""zup"" for yellow), it causes the output color to be repeated twice. If there is no color word following ""bluf,"" the last mentioned color is repeated.
walm -> meaning. By examining the presented patterns and their respective outputs, it appears that the word ""walm"" generates a series of ""green"" outputs that match the number of words preceding ""walm"" within the input series.

Rule: The number of green outputs corresponds to the quantity of words that come before ""walm"" in the input string. If there are two words before ""walm,"" two green outputs will follow; three words yield three green outputs, and so on.

wif -> red. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in every example provided. Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means red.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""zup."" Let's examine the evidence:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is part of the output.
- ""Zup"" seems to be independent of its position in the input; it always translates to ""yellow.""

Looking at this, we can induce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whether it is alone or part of a sequence, it retains this meaning. There is no evidence from the examples that ""zup"" changes meaning based on context or position.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word directly before bluf. 

In each example, the word that comes before ""bluf"" determines its output. The output consists of repeating the color associated with that preceding word. Here are the associations based on the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Thus, ""bluf"" takes the color assigned to the word before it and repeats it as many times as ""bluf"" is mentioned. For example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", and ""dax lug bluf dax"" results in ""green blue blue green"". The presence of ""lug"" before ""bluf"" and the subsequent ""dax"" indicates the colors blue for ""lug"", and green for ""dax"", are to be output in sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it looks like ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word that comes immediately before it three times. For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" 

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,35
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: ""lug"" means blue.
Rule: dax -> green

In each example provided where the word ""dax"" appears, the output includes the color ""green."" There is a direct correspondence between the occurrence of the word ""dax"" and the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Therefore, based on these examples, the meaning assigned to the nonce word ""dax"" is the color green.
Based on the input-output pairs provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Here is the pattern observed:

- When ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" shows up in the output.
- The number of times ""wif"" is present in the input corresponds to the number of times ""red"" appears in the output.
- There is a one-to-one relationship between the occurrence of ""wif"" and the word ""red"" without regard for the position of ""wif"" within the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" I'll analyze each example and look for a pattern in the position and corresponding output. 

1. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""zup"" occurs before ""bluf"" and is followed by another ""yellow"" in the output.

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   - ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" this time, which differs from the previous pattern.
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"", and the output after ""zup"" is green, matching ""dax"".

3. Input: lug zup lug
   Output: blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" is in between two instances of ""lug"" (blue).

4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""zup"" is between ""dax"" (green) and ""bluf"" (yellow).

5. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" is likely corresponding to ""blue"" as well  
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" occurs before ""wif"" (red) and is preceded by two instances of ""blue"".

Analyzing these patterns, ""zup"" doesn't correspond to any one specific color. Instead, it appears to be a functional word that affects the following word’s color. In the first, second, and fourth examples, the output color following ""zup"" matches the color of the following input word. The third example shows ""zup"" between two identical colors. The patterns suggest that ""zup"" may cause the following word to repeat the color of either the previous word or, in absence of a previous color match, maintains the color of the word it directly precedes.

However, the fifth example breaks this pattern since ""zup"" proceeds a color change rather than a repetition. Therefore, we need a unifying rule that can hold true across all examples.

Noticing that ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the color of the words around it, we can simplify the rule.

Rule: zup -> yellow

Regardless of the words before or after, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern that allows us to deduce the meaning or rule that the word ""bluf"" likely follows. Here is a breakdown of the observations:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- ""Bluf"" always appears at the end or in the middle, but never at the beginning.
- Whenever ""bluf"" is included, the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is duplicated in the output.

From this, we can induce that ""bluf"" might signify repetition or duplication of the color that corresponds to the word right before it. Hence:

bluf -> duplication of the previous color in the sequence.

Rule: If ""bluf"" is after a word, duplicate the color corresponding to that word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that when ""walm"" appears in an input, it is followed by a repetition of colors in the output. The specific color that is repeated is associated with the word that comes before ""walm"" in the input. Here's the correlation observed:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" is followed by three repetitions of the color ""blue.""
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"": ""wif"" is followed by three repetitions of the color ""red.""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"": ""dax"" is followed by three repetitions of the color ""green.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Thus, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: walm means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,36
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of the context or the other words around it. There doesn't appear to be any variation in the output associated with ""dax,"" suggesting that its meaning is not dependent on surrounding words. Therefore, we can infer the rule that ""dax"" maps to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

- When ""wif"" appears alone with ""lug,"" it translates to ""red blue.""
- When ""wif"" is surrounded by ""lug,"" as in ""lug wif lug,"" the sequence is ""blue red blue,"" implying that ""wif"" stands for ""red"" in this context.
- In the string ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif,"" ""wif"" at the end translates to ""red.""
- In ""dax walm wif dax,"" ""wif"" appears amidst words that translate into ""green"" and results in ""red.""
- Again, in ""dax wif lug,"" we have ""wif"" between words that translate to ""green"" and ""blue,"" but ""wif"" once more translates to ""red.""

Based on these observations, it's consistent across all examples that the word ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" the corresponding color for that word is repeated.
Analyzing the given examples:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
3. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
5. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow

From the above examples, we can infer the following:

- The word preceding ""walm"" seems to determine the color that is repeated.
- ""zup walm"" results in three ""yellow"" which suggests that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it, in this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red"", indicating that ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times and ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.
- The third example supports this rule, with ""dax zup dax walm"" resulting in ""green yellow green green green"" whereby ""walm"" comes after another ""dax"" and three greens are output.
- The fourth and fifth examples further reinforce the rule, as ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"" and ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow"", respectively. The presence of ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" after a word causes the color corresponding to that word to be repeated three times.

Therefore:
walm -> the color corresponding to the previous word is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Regardless of its position in the sequence (beginning, middle, or end), ""dax"" always maps to ""green"". There are no exceptions or additional context needed to alter this relationship in the given examples.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"". In each instance where ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the exact same position in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, the term ""yellow"" appears in the output at the same position. This consistent correlation suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"" in this context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" when combined with another word generates a repetition of the color associated with that word. Here's the mapping from the provided examples:

- lug bluf -> blue blue
- wif bluf -> red red
- dax bluf -> green green

Moreover, when two or three distinct words precede ""bluf,"" the pattern of repeated colors is broken by the new color introduced by the word immediately before ""bluf."" This is seen here:

- lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
- wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
- dax wif bluf -> green red red

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If a different word (and thus a different color) comes right before ""bluf,"" it will instead result in a repetition of the new color. If ""bluf"" is used with more than one distinct word before it, it follows the color pattern set by those words until the sequence ends with ""bluf,"" which then doubles the last color mentioned. 

Therefore:

bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word changes, it repeats the color associated with the new word.
walm -> to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows any given word, the color associated with that preceding word is to be repeated three times in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in each example.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by examining its position relative to the other words and the corresponding outputs. Here's what we can see from the examples:

1. When ""wif"" appears first, the corresponding output color is red:
   - wif zup lug -> red yellow blue
   - wif zup -> red yellow

2. When ""wif"" appears in the middle, the corresponding output color seems to be red based on the single example provided:
   - zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

3. When ""wif"" appears last, we don't have a direct example, but based on the positioning of the other words and their corresponding colors in the second example, it's reasonable to deduce that it may still correspond to red.

Now, let's examine the output colors when ""wif"" is alongside other words:

- ""lug"" always corresponds with blue.
- ""zup"" always corresponds with yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds with green.

The consistent pattern regardless of position is that ""wif"" corresponds with red. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look for a consistent pattern in each example.

In the first example, when ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue"" followed by the next color that follows ""bluf"" in the sequence. For instance:

- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" 

- We see that ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" once, which corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

- ""Zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"" both before and after ""bluf.""

- ""Zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Here, ""wif"" is translated as ""red.""

Observing each instance of ""bluf,"" we see it duplicates the color that follows it. In cases where ""bluf"" is the last word, it is assumed to be ""blue"" since there is no color to copy.

Now, let's summarize the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the next word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the final word, its color defaults to ""blue.""

So, bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means to duplicate the color of the following word, defaulting to ""blue"" if it is the last word in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" induces repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it in the sequence. We can observe this pattern in the given examples:

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green (lug corresponds to blue, walm repeats blue)

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red (wif corresponds to red, walm repeats red)

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green (dax corresponds to green, walm repeats green)

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green (dax corresponds to green, walm repeats green)

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green (dax corresponds to green, walm repeats green)

Based on these observations, the word ""walm"" appears to be a command to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the input and output examples provided, it is consistent that every occurrence of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"". There are no examples suggesting lug has any other meaning or changes based on context within the provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be correlated with the output ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""red."" Furthermore, the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence doesn't seem to affect its corresponding output color, as it is consistently ""red"" regardless of its place in the sequence.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"" as follows:

wif -> meaning: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, include ""red"" in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the patterns observed in the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" There is no indication from the examples provided that the meaning of ""zup"" depends on context or position within the input sequence. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the rule is as follows:

When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" However, ""bluf"" results in two instances of ""blue"" at the end of the Output. In all the other cases, words in the input correspond to a single color in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" duplicates the color it represents, which is blue, only when it occurs at the end of the input string.

Rule: bluf -> When 'bluf' appears, it corresponds to ""blue,"" and if it's at the end of the sequence, it duplicates the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples, it seems like the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm zup"" leads to ""green green green yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and it causes the repetition of the previous color, green, for three times before showing its own color.
- In the second example, ""walm wif"" results in ""green green green red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and again, the green is repeated three times before showing red.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is repeated as an effect of ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green,"" here ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and it comes after the effects of ""walm,"" which has caused ""lug"" (blue) to repeat.
- In the final example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" gives us ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" which follows the same pattern where ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and then allows the sequence to continue normally with the colors corresponding to the rest of the words.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the following word to repeat for a certain number of times (in this case, three times) before outputting the color corresponding to that word.

walm -> causes the following word's associated color to repeat three times before showing its own associated color.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" appears to indicate the color blue.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the color blue is included in the output. If other words are present with ""lug,"" they correspond to additional colors that are paired with the specific words. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. If ""lug"" appears alone, the output is solely blue.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" across all the given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word wif translates to the color red in the output regardless of its position in the input.
zup -> yellow

Rule:
Whenever the word ""zup"" is present as an input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" This is consistent across all examples provided, regardless of what other words accompany ""zup"" or if ""zup"" appears alone as the input.
Based on the provided examples, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Input: zup bluf wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow red red

The word ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and precedes the word ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" In both occurrences of ""bluf"" in this input, the output is the color that does not appear either directly before or after ""bluf.""

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red

Again, the outputs for ""bluf"" are ""yellow"" which is not directly next to ""bluf"" in the sequence.

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue

Here, ""bluf"" is succeeded by ""wif"" (red) but the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" This is consistent with what we have seen in the previous patterns.

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Again, in the final ""bluf"" instance, the surrounding words are ""zup"" (yellow), but ""bluf"" itself translates to ""yellow.""

Based on the data, the rule seems to be: ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Looking at each example, ""walm"" does not correspond to the same color. This suggests that ""walm"" does not have a static color representation like ""dax"" which consistently maps to green or ""wif"" which consistently maps to red.

Observing the position of ""walm"" and the color that follows it, we notice a pattern: ""walm"" causes the subsequent word to repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm"":

1. ""wif walm dax"" yields ""red red red"" - here ""walm"" causes ""dax"" to inherit ""wif""'s red color.
2. ""dax walm zup lug"" yields ""green green green yellow blue"" - here ""walm"" causes ""zup"" to inherit ""dax""'s green color.
3. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" yields ""yellow green green green yellow red"" - here ""walm"" causes the second ""zup"" to repeat the green from ""dax"".
4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" yields ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"" - here ""walm"" causes the last ""lug"" to repeat the red from ""wif"".
5. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" yields ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" - here ""walm"" causes the final ""zup"" to inherit ""lug""'s blue color.

Rule: walm -> causes the following word to repeat the color output of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce a rule for the nonce word ""dax."" In every ""Input,"" when the word ""dax"" is included, it correlates with ""green"" in the corresponding ""Output,"" regardless of what other words are present or their order.

Here are the correlations observed:

1. ""dax"" on its own results in ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output sequence starts with ""green blue.""
3. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within a sequence (beginning, middle, end), the first color in the output sequence after ""dax"" is mentioned is always ""green.""

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here's the analysis for each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and therefore repeats the color red.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" (which hasn't been defined but seems to follow ""dax"") results in another green.

2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" again repeats the color of the word before it, which is red.

3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - ""bluf"" follows the second ""wif"" and thus the output is red again.

4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is assumed to be yellow based on the output following ""zup.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" appears in the input, it causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.
To find the rule, let's look at the outputs corresponding to each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue

From the given examples, ""walm"" always results in the output repeating the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"":

1. ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" we have ""green green"" (repeating ""green"" because the preceding word was ""dax"").
2. When ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" we again see a repetition of ""green"" for a total of ""green green green.""
3. ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to yellow, which leads to a repetition of yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. and 5. In both cases, ""zup"" is the word before ""walm,"" giving us ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, is unaffected by ""walm"" and appears only once at the beginning and end of the sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to repeat three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is a modifier that triggers the repetition of the output color associated with the word directly before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output. Here are the associations made in each example:

- In the first input, ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to a single instance of the color blue in the output.
- In the second input, ""lug"" again corresponds to a single instance of the color blue in the output.
- In the third and fourth inputs, ""lug"" also corresponds to the color blue in the output each time it appears.
- In the fifth input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and both correspond to the color blue three times in the output.

Given these examples, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the output of the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> same color as the previous word.
Based on the given examples, we can infer a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Notice that whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output consists of a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- The second example has ""zup"" before ""walm"" again, and the output repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- The third example has ""dax"" before ""walm,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Following ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and again, ""yellow"" is repeated three times. After ""dax,"" the output is two ""greens,"" and after ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- The fifth example starts with ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" After ""dax,"" we get ""green,"" and after ""zup walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated thrice.

It appears that ""walm"" causes the next three outputs to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, each occurrence of the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the Output. 

Therefore: dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green.
From examining the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Here's how I came to this conclusion:

- Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the inputs is directly translated to ""red"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the given input string.
- The output is consistently ""red"" when ""wif"" appears, and for the other words (""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm""), the colors are not necessarily ""red"" and correspond to other colors or a sequence thereof.

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule is:
wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in all provided inputs and outputs.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs. We also need to notice the regularity in appearance and the output that corresponds to each appearance.

Let's list each distinct word and their corresponding colors from the inputs and outputs, where possible, to see if we can identify a pattern:

First Input/Output pair:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow (first instance), blue (second instance)
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- dax -> green

Second Input/Output pair:
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red

Third Input/Output pair:
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue (first instance), yellow (second instance)
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Fourth Input/Output pair:
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Fifth Input/Output pair:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green

From these observations, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently maps to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue (except once where it is followed by ""dax"", so it might be green and ""dax"" clears the blue), and ""dax"" to green. The word ""bluf"" appears to vary, as it corresponds to either yellow or blue, with no immediately apparent rule when considering position alone.

However, we might notice a pattern if we consider the word that appears right before ""bluf"":

1. When ""zup"" appears before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" is yellow.
2. When ""wif"" or ""lug"" appear before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" is blue.

Given this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color blue by default, except when preceded by the word ""zup,"" in which case it becomes yellow.

Rule: ""bluf"" maps to yellow when preceded by ""zup""; otherwise, it maps to blue.

So, we can state:

bluf -> blue (default)
bluf -> yellow (if preceded by ""zup"")
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the recurring patterns and relationships between the input and output.

Examining the examples, we can notice the following:

- In the first example, 'dax walm wif walm zup' corresponds to 'green green green red red red yellow'. We can see that 'dax' corresponds to the first 'green', and the sequence 'wif walm zup' coincides with 'red red red yellow'. Since 'zup' is consistent with 'yellow' in other examples, 'wif' may correspond with an initial 'red', and 'walm' causes the color 'red' to repeat.

- In the second example, 'dax zup walm wif' translates to 'green yellow yellow yellow red'. 'dax' is paired with 'green' again, 'zup' with the first 'yellow', while 'wif' is paired with 'red'. Here 'walm' seems to cause the repeat of 'yellow'.

- In the third example, 'wif lug walm' translates to 'red blue blue blue'. 'wif' pairs with 'red' and 'lug' with 'blue'. It suggests that 'walm' when between two words that have already been associated with colors, appears to duplicate the color associated with the word preceding it.

- The fourth example, 'lug walm zup wif', produces 'blue blue blue yellow red'. Here 'lug' corresponds with 'blue', 'zup' with 'yellow', and 'wif' with 'red'. The word 'walm' again duplicates the color associated with the term preceding it, which is 'blue'.

- The fifth example, 'zup walm wif', translates to 'yellow yellow yellow red'. 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'wif' to 'red', with 'walm' once more causing the color 'yellow' to repeat.

From the above observations, it is evident that 'walm' causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated until another color is mentioned. 

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the word right before it until a different color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every time the word 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the corresponding position in the output. This consistent substitution suggests that 'dax' means 'green'.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- The output following ""dax"" is ""green.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup,"" but ""green"" when it's after ""dax.""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue"" when it follows ""zup.""
- ""wif"" brings up ""red"" in the presence of ""zup.""

From this, we can deduce a rule for ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

It seems that ""zup"" indicates the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or occurrence in the sequence.
To find the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the outputs next to it and look for a pattern.

1. When ""bluf"" is present:
   - ""dax bluf zup"" -> green green yellow
   - ""lug bluf zup lug"" -> blue blue yellow blue
   - ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> blue red green green red blue
   - ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Looking at the contexts where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding color outputs, we notice that when ""bluf"" is present, the color immediately before ""bluf"" appears twice in the output (green green, blue blue, blue blue, green green, red red).

Based on this pattern, we can induce that ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color directly preceding it in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> replicate the preceding color in the output sequence.
walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to represent a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 
Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
Based on the usage of ""dax"" in the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" consistently. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, each nonce word seems to correspond to a color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" There is no context given that alters the meaning of ""wif"" in different uses; it always results in ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""zup"" appears in every input and consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There doesn't appear to be any additional context that changes the meaning of ""zup"" in the given inputs; it is always matched with ""yellow"" irrespective of its position or the words around it. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to a color. The color it translates to depends on the word that comes immediately before it.

Here are the observations:

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output color is yellow.
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output color is green.
3. There is no instance where ""wif"" or ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", so we cannot deduce their corresponding colors.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The color output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color represented by the word immediately preceding it.

Let's apply this rule to the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"", so ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and so does ""bluf"".
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", so ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""bluf"" takes on that same color.
- The third example confirms this rule, as ""zup bluf"" again translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- The fourth example shows ""lug bluf"" as ""blue blue"", suggesting ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""bluf"" again takes on the color of the preceding word.
- The fifth example has ""lug bluf wif"" which translates to ""blue blue red"", confirming that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""blue"" from ""lug"", but we cannot establish a rule for ""wif"" as we don't have an instance of a word before ""wif"" that would explain its corresponding color.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it takes the color associated with the word immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, a repeating sequence of the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" is produced. Specifically, the sequence of the color repeats thrice.
- Example 1: ""wif"" denotes ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows, it results in ""red red red.""
- Example 2: ""lug"" denotes ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows, it results in ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be when ""walm"" follows a word, the output will be the color corresponding to that word, repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of context within the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: dax -> green

Each time the word ""dax"" is presented in the input, the output is ""green."" There does not appear to be any variation or condition that changes this result within the given examples. Therefore, the meaning assigned to ""dax"" is ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. 

Thus, the rule we can deduce for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence:

- In the first example, ""zup"" at both the beginning and the end of the sequence maps to ""yellow.""
- In the second and third examples, ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" at the end of the sequence.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" at the beginning of the sequence maps to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" at both the second and fourth positions maps to ""yellow.""

None of the surrounding words (dax, walm, lug, wif) alter the output of ""zup,"" which always corresponds to ""yellow."" Other words like ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" seem to correspond to other specific colors.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to trigger the duplication of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately follows it. Here's the observed pattern:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> ""red red blue green red""

In each output, the word following ""bluf"" is represented twice in its corresponding color. The rules of the different color representations are consistent across the examples (wif -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green, walm is carried over as green from prior usage assuming it corresponds to green as well). Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> replicate the color denoted by the following word.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to relate to the repetition of the color that directly follows the word ""lug."" Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. In ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""lug"" is followed by a ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Thus, ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""yellow.""

2. In ""lug walm"", the only color occurring after ""lug"" is ""blue,"" thus ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""blue.""

3. In ""wif lug walm"", ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated.

4. Similarly, in ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" precedes ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue.""

5. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" within this series, there are two instances of ""lug."" The relevant one for ""walm"" is the one preceding it, ""lug zup."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""yellow."" The last ""lug"" is followed by no color, suggesting it might not have any influence, or it follows the previous pattern and repeats the last said color, which is ""yellow.""

Based on the above examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color of the word that follows the immediately preceding ""lug.""

This rule would make ""walm"" an instruction to repeat the preceding associated color word in triple.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

So, dax -> green.

bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" In each example where the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we analyze the input sentences and their respective outputs in order to identify a pattern.

In the first input-output sequence:
- ""wif walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""

In the second input-output sequence:
- ""zup lug walm"" matches with ""yellow blue blue blue""

In the third input-output sequence:
- ""dax walm zup lug"" aligns with ""green green green yellow blue""

In the fourth input-output sequence:
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green green green red red""

In the fifth input-output sequence:
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" aligns with ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""

Analyzing the patterns, we can see that each time the word ""walm"" appears, three of the same color appear in the output, and the color is determined by the word preceding ""walm."" More specifically:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all examples provided.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, the word ""wif"" has a consistent output which is ""red"". This suggests that the meaning of ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Therefore, the rule we can deduce from the examples is as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""
zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Observing the given examples:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
2. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
3. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
4. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".

Given that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color as well given the examples, and each instance of ""bluf"" is met with a repeated color in the output that is not immediately associated with another word, it is reasonable to deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the previous color.

Let's validate this rule with the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"", the output is ""green red red"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif"", which is ""red"".

- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif"", the output is ""blue blue red"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color for ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

- In the third example, ""dax lug bluf dax"", the output is ""green blue blue green"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color for ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", we don't have a direct association for ""walm"", but ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and is represented twice as ""blue blue"" at the end, which fits.

- In the fifth example, ""dax zup bluf"", the output is ""green yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first look at the outputs associated with the word in each input sequence:

1. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
2. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> green yellow yellow yellow red
3. ""dax walm"" -> green green green
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> green green green red red
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Based on these examples, we can observe that whenever ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the following color output is repeated an extra time. More specifically, it appears the term ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in total. This can be verified by the sequences given:

- In example 1, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 2, ""zup walm"" also results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- In example 4, ""dax walm"" again leads to ""green green green.""
- In example 5, ""zup walm"" once more results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Here is the rule deduced:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated two additional times, making three appearances in total.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

According to the given examples, every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output, regardless of the presence of other words. This consistent one-to-one mapping suggests that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rules:

- Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"".
- The word ""lug"" results in the color ""blue"".
- The word ""wif"" results in the color ""red"".
- The word ""zup"" results in the color ""yellow"".
- The word ""bluf"" results in the color ""blue"" (seemingly identical to ""lug"").

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

This rule consistently applies across all the provided examples.
Rule: wif translates to red, and any additional word following wif corresponds to another color. 'lug' translates to blue, and 'dax' translates to green.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the examples provided, whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output, except for the times when ""bluf"" follows another word where it then takes the color of the word that preceded it.

Here are the patterns observed:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in all instances.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in all instances.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in all instances.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in all instances.
- ""bluf"" follows the color of the word before it, if there is one, or defaults to ""yellow"" if there's no word prior to it.

Applying the rule:

1. zup lug zup lug zup bluf: Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
2. dax bluf wif zup: Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green"", so ""bluf"" is ""green"".
3. dax zup bluf: Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
4. zup bluf wif lug dax: Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
5. dax lug wif bluf: Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red"", so ""bluf"" is ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence, or defaults to ""yellow"" if it is at the beginning or if no preceding word exists.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word or defaults to ""yellow"" if it is the first word or there is no preceding color word.
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be repeated repetition of the previous color word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the directly preceding word to be repeated in the output for the number of times ""walm"" is said. If ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, the repetition continues until the end of the sequence. If ""walm"" is followed by another color word, the repetition stops, and the sequence continues as normal.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the output is ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems like the nonce word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Each time 'wif' appears, the output includes the word 'red'. 

Moreover, the other words translate to specific colors, consistently appearing in a one-to-one relationship with those colors in the output. Here is the apparent mapping based on the given information:
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, given this pattern, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Given the examples provided, we can attempt to determine a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". Let's analyze each example and its output:

1. Input: wif bluf dax 
   Output: red red green

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug 
   Output: red yellow yellow blue

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup 
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

4. Input: dax bluf zup 
   Output: green green yellow

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug 
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

By examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to identify a rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output produces a word with a color that matches the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Using this analysis, we can infer the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word immediately before it.

Therefore:

bluf -> takes on the color meaning of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" replicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The repetition occurs three times.

To illustrate this, we can break down the examples as follows:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm
   - dax -> green
   - lug -> blue
   - wif -> red
   - walm follows wif, so walm -> red red red
   
2. Input: lug zup dax walm
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - dax -> green
   - walm follows dax, so walm -> green green green
   
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   - zup -> yellow
   - bluf -> yellow (same as the zup color, hence yellow)
   - wif -> red
   - walm follows wif, so walm -> red red red
   
4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   - wif -> red
   - dax -> green
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm follows zup, so walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   - dax -> green
   - walm follows dax, so first walm -> green green green
   - wif -> red
   - walm follows wif, so second walm -> red red red
   - zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm means to repeat the color of the word that comes before it three times. 

Hence:
walm -> repeat the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the given examples and find the commonality in each.

1. When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is simply ""green"" as seen in the first example.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" also results in ""green,"" followed by two ""green""s and a ""red"" for subsequent words.
3. In the third example, ""dax"" leads to ""green"" again, followed by ""red"" and ""blue"" and finishing with ""green"" for the second ""dax.""
4. With the fourth example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" with ""lug"" being ""blue"" both times it is mentioned, and ""walm"" is ""blue"" as well.
5. In the final example, ""dax"" is consistently ""green"" with each occurrence.

The consistent rule that can be deduced from these examples is that the word ""dax"" always maps to ""green"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples given, we can induce the following meanings for the nonce word ""zup"":

zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color immediately preceding it. If there is no color mentioned before ""bluf,"" it repeats the same color as the preceding word/color. Therefore, the rule is: Repeat the color of the preceding word/color. If there's no preceding color, repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or context within the given examples.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red"". Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is seen in the input, the output is ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the output echoing the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". If the preceding word is ""dax"", the output is ""green green"". If the preceding word is ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".

Thus, bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, each time adding another instance. For example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
    - dax -> green
    - lug -> blue
    - walm repeats the color word before it (blue) three more times
   Output: green blue blue blue

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
    - wif -> red
    - zup -> yellow
    - lug -> blue
    - dax -> green
    - zup -> yellow
    - walm repeats the color word before it (yellow) three more times
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
    - dax -> green
    - lug -> blue
    - walm repeats the color word before it (blue) three more times
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue

4. Input: wif lug walm
    - wif -> red
    - lug -> blue
    - walm repeats the color word before it (blue) three more times
   Output: red blue blue blue

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
    - lug -> blue
    - walm repeats the color word before it (blue) three more times
    - wif -> red
    - bluf seems unrelated to the rule for walm; its meaning is not explicitly provided by the examples
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows: 

Rule: walm -> repeats the preceding color word three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"". 

Here's the analysis of each example:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' at both the beginning and end, and 'bluf' corresponds to 'red'.

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - 'wif' appears to correspond to 'red' since it is the first word in both the input and output. 'bluf' corresponds to double 'blue', as seen from both instances in the input and output.

3. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

4. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - 'wif' on its own corresponds to 'red'.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - Here 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'walm' seems to correspond to 'red', 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.

From these examples, the simplest rule that can be deduced is that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The presence of the word ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the translation, irrespective of its position in the input sentence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the provided examples, it's possible to infer the following pattern:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue""
- ""zup"" has resulted in ""yellow"" twice

Now, considering the output associated with ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax"", with the outputs being ""red"" and ""green"", respectively.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output for both is ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and both outputs are ""red"".

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it duplicates the output of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the output color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. In every example, the output following ""walm"" is the same color word repeated multiple times, which is the translation of the word before ""walm."" The only variation to this pattern is when ""walm"" is at the end of the input, in which case the color associated with the second-to-last word is repeated three times in the output.

To summarize the observations:

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
2. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
3. Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green
4. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
5. Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue

In examples 1 and 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and in the output, ""blue"" (associated with ""lug"") is repeated three times, except in example 5 where ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and ""blue"" appears only once at the end. In examples 2 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax"", respectively, and in the output, ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") and ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") are repeated three times. Example 3 is the same as 2 and 4, with ""walm"" at the end and ""green"" repeated three times. Example 4 shows that if ""walm"" is the last word in the input, the color corresponding to the second-to-last word is still repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times, or repeated multiple times with a single instance of the initial color if another color word follows.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times, or if ""walm"" is followed by another color word, repeat the previous color multiple times but include a single instance of the following color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> ""blue"". 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of the context in which it is used. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input leads to an additional ""blue"" in the output.
After analyzing the presented examples, a pattern emerges where each unique word is associated with a color:

- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"".
- The word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- The word ""walm"" seems to translate to the color ""green"" each time it appears.

Here's the rule based on the given examples:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> green

Rule: Each word in the input is systematically translated to a specific color in the output.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Here is the rule derived from the examples:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

Examples:

- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".
- In ""dax lug bluf wif"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, so ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".
- In ""dax bluf wif"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is green, so ""bluf"" translates to ""green"".
- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".
- In ""wif bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red, so ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".

Thus, the meaning of ""bluf"" in all contexts is to repeat the color of the word right before it.
Walm -> meaning. The meaning appears to be to repeat the color associated with the previous word one additional time.

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the output repeats the color of the previous word, effectively doubling that color in the output sequence. For example, if ""wif"" translates to red, then ""wif walm"" would result in ""red red red"".

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" In every example given, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
Given the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's an analysis of the examples provided:

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" duplicates it.

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green
- Each occurrence of ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word before it: the second ""dax"" is green, so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"".

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" duplicates it.

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" duplicates it; likewise for ""dax"" which corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" then duplicates this green.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" duplicates it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf duplicates the color of the word that precedes it.
Looking at each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs and their respective outputs, we can attempt to identify a pattern for the word ""walm.""

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which appears to correspond to ""yellow."" We observe a repetition of ""yellow"" three times in the output.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- In this sequence, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" consistent with the first example. It does not seem affected by the presence of ""bluf"" (blue) and ""lug.""

Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which seems to represent ""green,"" observed in the output as three repetitions of ""green.""

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""Walm"" appears twice, first after ""wif,"" translating to ""red red red,"" and then following a ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which follows the recognized pattern.

Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
- In this context, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which seems to be associated with ""red,"" and the pattern of three repetitions is consistent.

From these examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the word directly preceding it to be repeated three times in the output color. Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be ""repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" This can be observed by its presence in different positions within the input strings and its consistent translation in the output.

Thus, the rule is as follows:
dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- ""wif"" always generates an output of ""red red red""
- Each instance of a unique non-""wif"" word corresponds to a unique color in the sequence

From the first example:
- ""wif walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
  This indicates ""wif"" is ""red red red"" and ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""walm"" is repeated.

From the second example:
- ""wif walm"" corresponding to ""red red red"" reaffirms that ""wif"" is ""red red red"".

From the third example:
- ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green blue"". We know ""wif"" is ""red"", so ""zup"" is likely ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""Bluf"" doesn't seem to correspond to a color here, but since ""bluf"" occurs only once and each word corresponds to a pair or trio of colors, it could be an error or it's a non-contributing word in this sequence.

From the fourth example:
- ""dax wif zup dax"" corresponds to ""green red yellow green"", which supports the color associations for ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"".

From the fifth example:
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow"". ""Wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"" after ""wif"". Since ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it seems ""bluf"" could be contributing to the ""yellow"" after ""zup"", suggesting that ""bluf"" and ""zup"" together correspond to ""yellow yellow"".

Piecing this together, the meaning associated with ""wif"" doesn't depend on context but is a fixed output signal. Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red red red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow.""

Rule:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by analyzing the pattern present in both the inputs and outputs. 

Looking at the first example:

- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red.""

Here we see that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Therefore, the word ""bluf"" coincides with the transition to repeating the color that just appeared.

Continuing with the other examples:

- ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" translates to ""blue green green red green.""

Again, the word ""bluf"" precedes a repetition of ""green.""

- ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue.""

The word ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of ""blue.""

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""

The word ""bluf"" is followed by a repeat of the yellow color.

- ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue.""

Again, ""bluf"" precedes a repeated color; this time it's ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Hence, ""bluf"" causes the following color to be a repeat of the color directly preceding it.
From the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to function as a word that repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it. Here's how this interpretation plays out across the given examples:

1. In ""lug walm wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" immediately follows it, thus resulting in another ""blue."" Then ""wif"" is ""red.""
   Output: blue blue blue red

2. In ""wif lug walm,"" ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"" and is immediately followed by ""walm,"" which leads to another ""blue."" ""Wif"" is ""red"" at either beginning or end because the pattern remains consistent, regardless of position.
   Output: red blue blue blue

3. In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the color of ""wif.""
   Output: red red red

4. In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" each ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows the ""wif"" here which is ""red,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color ""red."" ""Bluf,"" which is unfamiliar based on the previous patterns, can be deduced to correspond to ""blue"" as it precedes a ""wif"" leading to ""red.""
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

5. In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows it, thereby repeating the color ""blue.""
   Output: blue blue blue

Based on this information, we can construct the following rule:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we can identify patterns from the given input-output pairs. We'll compare the positions and occurrences of ""dax"" in the input sentences with the matching colors in the output sequences:

1. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green yellow blue green
2. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. dax wif walm -> green red red red
4. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
5. zup wif dax -> yellow red green

Based on the inputs and outputs, we can observe the following:

- Every time the input begins with ""dax,"" the output begins with green. 
- Whenever ""dax"" is directly followed by ""walm,"" we see a sequence of two green colors in the output, suggesting a rule where ""dax walm"" together translates to a two-fold ""green.""
- ""dax"" is green irrespective of position; it's green when it starts the input, ends the input, or is in the middle.
- The word that follows ""dax"" affects the color that comes after green if it's not ""walm"" (e.g., ""wif"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green red"").

Let's formulate a rule. Considering that ""dax"" consistently translates to green regardless of its position and the influence of the following word on the subsequent color, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"" but also has an effect on the following word's color output based on an undetermined set of rules.
Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color immediately preceding it. Here are the rules that support this deduction:

- In the first example, ""wif lug zup"" translates to ""red blue yellow"", and then ""walm"" is followed by ""wif lug"", resulting in a repeated ""yellow"" for every ""walm"" before the ""wif lug"" sequence resumes with ""red blue"".
- In the second example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"", and ""walm"" follows, causing a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- In the third example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"", followed by ""walm"", which again results in a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"" that results in ""yellow"" being repeated two times, and then ""dax lug"" follows and translates to ""green blue"".
- The last example just has ""zup walm"", translating to ""yellow"" followed by ""walm"" repeating ""yellow"" two more times.

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Replicate the color word that precedes it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" by looking at its consistency across different inputs:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" appears with ""bluf"", which by itself corresponds to ""red"", the output is ""blue blue"", which suggests ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"".
- In a more complex input such as ""wif dax lug walm"", we see that ""lug"" is followed by three instances of ""blue"" in the output, suggesting that it might contribute a single ""blue"" to the output sequence regardless of what follows it.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the provided examples. It does not seem to be affected by its position in the input or by other words present.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Regardless of the context in which ""zup"" appears within the given examples, the output consistently includes the word ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> yellow when following zup, green when following dax, blue when following lug.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us look at each occurrence of the word and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   
2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   
3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   
4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
5. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Observing the patterns, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times. Each word seems to have a color associated with it:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Thus, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output repeats the color of that word three times. Additionally, ""walm"" does not seem to have an associated color of its own, as no new color is introduced after its triplet. Instead, it possibly serves as a repeating mechanism for the previous color, and after ""walm"" has exerted its effect, the pattern continues with the next color word's corresponding color.

Rule: walm -> repeats the output color of the preceding word three times

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, lug consistently results in the output of 'blue'. Therefore, we can deduce that lug corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in every provided example.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Considering the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us look for patterns in the examples provided. 

1. Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red
2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
5. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red

Now let's look for consistencies concerning ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the color green follows ""dax,"" and subsequent colors are green until a new word appears.
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the color is blue, and subsequent colors are red until a new word appears.
3. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the color is red, and subsequent colors are red until a new word appears.

Based on the patterns observed, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it until a new word is introduced. 

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word until a new word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, lug consistently translates to the word ""blue.""

Rule: lug means blue.
Rule: Dax -> green

The examples show that every time the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following rules:

1. When ""wif"" appears on its own, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue.""

There is not enough information to deduce the relationship between ""wif"" and ""walm"" in the third example, as ""walm"" is present only once. However, since ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" and ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue,"" we might assume that ""wif"" contributes ""red"" to the output sequence.

Therefore, we can deduce:

wif -> red

This means that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" As we have only one example where ""wif"" is part of a longer sequence (""dax wif walm""), and we do not know what ""dax"" or ""walm"" mean, we can only establish the meaning of ""wif"" as ""red"" with the given data.

Rule:
- Whenever ""wif"" is presented as an input, the first part of the output is ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in a sequence.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

- When 'dax' (which translates to 'green') precedes 'bluf', the output for 'bluf' is 'green'.
- When 'zup' (which translates to 'yellow') precedes 'bluf', the output for 'bluf' is 'yellow'.
- When 'wif' (which translates to 'red') precedes 'bluf', the output for 'bluf' is 'red'.
- When 'lug' (which translates to 'blue') precedes 'bluf', the output for 'bluf' is 'blue'.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the previously mentioned color. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds with the number of times ""walm"" is said consecutively. 

walm -> Repeat the color that comes just before the first ""walm"" as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned continuously.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,62
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is used, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. 

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red in the output, regardless of its position in the input. All examples that contain the word ""wif"" result in the word ""red"" as part of the output.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of the word ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" to the output sequence before the color that corresponds to the next word. Here is how the output breaks down:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The two instances of ""zup"" before them add a ""yellow"" to the sequence before the color of the following word. 
- In the second and third examples, ""zup"" before ""dax"" adds a ""yellow"" before ""green"", and ""zup"" before ""wif"" adds a ""yellow"" before ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""zup"" before ""walm"" adds additional ""yellow"" in the sequence before ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, since only ""zup dax"" is given, ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" before the ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: zup -> ""adds a yellow before the color corresponding to the next word.""
Rule: bluf -> red

Observing the examples:

Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Bluf"" must represent ""red"" as it occurs between ""wif"" and ""zup"".

Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and also produces ""blue"". However, in this instance ""bluf"" must be ""red"" to maintain consistency with the other examples.

Input: zup bluf lug
Output: yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and the result is another ""yellow"", reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" is red as it turns to the original color repeating the word that precedes it.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""Wif"" is ""red"", ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax"" and the output is ""red"" again for ""bluf"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""Zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"", followed by ""bluf"" which once again results in ""red"".

In each case, ""bluf"" results in an output of ""red"", implying that it translates to ""red"" regardless of what word precedes or follows it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' causes the subsequent word to repeat the color associated with the previous word. It seems to be a command for repetition or duplication in terms of the color association in the output until a new color-word pair is introduced without the modifier 'walm'. 

Here's the breakdown of examples with the assumed meaning of 'walm':

- Example 1: 
  - ""dax wif zup"" translates to ""green red yellow""
  - ""bluf wif"" would normally translate to ""blue red""
  - Because 'walm' comes before ""bluf wif"", instead of translating to ""blue red"", it repeats the color of ""wif"" which is red, resulting in ""red red"".
  
- Example 2:
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
  - ""walm dax"" maintains the repetition of yellow instead of switching to ""green"" for ""dax""
  - ""lug"" breaks the pattern and introduces ""blue"".

- Example 3:
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
  - ""walm"" again forces a repetition, so ""zup"", which would normally be yellow, is green.

- Example 4:
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
  - ""walm lug"" causes ""lug"" to be 'yellow' instead of its usual ""blue""
  - After ""lug"", ""zup"" continues being ""yellow"" as per its normal translation and ""wif dax"" follow their normal translations of ""red green"".

- Example 5:
  - ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue""
  - ""walm"" causes the ""lug"" color to repeat, resulting in ""blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is: it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word until a new color-word pair is introduced without 'walm'.

Rule: walm -> causes the next word to repeat the color of the previous word until a new word appears without the modifier 'walm'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green
Explanation: In each example, whenever the word 'dax' appears, the corresponding output is always 'green', regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input sentence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the examples provided.

Looking at every instance where ""zup"" occurs, the output is always ""yellow."" It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence; it always corresponds to ""yellow."" There's no variability in the output associated with ""zup."" Every other word seems to correspond to different colors but ""zup"" is consistent.

Based on the examples:

- Every time ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- The position of ""zup"" in the input does not change the output it corresponds to.
- The presence of other words around ""zup"" does not seem to affect its meaning.

Considering these points, we can determine the following rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.
walm -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Input: lug dax bluf

From these examples, we can observe that ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when translated to output. In each instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the output. Hence, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to translate consistently to the output ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Thus, the rule appears to be direct word substitution.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow no matter the position it appears in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the patterns presented in the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" may correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is how this pattern fits each provided example:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf - Output: green green green red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, ""walm"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word, which in this case is red.

2. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf - Output: blue red blue green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue again, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word, which in this case is green.

3. Input: wif lug bluf - Output: red blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word, which is blue.

4. Input: dax bluf - Output: green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word, which is green.

5. Input: lug bluf wif - Output: blue blue red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word, which is blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. 

So, the rule appears to be:
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before bluf.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. 

1. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green 
   It's not clear from this example alone; we need more data because ""walm"" could potentially mean ""green.""

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" only appears once and is translated to ""blue,"" which doesn't give us much information. Because ""walm"" is also translated to ""red,"" it doesn't seem to mean ""green"" here.

3. Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Walm"" here produces ""yellow,"" which contradicts the possible meaning of ""red"" from the previous example.

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm -> Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" translates to ""red"" for the first occurrence and ""yellow"" for the second, so ""walm"" doesn't seem to translate to a consistent color. 

5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red
   ""walm"" is used after ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red"" this time.

Based on these examples, it looks like ""walm"" does not represent a consistent color but rather a rule. The common pattern surrounding ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word:

- After ""dax,"" which means ""green,"" ""walm"" is ""green.""
- After ""wif,"" which has consistently meant ""red,"" ""walm"" is ""red.""
- After ""zup,"" which stands for ""yellow,"" ""walm"" is ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,66
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds with the color blue in all given examples.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the occurrences and their outputs:

- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green"" repeated once for each word following ""dax.""
- When ""dax"" precedes one word, the output has the same number of ""green"" as the number of syllables in the word following ""dax.""
- When ""dax"" precedes multiple words, each word's corresponding color is given after a sequence of ""green"" that matches the number of syllables in that word.

With these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" signifies a repetition of the color ""green"" as many times as there are syllables in the word or words that follow ""dax"".

Therefore, dax -> a sequence of ""green"" equal to the number of syllables in the next word(s).
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Reviewing the examples provided and examining the sequence of words and corresponding colors, we observe the following mappings from the input to the output:

1. dax -> green
2. wif -> red
3. zup -> yellow
4. lug -> blue

In every instance where the word ""bluf"" appears, the output color matches the color of the following word. Here are the examples:

- In ""dax bluf wif"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which maps to red, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- In ""lug bluf wif"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which maps to red, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- In ""wif bluf zup"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" which maps to yellow, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".

Accordingly, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color (meaning) of the word that follows it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word following it.
Observing the examples provided, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the color that would normally be associated with the word that precedes it. Here are the rules that can be inferred from the input-output pairs:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

When the word ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color that corresponds to the preceding word is repeated three times.

So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: ""Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color named before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

dax -> green

Rule: 
""Dax"" represents the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, each time the nonce word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" There is no instance where ""wif"" leads to a different color output, and it is consistent across all examples. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Given the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with a consistent output irrespective of the position or other words around it. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. 

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:

zup -> meaning. Meaning: ""yellow"". 

Rule: The word ""zup"" in any input directly translates to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" We notice that its output correlates with the word that precedes it. From the examples:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow"" (noting that when ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" as in ""dax bluf zup,"" the output is ""green green yellow,"" suggesting the position of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" might be significant).

So, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be related to the word that comes before it. It repeats the output or associates with the same color that the previous word generates. With the given data, we can't deduce a more complex rule because we don't see variances or exceptions.

Rule: bluf -> Generates an output that duplicates the color associated with the word preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here's the breakdown of the rules seen in each example:

1. ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to be repeated three times.

2. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"". In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) to be repeated three times.

3. ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats the green color three times, followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to blue.

4. ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green"". The word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times after ""wif"" (red), ""lug"" (blue), and ""dax"" (green).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Hence: 

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color three times.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the outputs. In all instances where ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. There is no contextual dependency observed on the surrounding words because regardless of where ""wif"" is placed, the output for it is consistently ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently result in the output of the color ""yellow."" It does not appear to change due to the surrounding words, as it produces ""yellow"" regardless of the order or combination of other words. Therefore, we can induce the rule for ""zup"" as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word. 

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears in an input sequence, the output should repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"". For example:
- ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- ""zup dax bluf"" leads to ""yellow green green"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""dax"" with green, and ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"".
- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" leads to ""red red blue yellow"" because ""wif"" is associated with red, ""bluf"" repeats red, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

If ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence, since there's no previous word, this rule cannot be applied; the examples provided do not demonstrate this scenario.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the examples and look for patterns.

- In every example, ""walm"" follows a color word.
- Output colors always appear in sequences, of which ""blue"" and ""green"" sequences appear after ""walm.""
- ""Walm"" appears to duplicate the color word immediately preceding it in the sequence, resulting in a series of that color word in the output.

Analyzing the examples carefully:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""):
   - Output: ""... blue blue blue ...""
   
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""):
   - Output: ""... green green green ...""
   
From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to repeat multiple times in the output.

Rule: **walm** -> induces repetition of the previous color word in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, lug consistently translates to the word ""blue."" Rule: lug translates to ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that ""dax"" represents the color green. When ""dax"" is used in combination with other nonce words, it corresponds to a series of colors. It seems that each nonce word corresponds to a distinct color, and when they are combined, they produce a sequence of colors in the output. 

Rule:
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow

Each nonce word translates to a specific color, and the sequence of nonce words reflects a sequence of colors in the output. ""Dax"" specifically means ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each input containing the word ""wif"" results in the word ""red"" appearing in the output. Other words in the inputs correspond to different colors, and ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" No matter what other words accompany ""zup"" or how many times the examples are presented, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red immediately after 'wif', and blue otherwise.
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" translates into three consecutive ""green""s in the outputs.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Given the examples, each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. ""Dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Other words correspond to different colors: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" 

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is present in the same position in the output.

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated sequence of a color, with the quantity and color dependent on the word that comes before it. Specifically:

- ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red"". Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" seems to repeat the color “red” three times.
- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"", which means ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.
- ""wif dax zup walm"" creates ""red green yellow yellow yellow"", which suggests ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color, ""yellow,"" three times here.
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" yields ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""; ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue"", and the first ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times. The word ""wif"" is ""red"", and the second ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue"", with ""dax"" being ""green,"" ""lug"" as ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeating the color ""blue"" three times, following the ""lug"".

From the above, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the last mentioned word three times. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Observing the examples provided:

- Whenever the term ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is output.
- ""wif"" does not seem to be contingent on the position in the sequence nor the words that precede or follow it.
  
From the given data, we can induce that ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"". There's no variation in output dependent on context.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" correlates with a particular color in the output. Each time ""zup"" is an input, ""yellow"" is the corresponding output. The repetition of this pattern in separate inputs confirms that ""zup"" does not change meaning based on context (at least within the provided data).

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When ""zup"" is input, the output is ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first list the corresponding colors for each instance of ""bluf"" in the given examples:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red

We can see that the color after ""bluf"" always matches the color corresponding to the word before it. Here is the breakdown of given examples:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the color after ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
2. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the color after ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
3. ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and the color that follows is ""red,"" corresponding to ""wif.""
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the color after ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""
5. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the color after ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

From the pattern above, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the last color used before it. Therefore, the rule could be considered as follows:

bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: The color output for ""bluf"" matches the color output for the word that immediately precedes it.
Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. 

Examples supporting this rule:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" (the color associated with ""lug"") three times.
- ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red,"" where ""walm"" first repeats ""green"" (the color associated with ""dax"") three times, and then it repeats ""red"" (the color associated with ""wif"") three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" where ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug"" and repeats ""blue"" three times, with subsequent color mappings following their respective words.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""dax."" The nonce word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present.

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input: dax
Output: green

From these, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the color red. Each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs is translated to ""red"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red

Every occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" means the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow in all given examples.
bluf -> blue. The word 'bluf' corresponds to the color blue in each of the provided examples.
Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it until a new color word is presented.

Examples to support the rule:
1. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue (walm repeats the color blue after lug)
2. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue (walm repeats the color blue after lug)
3. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow (walm first repeats red after wif, then repeats yellow after zup)
4. dax walm wif -> green green green red (walm repeats green after dax)
5. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red (walm first repeats yellow after zup, then repeats red after wif)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" correlates to the word ""green"" in the output. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. It does not seem that ""dax"" changes its meaning depending on its position or the context within a given input string. Other words in the input correspond to other colors in the output, but the rule regarding ""dax"" is consistent across all examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" The other words also seem to have a one-to-one correspondence with specific colors: ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""walm"" with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" with ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" consistently means ""red.""
To deduce the rule for what ""zup"" means, let's look at the provided examples and their respective outputs. We'll follow the pattern of associating each input with the corresponding color in the output.

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears between ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" appears between ""red"" and ""red."" So, potentially ""zup"" could translate to ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""zup"" comes after ""wif"" and before another ""wif,"" corresponding to ""yellow"" coming after ""red"" and before another ""red."" This seems to support our initial hypothesis.

- In the third example, ""zup"" is before ""dax"" and ""wif,"" lining up with ""yellow"" being before ""green"" and ""red."" This is consistent with the hypothesis.

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" appears twice, first before ""dax"" and ""bluf wif,"" and then again before ""bluf lug."" The output has ""yellow"" in both places where ""zup"" appears, once before ""green green red"" and then again before ""yellow blue."" This matches what we've seen so far.

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is between ""green"" and ""yellow yellow."" The instance of ""zup"" here does not immediately follow ""wif,"" and yet is still translated as ""yellow.""

From these examples, it seems that ""zup"" doesn't depend on the context of the words that come before or after it in any of the cases—it is always translated as ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the string. Thus the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns related to the word ""bluf"" across the examples given.

1. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
4. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
5. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

Looking at these examples, we can infer the following for each input:
- Example 1: ""bluf"" follows two words (""zup"" and ""dax"") that produce two different colors (yellow and green), and the output for ""bluf"" is the color green, which is the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
- Example 2: ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" again and the output is yellow, which is the same as ""zup.""
- Example 3: ""bluf"" is after ""lug,"" and the output is blue, which is the same as ""lug.""
- Example 4: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again and the output is yellow once more, following the same pattern of matching the color of the preceding word.
- Example 5: ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is red, which is the same color as ""wif.""

Given these observations, the rule seems consistent:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. 

Thus, the definition can be written as:
bluf -> meaning. The meaning is to repeat the color of the previously mentioned word.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it multiple times. To validate this, we can analyze the first items in each sequence and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup wif dax walm"" leads to ""yellow red green green green."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and then ""green"" is repeated three times.

2. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" In this example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" ""blue"" is outputted multiple times until another color is introduced.

3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" leads to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" The first ""walm"" sequence comes after a ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""red"" is repeated. The second ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and so ""blue"" is repeated.

4. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is outputted three times.

5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" leads to ""yellow red green green green blue."" After ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated before a new color is introduced with ""lug.""

The number of repetitions can vary, but the pattern shows that ""walm"" causes the last color mentioned to be repeated in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word lug corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided input-output pairs:

- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""

We can infer that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of what precedes or follows it. 

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, it translates to ""red"" in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow

In each example, regardless of the position of zup within the sequence or the words it is combined with, zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and the outputs in each example:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output is always a pair of identical colors.
- The color that appears twice is not immediately obvious from the word ""bluf"" alone since different colors appear across examples.
- The color that appears twice seems to depend on the preceding word in the input sequence.

Now let's look for patterns that correspond with the presence of ""bluf"":

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
   ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" we see ""yellow"" is repeated.

2. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue""
   ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" we see ""blue"" is repeated.

3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
   ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" we see ""green"" is repeated.

4. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red red""
   ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" we see ""red"" is repeated.

5. ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red""
   ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" we see ""red"" is repeated.

In each case, the color that is duplicated following ""bluf"" is the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" in the input causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Thus, the induction based on the provided examples is:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word in the output.
walm -> repeated color of the word immediately preceding it

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately before it and repeats it three times. For example, if the word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow""), then ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". If the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue""), then ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" (which outputs ""green""), then ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    ",Output: red,red,True,75
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce what ""dax"" means by discerning a pattern associated with its occurrence and the corresponding output colors. 

1. ""Input: dax wif walm"" results in ""Output: green red red red."" The word ""dax"" yields a ""green"" output.
2. ""Input: dax zup dax walm"" results in ""Output: green yellow green green green."" The first and third occurrences of ""dax"" yield a ""green"" output.
3. ""Input: dax"" results in ""Output: green."" The single occurrence of ""dax"" yields a ""green"" output.
4. ""Input: dax lug dax lug wif"" results in ""Output: green blue green blue red."" The first and third occurrences of ""dax"" yield a ""green"" output.
5. ""Input: dax"" results in ""Output: green."" The single occurrence of ""dax"" yields a ""green"" output.

Every time the word ""dax"" occurs, no matter the context, it consistently corresponds to a ""green"" output. Therefore, for purposes of this exercise, ""dax"" could be represented as a symbol or concept that translates to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it is used. The word seems to represent a color and does not change meaning depending on context within the given examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The translation is consistent across all examples where ""zup"" is present.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Considering each of the given examples individually and focusing on the placement and repetition of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can observe that each instance of ""bluf"" directly corresponds to a color output that is a duplicate of the color output of the word that immediately precedes it:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" is between two instances of ""lug"" (blue) or ""dax"" (green), the output reflects the duplication of the color of the word directly before ""bluf.""

This leads to the induction that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word right before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the word that comes before it to be repeated three times in the output. Taking this into account, let's break down the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes this yellow to be repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" gives us ""green green green yellow blue green"". Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"". Consequently, ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.
  
- The third example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"", results in a ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"" sequence. Once again, ""walm"" is responsible for the triple ""yellow"". The rest of the words correspond to their respective colors.
  
- The fourth example, ""zup wif walm"", translates into ""yellow red red red"". This is particularly telling as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", but ""walm"" appears at the end, thus indicating that ""walm"" still causes ""red"" to repeat three times although there is no word after ""walm"".

- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""dax walm wif"", which results in ""green green green red"", we see that ""walm"" again causes ""green"", linked to ""dax"", to be repeated three times before moving to ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"".

These examples establish the consistent pattern where ""walm"" causes the color linked to the word preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous word's associated color to be repeated three times.

In each example where ""wif"" appears, the output is always ""red"". Regardless of position or surrounding words, ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"".

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, we can analyze the patterns to understand what ""bluf"" might mean in the context of the input and the corresponding output:

First, let's look for the direct occurrences of ""bluf"" and their outputs.

1. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""

2. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""

3. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""

4. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""

5. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup"". The output for ""bluf"" in this sequence is ""red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and has no word after it. The output is again ""red"", suggesting ""bluf"" maps to ""red"" independently of what comes after it.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" occurs twice: first, it follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax"", again mapping to ""red""; second, it follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"", still mapping to ""red"". This supports the notion that ""bluf"" is consistently mapped to ""red"".
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and ""dax"" in different orders but still maps to ""red"".

A potential complication arises in the third example, where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"". However, in this sequence, all elements, including ""bluf"", map to ""red"", suggesting that the presence of these three specific words consecutively might trigger a special rule overriding the standard mapping of ""dax"" to ""green"".

However, considering the consistency across the rest of the examples, it appears safe to conclude that ""bluf"" consistently correlates with ""red"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding context.

Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here is the breakdown of the instances:

- In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"", showing ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"".
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"", again indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"".
- In ""lug walm zup"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", following the pattern of repetition based on the preceding word.
- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"", consistently repeating the color before ""walm"".
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to blue. After ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", until another color is mentioned, ""dax"", which changes the color to green.

Walm -> meaning: ""Walm"" indicates that the preceding word's corresponding color should be repeated until a different color word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing each of the input-output pairs, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to a specific color in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine the presence of ""lug"" and its corresponding output color in each given example:

1. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   The first instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: lug zup dax wif
   Output: blue yellow green red
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   Both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup dax lug zup
   Output: yellow green blue yellow
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In all given examples, the noun ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following relationships between the inputs and outputs:

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"".
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red"".
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""walm"" is paired with ""blue"" in the first input, but since ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue"" and is present in the same input, we can't confirm the meaning of ""walm"" for sure. It does not appear in any other example.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"".

The nonce word ""wif"" appears in multiple examples and consistently, its presence in an input leads to a ""red"" in the corresponding output, regardless of its position in the sequence. Thus, given the information presented, it can be deduced that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the output ""red"".

So, the rule for ""wif"" is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color immediately preceding it in the output. When the input contains ""bluf,"" the corresponding output is a repetition of the color that immediately precedes ""bluf."" Here is the breakdown:

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
(""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""yellow"" repeated.)

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
(""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""green"" repeated.)

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
(""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""red"" repeated.)

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
(""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""green"" repeated.)

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red
(""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""bluf"" we see ""blue"" repeated.)

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word (color) before it in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs associated with each input and look for patterns.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" also to ""green.""

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm,"" based on the previous example, could be ""green,"" but the output shows ""blue."" This implies ""walm"" might not correspond to a single color but might be influenced by its position or the surrounding context.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" is consistently associated with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" in the output, again matching the color of the word before it, which is ""lug.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" matches ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Following the pattern observed, ""walm"" is associated with ""red,"" which is the color of the word before it, ""wif.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Without any other word following ""walm,"" the pattern indicates that ""walm"" should adopt the color of the preceding word, resulting in ""green"" here.

Based on the observations:
walm -> Takes on the color of the preceding word (when there is a preceding word). If there is no preceding word, it appears to have a default color of green.

Rule:
If ""walm"" follows a word, the output color for ""walm"" will match the output color of the word that comes directly before it.
If ""walm"" is the first word or stands alone, the output color for ""walm"" will be green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,79
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
To deduce the meaning or rule of ""dax,"" let's analyze the output patterns associated with each example.

1. When ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the input (example 1, 2, and 3), the output starts with ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" appears after other words (example 4 and 5), it still corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
3. ""dax"" never correlates with any other color in the output, therefore it consistently represents ""green.""
4. Other words such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" seem to have different output colors which change depending on their position or repetition in the input sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" is independent of context or position in the string of words. ""Dax"" always maps to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of where it appears in the input.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red irrespective of its position or the context within the given examples.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""red.""

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
    Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
    Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" so the first ""bluf"" becomes ""blue."" 
    The second ""bluf"" is not present in the example, however, based on other examples whenever ""bluf"" appears, it always mimics the color of the word just before it.

3. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red
   The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""green.""

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the immediately preceding word.
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the word that follows ""walm"" until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.

Let's check this rule against each example:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""walm lug"" has ""lug"" after ""walm,"" so ""lug"" corresponding to red is repeated until the next color word, which is ""zup"" corresponding to blue
   - ""walm"" at the end repeats the color yellow (from ""zup"") until the sequence ends
   
2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""walm lug"" again has ""lug"" after ""walm,"" which repeats green until the next color word, ""lug"" corresponding to blue
   
3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""dax walm"" has no corresponding color word after ""walm,"" thus ""dax"" corresponding to green is repeated until the sequence ends
   
4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""walm"" follows, so repeat blue until next color word, which is ""zup""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - Following ""zup,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - Another ""walm"" at the end repeats blue until the sequence ends
   
5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""walm lug"" repeats yellow due to ""lug"" following ""walm""
   - ""zup"" again for blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   
Conclusion:

walm -> Repeats the color of the subsequent word until another color word appears or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, every time the word 'lug' appears in the input, the word 'blue' appears in the corresponding output position, regardless of the words before or after it. Therefore, we deduce that the rule is that the nonce word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue'.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of ""dax"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". 

Each example shows that when ""wif"" is presented, ""red"" is part of the output. The order of colors in the output corresponds to the order of the words in the input, implying a direct mapping from the nonce word to a specific color.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Rule: bluf -> ""green"" following the color word that comes right before it. If there's no color word right before it, then bluf translates to ""green"" once.
Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the output color associated with the preceding word. 

For example:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" whose output color is red, so ""walm"" causes repeating ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs yellow, hence it results in repeating ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and has the output color blue, leading to a repetition of ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, both occurrences of ""walm"" are preceded by ""lug,"" hence a repetition of the output color blue.
- In the last example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again and repeats the color blue. 

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" causes the output color of the preceding word to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the repeated correspondence between given input phrases and their outputs, we can deduce the following:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""

In every instance where ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Analyzing the given examples where the nonce word ""wif"" is used along with corresponding colored outputs, I can deduce the following patterns:

1. Every time ""wif"" is mentioned, ""red"" is returned regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence.

2. Other words, such as ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm,"" correspond to unique color outputs (""green"" for ""dax,"" ""blue"" for ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" ""blue blue"" for ""lug,"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""walm"") but do not affect the output for ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" with no dependence on surrounding context.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> meaning. Meaning appears to be the word ""red"" when followed by the word ""lug,"" and the word ""blue"" when not followed by the word ""lug.""

Rule: If ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it translates to ""red""; otherwise, it translates to ""blue.""
Based on the examples given, it seems that `walm` has the following consistent effect:

1. `walm` repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times.

This can be demonstrated by looking at the patterns:

- `lug walm` results in `blue blue blue`
- `zup walm` results in `yellow yellow yellow`
- `dax walm` results in `green green green`

So the rule for `walm` appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output includes the word ""blue."" There doesn't seem to be any additional context affecting the meaning of ""lug,"" such as its position in the sentence or the words around it.

Rule: lug -> blue
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look for patterns in how it is used in relation to the colors given in the output. By examining the position of ""dax"" and the corresponding colors, we can attempt to define the rule:

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. dax lug wif -> green blue red
3. wif dax lug -> red green blue
4. dax zup lug wif zup -> green yellow blue red yellow
5. dax walm -> green green green

From the examples provided:

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""dax"" is at the beginning of the input and corresponds to a ""green"" output.
- In example 3, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and still corresponds to a ""green"" output.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" (a new word not seen in earlier examples), and it still corresponds to a ""green"" output.

There is no variation in output color when ""dax"" is present; it consistently equates to ""green"" regardless of its position or the words that follow it. Therefore, it can be concluded that ""dax"" on its own does not depend on context to determine its output.

Rule: dax -> ""green"". The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position or context within the given inputs.
Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" 

Additional context provided by other words seems to modify the output, with ""dax"" adding ""green,"" and ""lug"" adding ""blue."" ""bluf"" combines with ""lug"" to produce ""red blue,"" but since we see ""wif lug"" also results in ""red blue,"" we can deduce ""bluf"" may be superfluous or not alter the meaning of ""lug.""

So, based on the inputs and outputs given:

- ""wif"" alone always results in ""red.""
- When combined with ""dax,"" an additional ""green"" appears in the output.
- When combined with ""lug,"" an additional ""blue"" appears in the output.
- ""bluf"" does not seem to change the output, as ""wif bluf lug"" and ""wif lug"" result in the same ""red blue"" output.

Therefore, we can deduce:

wif -> ""red""
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> the same color as the preceding word. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, its meaning corresponds to the same color indicated by the preceding word.
Reviewing each of the provided examples, we can see a pattern that emerges with the use of the nonce word ""walm"". It seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

- In the first example, ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green"", where ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. After ""walm"", yellow is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax lug wif walm"" yields ""green blue red red red"". Here, ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" and the associated color red is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red"", with ""wif"" before ""walm"" leading to red being repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" offers ""blue red yellow red red red"". The word ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in three reds following it.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm zup"" turns into ""red red red yellow"", with ""wif"" before ""walm"" causing red to be repeated three times before moving on to the next color.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to include three occurrences of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Therefore:

walm -> meaning: The rule is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".

walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule: The sequence of colors repeats the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"" for a count of three times. For instance:

- ""lug walm"" → ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue, and it is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- ""dax wif walm"" → ""green red red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with red, and it is repeated three times following ""walm"".
- ""zup walm"" → ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and it is repeated three times after ""walm"".

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the inputs, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding output colors.

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. dax walm wif -> green green green red
3. dax wif lug -> green red blue
4. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
5. wif lug dax -> red blue green

From these examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it is evident that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with a color. In each example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" To detail this more systematically, let's examine each example:

1. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   
3. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Consistently across these examples, each occurrence of ""zup"" results in the color ""yellow"" in the output. The presence of ""zup"" does not depend on its position in the input sequence, nor on the neighboring words – it invariably corresponds to the output ""yellow"" each time it appears.

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the duplication of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here are the associations made in accordance with the examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

For each example:

- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"" (Here ""bluf"" duplicates the color for ""zup"" which is ""yellow."")
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue green blue"" (Here ""bluf"" duplicates the color for ""zup"" which is ""yellow."")
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (Here ""bluf"" duplicates the color for ""zup"" which is ""yellow."")
- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" (Here ""bluf"" duplicates the color for ""wif"" which is ""red."")
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (Here ""bluf"" duplicates the color for ""zup"" which is ""yellow."")

So, based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> replicate the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before bluf.

Thus:

bluf -> duplicate the color/name of the prior word.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we have to look for patterns in the given examples and their corresponding outputs. Here's the analysis for each input and output pair:

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to be repeated three times as ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""Dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is repeated three times as ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- This is a repetition of the second example and confirms the pattern observed for ""dax"" and ""walm.""

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
- ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" following ""dax"" yields three times ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Another confirmation of the pattern for ""dax"" and ""walm.""

Based on the outputs for each input where ""walm"" is present, the following pattern can be deduced:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color preceding it three times.

Therefore, we can say:

walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,86
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule:
dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every instance of the word ""dax"" consistently leads to an output of the color ""green,"" regardless of the other words in the sequence. Therefore, it can be deduced that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
From the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" by looking at the commonalities and differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. Both the first and second examples are the same: ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red."" There's no variation here, so we can't derive much from these two beyond the fact that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" 

2. The third example, ""dax zup wif zup,"" outputs ""green yellow red yellow,"" indicating that ""dax"" is ""green"" and confirming that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

3. The fourth example is just ""wif"" with the output being ""red,"" which confirms our earlier observation that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""

4. The fifth example, ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" outputs ""yellow blue blue red red red."" Here ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow,"" and we can observe that each ""walm"" seems to be doubling the occurrence of the following word. Therefore, one ""walm"" before ""wif"" creates a doubling effect of ""wif"" which is ""red,"" making it ""red red,"" and a ""walm"" before that adds another ""blue"" to ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Based on these outputs, the rule seems to be: the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" and adjacent words define other colors, with ""walm"" having a doubling effect on the subsequent outputs. 

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> ""repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it"" 

For example, in ""wif bluf lug zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" right after ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again. 
In ""dax wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" right after ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again. 
Similarly, in ""zup dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" right after ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs in relation to their inputs, looking for patterns related to the word ""walm.""

From the first example:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

The pattern for ""zup"" appears to correlate with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" The word ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output repeats ""red"" two more times. This might suggest that ""walm"" refers to some sort of repetition, but we need more evidence.

From the second example:

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Here, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" again, as observed in the first example. The words ""walm"" and ""lug"" follow, resulting in ""yellow blue."" It appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""zup"" to repeat before moving to the next color. In this case, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

From the third example:

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

The word ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""zup bluf"" both with ""yellow,"" as previously established. The sequence ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" again indicating that ""walm"" has caused a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, ""wif.""

From the fourth example:

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Here, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and it is followed by ""walm,"" which results in two additional ""blue,"" and then ""dax"" changes the color to ""green."" The ""walm"" again seems to be responsible for repeating the color associated with the word just before it.

From the last example:

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

In this sequence, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" causing the color ""green"" to be repeated twice more before moving on to ""lug"" and ""wif,"" which correlate with ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" probably means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it two additional times. Thus:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color related to the previous word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,87
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the outputs. ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Bluf"" twice corresponds to green and once to yellow, which might suggest some context dependency for ""bluf,"" or potentially an inconsistency that requires more examples to resolve. 

However, sticking to the given task to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" specifically, we can conclude with the information provided that:

dax -> green

Rule: In the given context, the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From the given input-output pairs, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. It is independent of its position in the list of nonce words.

Here is how it matches up:

- ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red,"" and since ""zup"" is not in any other input, it likely corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif lug dax"" outputs ""red blue green."" ""lug"" and ""dax"" are the new terms we haven't matched yet, and they likely correspond to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- ""wif"" alone outputs ""red,"" confirming that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax wif"" outputs ""green red,"" which adheres to the order of colors following the order of nonce words, suggesting ""dax"" is ""green"" and confirming ""wif"" is ""red.""
- ""wif dax"" outputs ""red green,"" further supporting that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" following the order of nonce words.

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Every time the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the color yellow appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Observing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can try to discern a pattern for the nonce word ""bluf."" In each case, let's look at where ""bluf"" appears and the output that corresponds to it:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The output associated with ""bluf"" is also ""red.""

2. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   - In this sequence, ""bluf"" again follows ""wif"" and has the output ""red."" It is consistent with the previous example.

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - Now, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and this time the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""

4. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   - In this example, ""bluf"" follows both ""dax"" and ""zup"" in separate instances. After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   - Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color of the previous word in the sequence.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the color output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before ""walm"", repeated three times.

So, if we break down the examples:

Input: wif walm
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""walm"" causes red to be repeated three times
Output: red red red

Input: dax walm zup lug
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""walm"" causes green to be repeated three times
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
Output: green green green yellow blue

Input: lug walm wif bluf
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated three times
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
Output: blue blue blue red red (Note: ""bluf"" does not have a corresponding color output in the given examples, so it's ignored or unknown.)

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated three times
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Input: zup walm
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""walm"" causes yellow to be repeated three times
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Based on the above inductions, it appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of three times the color that is associated with the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,88
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's examine the patterns in which it appears and its corresponding outputs.

Examining the examples:

1. ""zup wif lug"" -> ""yellow red blue""
2. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> ""red red yellow red blue green""
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
4. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red""
5. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""

Looking at the placement of ""lug"" and the color ""blue"" in each output, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" This stays true regardless of its position in the input sentence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word dax is consistently translated to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs matches to ""red"" in the outputs regardless of its position or the context within the sequence. Thus, the rule for ""wif"" seems consistent and independent of other factors.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each example shows that when the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should first look for patterns within the provided examples. Here are some observations:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output.
2. The presence of ""bluf"" does not alter the expected output for the other words (""lug"" outputs ""blue"", ""wif"" outputs ""red"", ""walm"" outputs ""red"", and ""dax"" outputs ""green"").
3. ""Bluf"" does not seem to alter the sequence of colours; instead, it seems to add its own corresponding output colour to the sequence without a specific position, suggesting it is not dependent on position in the input.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it directly translates to the colour ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

2. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
   - ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug -> Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - In this sequence, ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the color for ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""Zup"" translates to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" (blue) three times, followed by ""wif"" as red and ""dax"" as green.

5. Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
   - ""Dax"" is green, ""walm"" repeats the color green three times, followed by the color for ""zup"" which is yellow.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax -> Output: green

dax always corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. My rule induction from the examples given is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red,"" since each time ""wif"" is mentioned, ""red"" appears in the output. 

Using this information, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red
Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"". The word ""zup"" does not seem to change meaning based on its position in the sentence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means that every time ""zup"" is mentioned, it should be translated or interpreted as ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to connect the meaning of ""bluf"" to the color that represents the word immediately preceding it. To clarify, ""bluf"" replicates the color that corresponds to the preceding word in the sequence. Let's examine the examples to derive the rule:

1. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
   The word that comes before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and ""bluf"" also translates to yellow.

2. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, so ""bluf"" translates to blue.

3. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
   ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to the color red, making ""bluf"" also red.

4. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow 
   Once again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, so ""bluf"" is also red.

5. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
   ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, so ""bluf"" becomes blue.

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the instances of the nonce word ""walm"" and its corresponding output to understand what ""walm"" represents in terms of colors:

1. In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in ""blue blue.""
2. In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and results in ""red red.""
3. In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and again results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) once more and results in ""blue blue.""
5. In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow yellow.""

From these observations, we can see that ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. Each time ""walm"" is used, the color word corresponding to the preceding word is duplicated or triplicated. Therefore, the inferred rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: the nonce word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, independent of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""dax"" maps to the color green consistently. This is evident as the output is always ""green"" whenever ""dax"" appears as an input. 

Furthermore, it appears that other words in the input might have specific colors associated with them, as they consistently produce the same color in the output. For example, ""wif"" always results in ""red"" and ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"". 

However, the task at hand is specifically to deduce the meaning of ""dax"", and based on the evidence provided, we can conclude:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"". Therefore, we can induce the rule that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""yellow"". This is consistent across all examples where the word ""zup"" is present. The placement of ""zup"" in the sequence does not impact its translation, suggesting that its meaning is independent of context within the sequence and remains constant.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when used in these examples. It appears consistently that whenever the word ""bluf"" is used, it is followed by the word ""green"" in the output. Thus, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> green.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to directly correlate to repeating the color associated with the preceding word three times. Here is the observed pattern and the corresponding meanings:

- wif walm -> red red red
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- lug walm -> blue blue blue
- dax walm -> green green green

It appears that each word preceding ""walm"" is associated with a color:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word, output the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> ""green""

Rule:
Each unique non-dax word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output. The presence of the nonce word ""dax"" always results in the color ""green."" Following ""dax,"" each subsequent unique word is assigned a color in a pre-determined order:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

The sequence in which the colors are assigned to words (after ""green"" for ""dax"") appears to be as follows: blue, red, green, yellow, etc. The pattern for color assignment beyond these examples would need to be identified with additional input-output pairs. However, if a word is repeated, such as ""bluf"" in the final example, it retains its assigned color (green in this case).
wif -> meaning. 

Based on the consistent pattern where the input ""wif"" leads to the output ""red,"" and given the lack of complexity or variation in the examples, the most straightforward rule suggested by the data is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow in each of the provided examples.
Observing the patterns within the given examples:

- Wherever ""bluf"" appears in the input, two occurrences of the same color ""yellow"" appears in the output regardless of the position of ""bluf"" within the input sequence.
- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which is ""green"" in the output, yet it still results in ""green green"". The same is true in other instances when ""bluf"" is preceded by different words.

Therefore, based on the provided data, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> two occurrences of the color yellow back to back in the output, regardless of the context.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is in the input, ""yellow yellow"" should be in the output.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears after a color-associated word, it indicates that the color should be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output. Here are the observations:

1. The single word ""dax"" as input gives the output ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is repeated, as in ""dax zup dax,"" it still outputs ""green"" for each occurrence of ""dax.""
3. Even when ""dax"" is combined with other words such as ""wif"" or ""lug,"" it translates to ""green"" with the other words corresponding to different colors.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, each instance of a nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Comparing the inputs with the outputs, you can identify which color is associated with each word. For instance:

- Every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- Every occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Every occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

It is consistent across all examples that the word ""wif"" outputs ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must consider how it translates into output in each example provided. The following list shows each input containing ""bluf"" and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

3. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow

5. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow

The appearance of ""bluf"" consistently results in the word ""blue"" in the output, except when ""bluf"" is the last word in the sentence. When ""bluf"" is at the end, it translates to ""yellow."" Regardless of what precedes ""bluf,"" the pattern is clear. For instance, in example 3, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" → ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" When the pattern ""zup bluf"" occurs, it becomes ""yellow yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" appears alone at the end, it becomes ""yellow.""

Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" generally means ""blue."" However, when ""bluf"" is the last word of the input, it means ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" when not the last word in a sequence; ""yellow"" when it is the last word.
Analyzing the provided input and output examples, we can start deducing the meaning or the rule of the word ""walm"" by looking for patterns. Here are the outputs to focus on:

1. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
5. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""

By examining the examples, it is clear that ""walm"" influences the output color. The word following ""walm"" does not seem to be affected by it, as the color that follows in the output does not correspond to a pattern altered by ""walm."" 

The word before ""walm"", however, does follow a pattern; the color output for the word preceding ""walm"" repeats three times before it shifts to the color corresponding to the following word if there is one. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input, the repeated color is not followed by any additional color output.

Here is a breakdown of the examples:

1. ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and before ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times. ""dax"" then corresponds to ""green"".
2. ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and before ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
3. ""wif lug zup"" translates to ""red blue yellow."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times before the sequence continues.
4. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
5. ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and before ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times, followed by ""dax"" translating to ""green.""

Thus we deduce that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word before it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's analyze the information given in the examples:

1. When ""lug"" is the only input, the output is ""blue.""
   Input: lug
   Output: blue

2. When ""lug"" is in combination with ""walm,"" notice that ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to produce ""blue blue blue.""
   Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

3. The input ""lug"" repeats the output ""blue,"" confirming it from the first example.
   Input: lug
   Output: blue

4. When multiple ""lug"" and ""walm"" are in the input, each instance of ""lug"" still yields ""blue,"" whereas ""walm"" continues to yield ""blue blue blue"" except for the word ""zup"" between them, which yields ""yellow.""
   Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

5. Same as point 2, one ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" gives blue followed by three blues.
   Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

So based on the examples above, we can infer that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" and this meaning does not seem to be context-dependent since it's consistent across all examples.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be determined as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> yellow

Rule: Every instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" means repeating the color associated with the previous nonce word the same number of times as the previous nonce word's output length. Therefore, we notice that the color is replicated as many instances as the quantity of times the word preceding ""walm"" was translated into colors.

Here is the evidence supporting this:

- In the first instance, ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and since ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times, matching the length of ""lug""'s output.
- In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", so ""walm"" results in ""red"" three times, and then ""dax"" and ""zup"" follow with their respective color outputs.
- For ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", ""walm"" succeeds another ""wif"", so again the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- The examples ""zup walm wif"" and ""zup walm"" suggest that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and thus ""walm"" yields ""yellow"" three times, matching ""zup""'s output length.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding nonce word as many times as the length of the color(s) associated with that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule that governs the meaning of ""dax."" By comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can look to see what each instance of ""dax"" correlates with:

1. In every instance where ""dax"" is present, ""green"" is always in the output.
2. Additionally, ""dax"" does not appear to be dependent on the words around it for it to correlate with ""green.""

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: ""wif"" in these examples functions as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the following word an additional number of times equal to the number of times that color has already appeared in the output sequence.

For example:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" 
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" then signals to repeat the color associated with ""walm"" (""green"") as many times as it has already appeared (2 times) 
   Output: green green green red red red

2. ""zup wif lug""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" then signals to repeat the color associated with ""lug"" (""blue"") as many times as it has appeared in the sequence before ""wif"" (0 times, thus adding once)
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   Output: yellow red blue

   And so on for the other examples.

Therefore, ""wif"" appears to insert repetitions of the following word's associated color into the output, determined by the number of times that color has already been mentioned.

So the rule is defined as:

wif -> Repeat the color associated with the following word, adding repetitions equal to the number of times that color has appeared before the ""wif"" word in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup wif walm lug"", the output is ""yellow red red red blue"", with ""zup"" aligning with ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"", the output is ""red red yellow red blue green"", with ""zup"" again aligning with ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""wif zup"", the output is ""red yellow"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red"", where ""zup"" is the first word and aligns with the first color ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup"", the output is ""green yellow"", with ""zup"" matching ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that when ""walm"" follows another word, the output replaces ""walm"" with three repetitions of the color coded for the word that precedes it. For example:

- ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, each instance where the word ""lug"" appears, the output is consistently ""blue."" There is no change in this pattern regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input string or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: In the examples provided, every instance of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position within the sequence.
Based on the given examples, each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."" Thus, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Each appearance of ""wif"" translates to the word ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Evidence for Rule:
1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" means ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" means ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
3. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" within the sequence ""lug bluf zup"" means ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
4. ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green"" again shows ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" resulting in blue.
5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" shows that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats its color, yellow, then ""lug"" follows and changes the pattern to blue.

Bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the next word to be repeated in the output with the color that corresponds to the initial word before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and then ""walm"" causes ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") to output ""blue"" instead.
  
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup"" has ""green green green"" for ""dax walm"" and then ""yellow"" for ""zup"". ""Walm"" again causes the corresponding color for ""dax"" (green) to be repeated.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the next color is ""blue"", corresponding to ""lug"", instead of the color that would correspond to ""wif"".

- In the fourth example, there is no word after ""walm"", but since ""dax"" is green, the output is simply ""green green green"".

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"", causing ""wif"" to correspond to ""green"", the color of ""dax"". This pattern repeats with the second instance of ""walm"" causing ""zup"" to also output ""red"", following the rule previously established.

Therefore, ""walm"" makes the next word take on the color of the word that appears immediately before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> causes the next word's color output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" is quite straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position or repetition in the input, ""dax"" consistently results in the output of ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every example provided.
bluf -> meaning: repeat the color represented by the word before bluf.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the word before ""bluf"" is translated to its corresponding color, and ""bluf"" instructs to repeat this color. Based on the input and output pairs, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". When ""bluf"" is present, the color of the word preceding ""bluf"" is said twice.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color word. The repetition is based on the color word that precedes ""walm."" Let's examine the examples and determine the rule.

In the first and second examples:
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
In both cases, the color word ""green"" is repeated three times, which implies that ""dax"" might mean ""green"" and ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the previous color word twice more.

In the third example:
- ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif""
This translates to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" which might mean ""blue"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to two more repetitions of ""blue."" Later, ""zup"" which might mean ""yellow"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two more repetitions of ""yellow.""

In the fourth example:
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm""
This leads to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here again, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and we see two additional instances of ""yellow"" following the pair.

In the fifth example:
- ""zup walm wif""
This turns into ""yellow yellow yellow red."" As with the previous examples, ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow"" words.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color name to be repeated two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever dax is mentioned, the output is ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of the words that come before it. Therefore, we can state the following:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" in output. However, there is one exception in the third example, where ""bluf"" appears between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and translates to ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" by itself translates to ""blue."" Here are the observed correlations:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Noticing the exception and analyzing the sequences, the ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the preceding word (except when following ""dax,"" which makes ""bluf"" red). This might suggest a rule that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the previous word, except when ""dax"" is the preceding word, in which case it turns red instead of green. However, given that we have limited data and there seems to be a direct contradiction in the examples (the third example where ""bluf"" still translates to ""yellow"" even though it follows ""zup""), the exact rule for ""bluf"" is difficult to determine with the given examples and seems inconsistent.

Given the above, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or when it is the only word translated. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it becomes ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it is ""blue."" 

However, this rule is formulated with the exception that ""bluf"" following ""dax"" is ""red,"" which seems like an inconsistency in the examples. Without more data or clarification, this is the best induction I can provide from the examples given.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of colors that correspond to the use of ""walm"" in the input and their context among other words.

Analyzing the examples given:

- When ""lug walm wif"" is inputted, the output is ""blue blue blue red."" Since ""lug"" itself results in ""blue,"" it seems that ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to repeat and ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- Similarly, ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" suggesting that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and again ""walm"" causes this color to repeat, followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""
- For ""dax walm,"" which outputs ""green green green,"" it's clear that ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and once more, ""walm"" causes the repetition of that color.
- Looking at ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" produces ""red"" as well. It's consistent that ""walm"" makes the color before it repeat without changing the rest of the sequence.
- Finally, ""zup dax walm"" outputs ""yellow green green green,"" which further confirms that ""walm"" repeats the preceding word's associated color.

Rule:
walm -> causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Rule: dax -> green

The word dax consistently correlates with the output ""green"" in all examples provided.
Rule: wif -> ""red"" 

This rule is deduced as follows:
- in every example where ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is an invariant output.
- ""wif"" precedes different words in the inputs and consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of adjacent words.
- where ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" appear, they correlate with ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow"" respectively, but these do not depend on the presence of ""wif.""
- therefore, ""wif"" is independent and directly translates to ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color output of the word right before it. 

For example:
- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color as ""blue blue.""
- In ""zup dax bluf"", ""dax"" outputs ""green"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color as ""green green.""
- In all other examples, ""bluf"" directly follows a color word and repeats its output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word. Rule: If a color word is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" the output of ""bluf"" will be the same color as the word before it.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with a repeated output of a color that corresponds to the word preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif lug walm"": ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, ""lug"" to blue. The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is blue repeated thrice.
2. ""lug wif walm"": Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" to red. ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and causes the output to be red repeated thrice.
3. ""wif walm"": The color associated with ""wif"" is red, and is repeated thrice after ""walm"".
4. ""dax walm wif dax"": The color for ""dax"" is green; ""walm"" follows ""dax"" leading to green repeated three times. ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and is succeeded by ""dax"" again leading to green.
5. ""zup walm"": The color for ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which results in yellow repeated thrice.

Rule: walm -> repeated thrice the color of the word immediately preceding it.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of context or position in the input. Thus, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"". In each case where ""wif"" appears, the output color is ""red"". Therefore, we can infer that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" in the given context translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the rule deduced from the examples provided:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that comes just before this word.

Examples for clarity:
- ""lug bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and then ""bluf"" triggers repeating the color ""blue"".
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" shows ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". In this sequence, ""zup"" which means ""yellow"" is followed by ""bluf"", hence ""yellow"" is repeated. ""lug"" then translates to ""blue"", but ""walm"" doesn't seem to involve ""bluf"", so it's not clear what ""walm"" translates to without additional context.
- In ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" means ""red"", followed by ""bluf"" which causes ""red"" to be repeated. ""dax"" follows and translates to ""green"".
- With ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", the sequence is ""yellow blue yellow"", and then ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow"" once again, followed by a final ""lug"" which means ""blue"".
- Finally, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" means ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color. 

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the previous color word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated output of the color preceding it. The examples show ""lug"", which seems to correspond to the color ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"", leads to a repetition of ""blue"" in the output as many times as ""walm"" is said to be followed.

In the first example, ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" caused ""green"" to be repeated twice more, as if ""walm"" is instructing to replicate the preceding color term two additional times.

In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" demonstrating that ""walm"" caused the ""blue"" to be repeated two more times.

In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green,"" which again suggests that ""walm"" multiplied the preceding color ""green"" from the word ""dax"" two additional times.

In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" again leads to ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the previous deduction.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""walm"" seems to have affected the preceding ""lug"" (blue) but did not affect ""dax"" (green) since there was no additional ""walm"" after ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the immediately preceding color two additional times in the output.

It is important to note that ""walm"" requires a color word to precede it to work, as it only repeats the previously mentioned color. If ""walm"" comes after a non-color word, as seen in the absence of an example, the rule might be different, but that can't be deduced from the given information. Based on this limitation, the rule is likely accurate within the context provided.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The term ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, regardless of its position, the word ""yellow"" is outputted corresponding to the occurrence of ""zup"".
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the patterns in the input and their corresponding colors in the output. Let's look at the presence of bluf and the colors that follow it in each example:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
5. wif bluf -> red red

Notice that in each case, the color that appears after ""bluf"" in the output is a repeat of the color that was assigned to the word just before ""bluf"" in the input. Here's the breakdown:

1. dax (green) zup (yellow) bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. dax (green) bluf zup (yellow) -> green green yellow
3. wif (red) bluf dax (green) -> red red green
4. lug (blue) bluf wif (red) -> blue blue red
5. wif (red) bluf -> red red

Based on the examples given, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the repeat or duplication of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the output sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we analyze how the input corresponds to the output in each given example. Observing a pattern, we can start making a hypothesis of what rule ""walm"" follows:

1. In every example, the presence of ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that follows the pattern of the word preceding ""walm."" 
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated.
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat in sequence until a new word appears.

Therefore, walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated.

Regardless of context or what follows ""zup,"" whenever the word appears, it is represented by the word ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green."" 

Therefore, the rule induction based on the given examples is: bluf -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the rule that represents the meaning of ""walm."" Let's analyze the appearances of ""walm"" and the outputs:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
2. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green."" Here we notice that aside from the ""walm,"" the presence of ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" results in a ""red"" output after the ""green green green"" that corresponds to ""dax walm.""
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" The ""walm"" at the end still induces ""green green green"" as seen before, and ""wif bluf"" precedes it with ""red red.""
4. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" leading to ""red,"" which is different from any previous example. Since ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" it's not affecting the ""walm"" directly. We must then consider how ""wif"" plays a role because it precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""red.""

Drawing from these points, we can make an observation that whenever ""walm"" appears, the output consistently includes ""green green green."" The presence of other words before or after ""walm"" affects the colors that appear before or after this ""green green green"" sequence, but not the sequence itself. 

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" in isolation, disregarding potential modifiers like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or others, can be determined as:

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" is observed, it translates to ""green green green"" in the output.

To articulate this as requested:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:
walm -> always results in ""green green green"" in the output, regardless of context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the examples provided.
Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" correlates directly with the color ""yellow."" There is no contextual variation, as each instance of ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" in the output:

1. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
2. lug zup wif lug -> blue yellow red blue
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" whenever it occurs immediately after the word ""wif."" When ""bluf"" is combined with other words, it seems to generate a repetition of the color that belongs to the word immediately preceding it. For instance, when ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" repeating the color associated with ""wif.""

Now, let's look at the examples to better understand ""bluf"" in different contexts:

Example 1:
- Input: wif bluf
- Output: red red
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the previous color.

Example 2:
- Input: wif dax bluf
- Output: red green green
In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green green,"" further supporting the repetition rule.

Example 3:
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
- Output: green green red yellow blue
""Bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" leading to ""green green"" in the output.

Example 4:
- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" translating to ""red,"" and resulting in ""red red"" in the output.

Example 5:
- Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
- Output: red red yellow red blue green
The first ""bluf"" repetition rule applies after ""wif,"" giving us ""red red."" The second occurrence of ""wif"" doesn't have a ""bluf"" to directly follow, so in this context, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to only apply when ""bluf"" directly follows another word.

Rule: ""Bluf"" -> When presented in a sequence, ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" it specifically results in ""red red.""
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns related to the output and see how ""walm"" influences these outputs.

1. Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the associated color in the output seems to be related to the most recent color mentioned before ""walm.""
   - Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow""; the color before ""walm"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" outputs more ""red.""
   - Input: ""wif dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""red green blue blue blue""; ""blue"" is the color before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" outputs more ""blue.""
   - Input: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> Output: ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""; ""yellow"" is the color before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""
   - Input: ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""; ""yellow"" is the color before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""
   - Input: ""dax zup dax walm"" -> Output: ""green yellow green green green""; ""green"" is the color before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" outputs more ""green.""

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" outputs a sequence of the most recently mentioned color. Hence:

Rule: walm -> repeats the most recent color mentioned before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True,103
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. Whenever the word ""lug"" appears by itself, the output is ""blue"".
2. When ""lug"" is preceded or followed by other words, it similarly corresponds to the word ""blue"", and does not appear to affect the colors associated with the other words.

From this data, we can induce:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red."" Regardless of the sequence or the presence of other words, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red."" Thus:

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output should include ""red"" at the corresponding position.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Each time the word 'zup' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'yellow'.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
4. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
5. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

The word “bluf” appears in each input sentence. By analyzing the output of each example, let's look for a pattern for the word “bluf”:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" again.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" produces ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, we see ""bluf"" twice, and it translates both times to ""yellow.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" again translates to ""green.""

The immediate observation is that ""bluf"" does not consistently map to a single color. Therefore, we must consider the context in which ""bluf"" is used. By comparing the outputs, we can note that ""bluf"" generates the same color as the word that comes directly before it:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. dax bluf -> green green

This pattern consistently holds in all examples given. Therefore, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: The word “bluf” takes on the same color meaning as the word directly preceding it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it continuously until a new color word appears. For instance, whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" repeats in the output. Similarly, following ""lug,"" ""blue"" repeats, and following ""zup,"" ""yellow"" repeats. Thus, ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the previous color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif bluf
    ",Output: green red red,green red red,True,104
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a rule for the nonce word ""wif."" The evidence suggests that ""wif"" acts as a color description duplicator or replicator for a color that immediately follows it. When ""wif"" is present before a color word, the output color is repeated according to the number of letters in the following word. 

For example:
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" has four letters, hence ""red red"".
- In ""wif lug,"" ""lug"" has three letters, hence ""red blue"".
- In ""wif dax zup walm,"" only the word immediately following ""wif"" is duplicated, thus ""dax"" causes ""red"" to be repeated once.

Using this rule, we can propose the following meaning for ""wif"":

wif -> Repeat the output color of the immediately following word according to the number of its letters.

Rule: The color associated with ""wif"" depends on the word that comes right after it. The number of repetitions of that color in the output equates to the number of letters in the word that follows ""wif.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue"". Each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs is directly translated to ""blue"" in the outputs.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare each input with the corresponding output to isolate the effects of ""walm.""

- In the first input ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

- In the second input ""wif walm zup walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" From the previous example, we know ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Therefore, the introduction of ""walm"" in this sequence appears to triple the occurrence of the color that follows. It's important to note that the ""red red red"" output is still valid given ""wif"" preceding the ""walm."" 

- In the third input ""lug walm dax,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green."" We can isolate ""lug"" as ""blue"" from previous references and ""dax"" as ""green."" ""Walm"" follows suit as it did in the previous example and triples the subsequent color output of ""blue."" 

- Onto the fourth input ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" the output is ""yellow green green green blue red."" We can match ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" The presence of ""walm"" before ""lug"" triples the output of ""blue,"" in line with the pattern previously noted.

- Finally, the input ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to the output ""yellow blue blue blue."" We already know ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" As in the other examples, ""walm"" triples the appearance of the subsequent color, which is blue.

From the analysis, we can conclude that ""walm"" triples the output occurrence of the color corresponding to the word that follows it.

Rule: walm -> Triples the occurrence of the subsequent color output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the output. Every instance of the word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green."" No matter the context in which ""dax"" appears (alone or with other words), the output for ""dax"" is always ""green."" Therefore, it can be deduced that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
From the provided examples, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word. Notice how after every occurrence of ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of the color assigned to the preceding word multiple times, resulting in more than one repetition of the color.

For example:
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green and ""wif"" with red. After ""walm,"" red is repeated thrice, which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and is followed by ""green green green"" after ""walm,"" indicating a triple repetition of the color corresponding to ""dax.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times after ""walm,"" again showing this pattern of repetition.

Rule: walm -> Triple repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is replaced with the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Other words that appear with dax have different corresponding outputs: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Taking each example into consideration:

- Input: dax
  Output: green
  dax -> green

- Input: wif lug dax
  Output: red blue green
  wif -> red
  lug -> blue
  dax -> green

- Input: dax

- Input: wif walm dax

  wif -> red
  walm -> red
  dax -> green

- Input: dax bluf zup
  Output: green green yellow
  dax -> green
  bluf -> green
  zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green, consistently meaning that the word dax corresponds to the color green, irrespective of the context within these examples.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" has a consistent output irrespective of its position or the other words involved. In every instance, the presence of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present in an input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Given the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""green."" However, the examples also indicate that ""bluf"" might be followed by a repetition of that color. When ""bluf"" is not followed by another ""bluf,"" it is translated only once as ""green."" When ""bluf"" is followed immediately by another instance of ""bluf,"" the word ""green"" is repeated in the output.

Observations:
- In every instance, the word ""bluf"" results in the word ""green"" being in the output.
- If ""bluf"" is followed by another ""bluf,"" the word ""green"" is repeated.

Based on these observations, the word ""bluf"" represents the color ""green,"" and there's a pattern of repetition when ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""bluf.""

Rule:
bluf -> green (with the additional rule that if ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" the output repeats the color ""green"" twice)
walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of the preceding word."" For instance, when ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", repeating the color 'yellow' three times in total. Following this pattern, when ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm"", the output comprises three instances of the word 'green'. Thus, ""walm"" seems to instruct the output to triple the color word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples, it seems that ""lug"" translates directly to a color in the outputs. To deduce the rule behind it, let us examine the outputs and their corresponding inputs:

1. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", same as ""bluf"".

2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - ""lug"" is the first word and corresponds to ""blue"".

3. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   - Here, ""lug"" appears after ""bluf"" and corresponds to the color ""blue"".

4. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" also translates to the same color immediately after, suggesting that ""lug"" might have the same meaning as ""bluf"" or a rule might affect the translation of ""dax"".

5. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   - Again, ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and translates to ""blue"".

From these examples, the rule for ""lug"" appears consistent:

Rule: lug -> blue

So ""lug"" means blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every given example.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", let's analyze each input-output pair and look for patterns associated with the word ""wif"".

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Here, ""wif"" leads to an output of ""red,"" while ""lug"" results in ""blue.""

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

In this string, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the corresponding output is ""red"" immediately after ""wif,"" while ""bluf"" maps to ""red"". Notably, ""dax"" seems to consistently map to ""green.""

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Similar to the previous example, ""wif"" produces the color ""red,"" with no other new word preceding it to potentially influence this mapping.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

Once more, ""wif"" is mapped to ""red"" in the output sequence.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

This repetition of the first input-output pair confirms that ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Considering these examples, the meaning of ""wif"" based on the pattern in the outputs is consistent regardless of its position in the sequence or neighboring words. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" in this context is the color yellow.
Based on the information provided, the term ""bluf"" seems consistently associated with the color ""yellow"". Every example that includes ""bluf"" results in an instance of ""yellow"" in the output. Furthermore, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", indicating that the term ""bluf"" translates to the same color as ""zup"".

Rule: bluf -> yellow
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by examining the context in which it appears and the corresponding output colors. By looking for patterns in the data, we can attempt to induce the underlying rule.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Let us examine each unique word and their associated output colors:
- ""wif"" seems to be consistently associated with the color red.
- ""lug"" seems to be consistently associated with the color blue.
- ""dax"" seems to be consistently associated with the color green.
- ""zup"" seems to be consistently associated with the color yellow.

Now, let's look at ""walm"" and the colors that follow it:
- After ""dax walm,"" we see ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
- After ""wif walm,"" we see ""red red red,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

We can now apply this logic to the other examples to verify:
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" correlates to ""red red green green green,"" which makes sense if ""walm"" repeats the color green associated with ""dax.""
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" gives us ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" and here, ""walm"" repeats the color blue associated with ""lug.""

Given this consistent pattern across all examples, the rule we can induce is that ""walm"" causes the output of the color associated with the previously mentioned word to be repeated.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" In each example, whenever the word ""dax"" is included in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the corresponding output.

dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on these examples, each input word correlates to a specific color in the output:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output color is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is the first word or follows a word that has not been assigned a specific color, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow (as seen in the second example: ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow""). 

Therefore, we induce the rule that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word, with a default of yellow when it is the first word or follows an unknown color assignment.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word, defaulting to yellow if it is the first word or follows an unassigned word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- When 'dax' precedes 'walm', the output is ""green green green"". 'dax' seems to be associated with the color green.
- When 'zup' precedes 'walm', the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". 'zup' seems to be associated with the color yellow.
- In the case of 'wif walm', the output is ""red red red"", indicating that 'wif' is associated with the color red.
- For 'wif lug zup walm wif lug', we can deduce that 'wif' is red, 'lug' is blue, and 'zup walm' results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", adhering to the same pattern described above.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is that it dictates the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

bluf -> In general, ""bluf"" duplicates the color word that comes before it.
Walm -> repeats the color associated with the word that comes before it thrice.

Rule: Whenever the word 'walm' is used in a sequence, it causes the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding 'walm' to be repeated three times in the output. 

- In ""lug walm,"" 'lug' corresponds to blue, so 'walm' leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""lug walm dax,"" it's ""blue blue blue green"" because 'lug' causes 'walm' to become ""blue blue blue,"" and 'dax' stands for green.
- In ""dax walm zup,"" 'dax' makes 'walm' ""green green green,"" followed by 'zup' which corresponds to yellow.

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given example.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the color patterns associated with the other words that repeat in the examples:

- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""

Now, observe the positions of ""bluf"" and the corresponding color outputs:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" gives ""yellow."" There's nothing to directly compare it with.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" results in two instances of ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" gives two instances of ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these observations, it is clear that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output. The color it represents changes in each example. However, we can notice a pattern: the color output for ""bluf"" is determined by the word that immediately precedes it:

- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and the output is ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce a rule:

bluf -> The color represented by the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: If a word A precedes ""bluf,"" then the output color for ""bluf"" will be the same as the output color for word A.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the common patterns present in each example provided.

1. In ""zup wif walm,"" the word ""walm"" correlates to a repetition of ""red"" three times.
2. In ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and again ""walm"" adds two extra ""red"" after the first ""red"" that follows it.
3. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" also has ""walm"" followed by the three repetitions of the color preceding it, that is ""green,"" and then continues with the colors associated with ""lug"" and ""wif.""
4. ""lug walm"" sees ""walm"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
5. Finally, in ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" once again causes the repetition of ""green"" three times after the color pattern associated with the other words (""dax"" for ""green,"" ""zup"" for ""yellow"").

From the examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the immediate preceding color to repeat three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be understood as repeating the previous color word output three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf zup lug wif
    ",Output: red red yellow blue red,red red yellow blue red,True,111
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, we are attempting to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Let's analyze the color outputs corresponding to the word ""dax"" in each instance:

1. ""dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow""
2. ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green""
3. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green red green yellow yellow""
4. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue green""
5. ""dax zup dax zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow green yellow""

Consistency between the inputs and outputs shows that whenever ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the output ""green."" Let's confirm this by checking where ""green"" appears in the output and what word is present in the corresponding position in the input:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is at the beginning and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is at the end and also corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears twice, both times corresponding to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and end, and in both cases, it corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears twice, separated by ""zup,"" and each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

These instances give a consistent rule that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each time the word ""wif"" appears, it is associated with the color ""red."" The color following ""wif"" varies according to the word that comes after wif. 

Here are the patterns associated with the other words:

- ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" appears to be associated with the color ""blue.""
- ""walm"" is slightly more complex: when it immediately follows ""wif,"" it seems to result in multiple ""red"" outputs, but when not immediately following ""wif,"" it translates to ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" does not immediately follow ""wif"" in any example, but based on the second and third examples, it seems to be consistently associated with ""yellow.""

The 'wif' rule seems to act as a trigger for the start of the color sequence and ensures the first color is always ""red."" Additionally, 'wif' might also indicate repetition of the color ""red"" when a specific word follows it, such as ""walm,"" although more examples would be useful to confirm this pattern.

Here is the deduced rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> The word ""wif"" prompts the color sequence to start with ""red"" and affects the occurrence of subsequent colors depending on the words following it.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Rule: The pseudo-word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that is indicated by the word immediately preceding it. The color is repeated once if ""bluf"" comes after a single color word, or the color is repeated as many times as that single color word appeared consecutively before ""bluf"".

Examples broken down:

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  - zup -> yellow
  - bluf -> repeats the color yellow (as zup indicates yellow and is right before bluf)
  - wif -> red
  - walm -> red 
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  
- Input: lug bluf wif
  - lug -> blue
  - bluf -> repeats the color blue (as lug indicates blue and is right before bluf)
  - wif -> red
  Output: blue blue red

- Input: wif walm lug bluf
  - wif -> red
  - walm -> red
  - lug -> blue
  - bluf -> repeats the color blue (as lug indicates blue and is right before bluf)
  Output: red red red blue blue

- Input: zup dax bluf
  - zup -> yellow
  - dax -> green
  - bluf -> repeats the color green (as dax indicates green and is right before bluf)
  Output: yellow green green

- Input: wif lug bluf wif zup 
  - wif -> red
  - lug -> blue
  - bluf -> repeats the color blue (as lug indicates blue and is right before bluf)
  - wif -> red again
  - zup -> yellow
  Output: red blue blue red yellow

bluf -> repetition of the color indicated by the immediately preceding word.
walm -> repetition of the previous color three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color word immediately preceding it should be repeated three times. 

- In ""dax walm"" (green green green), ""walm"" causes ""dax"" (green) to repeat three times.
- In ""zup walm"" (yellow yellow yellow), ""walm"" causes ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times.
- In ""lug walm"" (blue blue blue), ""walm"" causes ""lug"" (blue) to repeat three times.
- When ""walm"" is used twice as in ""dax walm wif walm"" (green green green red red red), the pattern follows for both instances, causing ""dax"" (green) and then ""wif"" (red) to repeat three times each.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Observing the provided examples, each instance of the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Other words correspond to different colors, but no matter the context, ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be determined as:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it is used.
bluf -> repeating the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence. If ""dax"" is ""green,"" then ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" If ""lug"" is ""blue,"" then ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue,"" and so forth.
Observing the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for what ""walm"" means. Each instance of ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it. Therefore, we can infer that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of what was just mentioned or a continuation of the current state. Here is the data breakdown:

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", red is repeated.
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", blue is repeated.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", red is repeated.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", blue is repeated.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", green is repeated.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", blue is repeated.

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> a command to repeat the color (or possibly any property/attribute) associated with the preceding word.

With that in mind, we can write:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input string or the presence of other words.
Looking at the given examples, we notice that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence. No matter where ""dax"" appears in the input, the output for ""dax"" is ""green"". Therefore, we can deduce that the term ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"".

dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" means ""green"".
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repeating sequence of colors. When ""walm"" is present in the input, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word that appears immediately before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown based on the examples:

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Thus, ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""red.""
2. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Just like the previous example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (equals ""red""), so ""walm"" triply signifies ""red.""
3. ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and thus results in a triple ""red"" before moving on to the color ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
4. ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Hence, ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue"" before proceeding to ""red,"" which is indicated by ""wif.""
5. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" Following the established rule, ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates ""blue blue blue,"" then ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and then the sequence ""lug walm"" repeats the ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it three times.

walm -> meaning: When preceding a color word, walm repeats that color three times in the output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example, regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> meaning: green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. 

Here are the inferences from each given input-output pair:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   
   ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""
   
2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   
   ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and it's possible that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" as it follows ""wif.""
   
3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
   ""wif"" translates to the first ""red,"" ""bluf"" might be associated with another ""red,"" ""dax"" with the first ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond with two instances of ""green.""
   
4. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   
   ""wif"" translates to the first ""red,"" ""bluf"" to the second ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
   
5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   
   This input ends with ""wif,"" which again corresponds to ""red"" at the end of the output. ""lug"" appears to be ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and as previously inferred, ""walm"" leads to a double ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the word ""zup"" appears to be consistent throughout all examples. Each instance where ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the corresponding output position. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, bluf seems to be associated with the color corresponding to the word that immediately follows it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" comes after ""bluf,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red red."" Therefore, bluf causes the output of the color for ""wif"" to be red twice.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed again by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red red.""

- In the third example, ""wif"" is again preceded by bluf, leading to ""red,"" and ""dax"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively, without being affected by ""bluf.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is preceded by bluf, resulting in ""blue blue,"" and ""dax,"" when preceded by bluf, results in ""green green.""

- Finally, in the last example, ""wif"" comes after ""bluf"" twice, leading to ""red red"" and ""yellow red"" when ""wif"" is not preceded by ""bluf.""

Based on these patterns, we can conclude that ""bluf"" causes the output color for the following word to be repeated once. Therefore, ""bluf"" indicates that the color corresponding to the next word should be duplicated.

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the color corresponding to the following word.
walm -> meaning. Rule:

Observing the pattern from the input and the corresponding output, ""walm"" seems to be translated into a series of ""green"" words. The number of times ""green"" appears in the output correlates directly with the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

In the examples provided:
- When ""lug walm"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue"", so ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" must mean a repetition of the color that precedes it, in this case thrice (""blue blue blue"").
- In the input ""dax wif walm lug zup"", the output is ""green red red red blue yellow"". Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and we see ""red red red"" in the output, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.
- Similar patterns follow for the other examples where ""walm"" is followed by a repeating series of the color word that precedes it. The count of repetition equals the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:
Walm -> meaning: ""Repeat the preceding color word as many times as the position of 'walm'.""

So if ""walm"" is the second word in a sequence, the preceding color is repeated twice. If ""walm"" is the third word, the preceding color is repeated thrice, and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: The non-word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears on its own or within a sequence of words, the output is ""green.""

Therefore, the rule that can be drawn from these examples is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> meaning. The meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" based on the given examples is the color ""red"".

Rule: When the input contains ""wif,"" the output is ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in an input, the corresponding output contains the word ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be consistent regardless of context or position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the color meaning of that word and repeats it. So if ""zup"" means yellow, ""zup bluf"" means ""yellow yellow"". If ""dax"" means green, ""dax bluf"" means ""green green"", and so on.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs for any consistent patterns. Let's break down each example to see what ""walm"" might signify:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Observations: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow. ""walm"" appears between ""wif"" and ""dax"" and corresponds to red.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Observations: Without other words for interference, ""zup"" and ""walm"" both correspond to yellow.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Observations: Again, without interference, ""dax"" and ""walm"" both correspond to green.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Observations: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to red. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and also corresponds to red.

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   Observations: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to red.

From the examples given, we can infer that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that is directly in front of it. In cases where ""walm"" is the first word or when there is no word before ""walm,"" it appears to take on a default color not specified in the examples. For instance, the second example shows that ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""zup"" turns to yellow, the color designated for ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" inherits the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word in the examples given, more information would be needed to determine the default color. However, since all examples provided include a word before ""walm,"" we haven't encountered such a case.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the word that precedes it in the list.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in all given examples, regardless of its position or the context within which it is used.
By observing the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" in the outputs. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" immediately follows in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence. Let's test this inference against all the provided examples:

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
Analysis: ""dax"" at the start and end corresponds to ""green"" at the start and end.

Input: zup dax zup lug
Output: yellow green yellow blue
Analysis: ""dax"" sandwiched between two ""zup"" still results in ""green"".

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green
Analysis: ""dax"" at the end still corresponds to ""green"" at the end.

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow
Analysis: Two instances of ""dax"" result in two instances of ""green"".

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Analysis: ""dax"" at the start results in ""green"" at the start, other words appear to correspond to other colors which do not seem consistent with the examples alone.

Given this consistent pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green. Whenever ""dax"" appears in an input sequence, the output is ""green"" at the corresponding position.
Based on the provided examples:

- Every single instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- Other words such as ""dax"", ""bluf"", ""zup"", and ""walm lug"" correspond to their own colors (""green"", ""blue"", ""yellow"", ""red red"").

Therefore, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, each instance of 'zup' corresponds to the word 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input sequence. It does not appear that 'zup' depends on any adjacent words for its meaning. Therefore, we can conclude that 'zup' directly translates to 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" repeats the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. This pattern is consistent across all examples:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" results in another blue.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" results in another yellow.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" duplicates the green.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" results in another red.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" duplicates that color before moving on to other words.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word. Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" output the same color again.
Based on the given examples, walm seems to repeat the color associated with the word just before it three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue,"" so walm repeats ""blue"" three times since ""lug"" is before walm and corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" repeating ""blue"" three times following the same logic.
- ""dax walm lug"" turns into ""green green green blue,"" where ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times since ""dax"" comes before ""walm.""
- ""lug wif walm"" changes to ""blue red red red,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red,"" with ""walm"" repeating ""red"" three times following ""wif.""

Thus, the rule for walm appears to be that it takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it three times.

Walm -> meaning. Rule: walm repeats the color of the word before it three times.

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

In the examples provided, each occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This consistent mapping suggests that ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word 'wif' always corresponds to the output 'red'. Therefore, the meaning of 'wif' can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

The rule is that the word 'wif' represents the color red regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" adds the color ""yellow"" to the output sequence. Each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to a ""yellow"" appearing in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to represent the repetition of the color word that directly precedes it. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is used after a color word, it indicates that the preceding color word should be repeated.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' contributes to the color sequence outputted. To determine the exact effect of 'walm,' we should look for patterns associated with its position in the sequence and the color it produces:

1. When 'walm' follows 'wif,' the output color for 'walm' is yellow:
   - Input: wif walm dax zup → Output: red red red green yellow
   - Input: wif dax zup walm → Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

2. When 'walm' is in the sentence but not preceded by 'wif,' the output color for 'walm' is always green:
   - Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm → Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - Input: wif lug dax walm → Output: red blue green green green
   - Input: dax walm zup lug walm → Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Given the above observations, 'walm' appears to contribute to the output color green, except when it immediately follows 'wif,' in which case it contributes to the output color yellow.

Rule: 'walm' generally changes the output color to green, except when it directly follows 'wif,' where it changes the output to yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, lug consistently translates to ""blue"". 

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word (except for 'dax') is associated with a specific color. To determine the meaning of 'dax', it is necessary to look at the context in which it appears and the corresponding color in the output.

Here are the appearances of 'dax' and their corresponding colors in the output:

- In the first input ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", 'dax' is followed by 'wif', which corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- In the second input ""wif walm dax zup"", 'dax' is followed by ""zup"", which corresponds to ""green"" in the output. 
- In the third input ""dax lug dax"", both instances of 'dax' correspond to ""green"" in the output.
- In the fourth input ""dax"" by itself, the output is ""green.""
- In the fifth input ""dax lug"", 'dax' corresponds to ""green"" in the output again.

In every instance, 'dax' corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or what follows it.

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of 'dax' is the color green.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. There is a one-to-one correspondence regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

The word that precedes ""zup"" also corresponds to a specific color output and appears in reverse order of the input:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

The rule seems to be that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the other nonce words translate to specific colors. These color words are then output in reverse order to their appearance in the input string.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is present in the input, it corresponds to repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the output. 

For instance: 

- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue.
- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to green.

The pattern is consistent across all the given examples. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color represented by the word immediately preceding it.

Examples:

1. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""
   Here, ""dax"" represents green, and after ""walm"" is used, ""green"" is repeated two more times. After ""wif"" which corresponds to red, ""red"" is repeated three times due to the presence of ""walm"". 

2. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
   ""dax"" represents green and ""wif"" represents red. The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times.

3. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
   ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, and after ""walm"", yellow is repeated two more times. Then, ""wif"" is red, followed by another ""walm"" which results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

4. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
   ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and the presence of ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times. ""lug"" is blue, which is not affected since ""walm"" is not following it.

5. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
   ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in the repetition of yellow two more times. ""lug"" as blue stands alone without repetition because it is not preceded by ""walm"".

Walm -> meaning: Cause the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color blue. Every instance of ""lug"" in the input maps to the word ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green in each example provided.
Rule: wif -> red

Explanation: In every example, the presence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output of the color ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the words around it, the output consistently includes ""red."" This indicates that ""wif"" represents the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before it. If it follows ""lug"", output is ""blue"". If it follows ""zup"", output is ""yellow"". If it follows ""dax"" or ""wif"", output is ""green"" or ""red"" respectively.
From the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" influences the color words that follow it in a specific way. When ""walm"" appears, the color word that immediately precedes it repeats as the color output for the following terms until a new color word is encountered. Here are the breakdowns:

1. lug zup walm lug
   blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   (""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is the first yellow, after the ""walm"" the second and third yellows are repeating the color before ""walm"", and then ""lug"" is blue again.)

2. dax walm zup walm
   green green green yellow yellow yellow
   (""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" repeats the green two more times, then ""zup"" is yellow followed by ""walm"" which then repeats the yellow two more times.)

3. wif bluf dax walm
   red red green green green
   (""wif"" and ""bluf"" are red, ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm"" the green is repeated two more times.)

4. wif lug walm
   red blue blue blue
   (Here ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm"" the blue is repeated two more times.)

5. lug walm wif lug bluf
   blue blue blue red blue blue
   (""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" causes the blue to repeat twice, ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue and ""bluf"" causes an extra blue.)

Based on the observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated until a new color word appears.

Therefore, walm -> causes the immediately preceding color word's color to repeat until the next color word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the information provided in the examples, it appears that each instance of a nonce word corresponds to a specific color name in the output. Furthermore, the same nonce word always corresponds to the same color in different contexts. 

Here are the correlations mentioned in the examples:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow (from the repetition pattern in the last example)

Therefore, based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Based on the given input-output pairs, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red. Hence, ""wif"" means red.

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf duplicates the color word that immediately precedes it. 

Explanation: In each example, the word immediately before ""bluf"" is transformed into a color in the output, and this color is repeated twice. The word bluf itself does not directly translate to a specific color but instead serves as an instruction to duplicate the color word it follows.

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates this color, resulting in ""red red.""
- In ""zup bluf lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is then duplicated by ""bluf"" to ""yellow yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates this color to ""green green,"" preceded by the color for ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" hence ""red red"" from ""wif bluf,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which seems to be another green, making it ""green green green.""

bluf -> duplicates the previous color word.
walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" changes the subsequent color outputs to blue until either ""wif"" or ""zup"" appears, which change the sequence to red or yellow respectively.

Rule: Upon encountering ""walm,"" all following words are translated to ""blue"" until a word that dictates a color change is encountered, where ""wif"" changes the output to ""red"" and ""zup"" changes the output to ""yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" in this context represents the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" We can see this because every output includes the color ""yellow"" whenever the input includes the word ""zup."" However, the additional words after ""zup"" seem to add more colors to the output: ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""bluf"" results in an additional ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" results in ""blue."" 

Given that ""zup"" on its own always results in ""yellow,"" we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

The additional colors following ""zup"" in the input are determined by other words that are not consistently present. Therefore, our focus is solely on ""zup,"" which correlates to ""yellow.""
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" when it is preceded by ""wif,"" to the color ""green"" when it is preceded by ""dax,"" and to ""yellow"" when it is preceded by ""zup."" The pattern indicates that the meaning of ""bluf"" may change depending on the word that comes immediately before it.

Examining the input and output pairs:

1. wif bluf -> red
2. dax bluf -> green
3. zup bluf -> yellow

The rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is preceded by:
- ""wif,"" then bluf means ""red.""
- ""dax,"" then bluf means ""green.""
- ""zup,"" then bluf means ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the ""walm"" seems to be linked with the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. We can see this pattern clearly by examining the context around each occurrence of ""walm"":

1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated.

2. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" leads to ""green red red red blue yellow."" In this example, the word ""wif"" is directly before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" which is then repeated after ""walm.""

3. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and we see the repetition of ""red"" after ""walm.""

4. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and we observe a repetition of ""blue"" after ""walm.""

5. ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red,"" repeating the pattern of ""walm"" following ""wif"" with ""red"" being repeated.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
dax -> green. Rule: In all given examples, whenever the term ""dax"" is used, the output is invariably ""green."" Hence, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
The examples provided suggest that ""wif"" is related to a color, which appears to be ""red"". In each case, the presence of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the Output. It does not seem dependent on position or surrounding words. Each appearance of ""wif"" results in ""red"" being mentioned in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given inputs and outputs.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following correlations:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".

Observe that ""bluf"" appears between ""dax"" and other colors, and in the third input, it appears alone with ""dax"". In all cases with ""bluf"", ""dax"" precedes it, and no additional word causes any additional color in the output sequence. This consistency, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" (whether it's followed by another word or not), indicates that ""bluf"" itself does not correspond to a new color but rather is a repetition indicator for the preceding color, which in this case is always ""green"" associated with ""dax"".

Furthermore, when ""bluf"" appears without the word ""dax"" before it, such as in the last input, it doesn't produce any additional color in the output, confirming the idea that it acts in relation to the word that precedes it (which needs to be ""dax"" in the given examples).

Rule:
bluf -> Indicates a repetition of the color associated with ""dax"", which is ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the preceding color word three times in the output. Analyzing the given data:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"".
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" still results in ""red red red"", even when another color word ""bluf"" (yellow) precedes ""wif"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", and in the output, this results in ""green green green"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" and is consistent even when it is repeated, implying that the rule applies whenever ""walm"" is used after a color word.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the immediately preceding color word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it. Here are the examples mapped out clearly:

- ""dax wif dax"" translates to ""green red green,"" thus ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax lug dax wif dax"" translates to ""green blue green red green,"" which further confirms that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green,"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears on its own or precedes ""zup"" in the sequence, the output is consistently ""green,"" which again confirms the correspondence between ""dax"" and the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green. (i.e., the word ""dax"" represents the color green)
Based on the examples provided and the consitent output that follows each input, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". So:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax"" and to the color ""blue"" when it follows any other word or stands alone. 

Rule application shown below:

- dax bluf -> green
- lug bluf -> blue
- zup bluf -> blue
- wif bluf -> blue
- bluf dax -> green

Thus the word ""bluf"" doesn't have a fixed meaning, but its meaning changes depending on whether it is preceded by the word ""dax"" or not.
walm -> repeating the color that comes before it two more times

Rule: When the ""walm"" term is used, it repeats the color word that precedes it twice, effectively creating three instances of that color in a sequence. If ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" three times. If it appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" three times. If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" across all examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example provided, irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever wif appears, red is outputted.
- The presence of wif does not change with the presence or absence of other words.

From this, we can deduce that wif is directly translated to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the word ""red"" when it is preceded by the word ""wif,"" and it translates to ""blue"" when it is preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup."" There isn’t an example showing ""bluf"" standing alone or following ""dax"" or ""walm,"" so it is unknown what ""bluf"" would mean in those cases. 

The rule seems to be context-dependent, specifically on the word that comes before ""bluf."" Here is the interpretation of the rule:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it means ""red."" If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" or ""zup,"" it means ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns where the word appears and the corresponding outputs.

In the first example, we have:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

In this sequence, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue but after ""walm"" it becomes green before returning to blue again for ""lug."" Therefore, ""walm"" prompted a change from blue to green, but only for a single position. It is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to green. 

In the second example:

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

The word ""walm"" appears at the end and the output becomes a repetition of the word before it, ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. Here, ""walm"" seems to double the output value that comes before it.

In the third example:

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

After ""walm"" the color green is repeated, but it's the same color as the input before ""walm,"" which is ""dax,"" represented by green.

In the fourth example:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated again twice after ""walm"" appears. 

In the fifth example:

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

In this case, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and then ""zup."" After ""walm,"" like in example 1 and 3, the color green appears. But it's not a simple repetition of the previous color (yellow, from ""zup""), and instead follows the color corresponding to ""dax.""

Considering these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to change to the color green for the position that follows it, regardless of what the input word is. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the output color for the next position is green. 

So:

walm -> meaning. Rule: The following item produces the output green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue"" in each given example, regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Every time ""dax"" appears, the output is consistently ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

1. ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red"". Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""walm"" must then be ""red"".
2. ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red"".
3. ""lug zup wif zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow red yellow"". Thus, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is confirmed again as ""yellow"".
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". Based on previous examples, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" is ""red"" and therefore ""dax"" must be ""green"".
5. ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow"". This supports ""zup"" being ""yellow"".

We can determine that regardless of position, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be that the word ""wif"" stands for the color red in this context.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, the rule for the word ""zup"" can be induced as follows:

When ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" It does not matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence or what other words are in the sequence; whenever ""zup"" is in the input, the output will always include ""yellow.""

Therefore, the meaning assigned to ""zup"" in this context is the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, looking for patterns:

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

From these inputs and outputs, we can observe that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single color. Instead, its representation in the output seems dependent on the preceding words. Let's analyze the outputs that follow ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by red, despite ""wif"" being before ""bluf"" and corresponding to ""red"" in the output.
- In the second, third, and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is followed by yellow twice within the same output, suggesting a repeat of the color that comes directly before ""bluf.""
- The fifth example again shows ""bluf"" being followed by yellow, which is the color corresponding to ""zup,"" the word that comes directly before ""bluf.""

Given this information, we can infer that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color mentioned right before it in the sequence. Therefore, ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> The color that is represented by the word directly before ""bluf.""
Rule: walm -> the color of the previous word repeated. If there is no previous word, walm is red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" is used, the color blue appears in the output in the corresponding position. Here's how it plays out across the examples:

1. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
2. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
3. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
4. ""lug zup dax wif zup"" -> ""blue yellow green red yellow""
5. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples given, it appears that each word in the input is assigned a specific color in the output, with ""wif"" consistently resulting in the color red, no matter its position in the sequence. Hence, we can deduce:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow.""
Rule: walm -> the word that follows 'walm' is repeated three times in the output. If 'walm' is the last word, the color corresponding to the word immediately before 'walm' is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all the provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Observing the patterns from the given examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Regardless of the context in the inputs, each time ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is part of the respective output. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the corresponding output includes one instance of the word ""red"" for each occurrence of ""wif"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: In each example, the presence of the word ""zup"" correlates with the output of the color ""yellow"". Regardless of what follows ""zup"" in the input, ""yellow"" is always the first color in the output, suggesting that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, looking for patterns.

1. When ""bluf"" is at the end of the input string, the corresponding output ends with one more red than there are instances of the word right before ""bluf."" In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" so ""bluf"" here seems to cause the replication of the color that ""wif"" stands for, plus an extra red.

2. In the second example, ""wif"" occurs twice before ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow red red red,"" which follows the same pattern - two repetitions of the color that ""wif"" stands for (red) plus an extra red.

3. In the third example, ""dax"" is immediately before ""bluf,"" and the output is ""green green red."" The pattern holds as ""dax"" stands for green, and we see it repeated once plus an extra red.

4. However, when ""bluf"" isn't at the end (it's followed by another word), the output is two instances of the color corresponding to the word right after ""bluf.""

5. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output has ""green"" twice, which corresponds to ""dax,"" the word before ""bluf.""

6. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and we see ""yellow"" twice in the output, which corresponds to ""zup,"" the word before ""bluf.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

- When ""bluf"" is followed by a word, the output is two instances of the color that corresponds to the following word.
- When ""bluf"" is at the end of the input, the output is one duplication of the color associated with the preceding word, followed by an additional red.

Therefore, the rule is: 

Rule: If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, output two instances of the color corresponding to the word after ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is the last word, output the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"" repeated once, followed by an extra ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's look for patterns in each instance it's used and the corresponding output.

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to a repetition of ""blue"", suggesting ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the last color"".

2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again and results in an additional ""blue"".

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Walm"" occurs after ""dax"", which is green, and the color green is repeated twice after.

4. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   In this sequence, ""walm"" occurs after ""wif"" and the color red is repeated, it also occurs after ""zup"" and the color yellow is repeated. This supports the idea that ""walm"" may mean ""repeat.""

5. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   Again after ""dax"", which corresponds to green, the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color green before ""lug"" changes it to blue.

Given the above examples, the rule can be determined as:

Rule: ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

So,

walm -> meaning. Meaning: repeat the last color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,128
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning is the color blue. Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
To determine the rule for ""wif"", we need to look at each example and identify patterns tied to its occurrences:

1. zup wif -> yellow red
   wif dax -> red green
   When ""wif"" stands alone (followed by a distinct word), we see it translates directly to ""red.""

2. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
   The second ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" which we know from previous examples, translates to ""green."" Here, ""wif"" sits between two identical words ""lug,"" and it translates to ""red."" This is consistent with our initial observation from the first pattern.

3. wif lug -> red blue
   ""wif"" comes before ""lug,"" which we've seen translates to ""blue."" Again, ""wif"" itself translates to ""red.""

4. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   We see that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" then ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""walm"" after ""wif"" has a repeated color ""red,"" and when it follows ""zup,"" it changes to ""yellow."" In this example, ""wif"" is not delimited by the same word on both sides nor stands alone; it precedes a word that then replicates its color, although this behavior changes when we see ""walm"" elsewhere in the sequence.

From the given examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red,"" potentially with the added rule that the word following ""wif"" may replicate the color ""red"" if immediately followed by ""wif,"" although further examples might be needed to confirm that last part of the rule outside of the ""wif walm"" pattern.

Rule: wif -> ""red""

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" appears after another color word, it takes on the color meaning of that preceding word. If ""bluf"" is the first word, or if there are no prior color words, the rule cannot be determined from the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, there seems to be a pattern between the input word ""walm"" and the output colors. If we analyze each instance:

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""walm"" -> red red

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> green green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""walm"" -> red red

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> green green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> green green

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> blue blue

The pattern indicates that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it twice. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" in the context of these examples as:

walm -> meaning. The meaning is to repeat the color associated with the previous word two times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color of the previous word two times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup bluf
    ",Output: green red yellow yellow,green red yellow yellow,True,129
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, one can induce that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" 

Here is the analysis step by step:

- In every example where ""lug"" is present, the word ""blue"" also appears in the output.
- The word ""lug"" does not seem to change its output meaning based on position, as it consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of where it is placed in the input.
- No other word in the input that corresponds to the color blue is repeated, therefore ""lug"" must be the word that is resulting in the color blue in the output.

Therefore, we can state the rule as: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every instance it appears.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the provided examples.
bluf -> repeated color of the preceding word. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word representing a color, it takes on the meaning of that color word and repeats it.
walm -> Rule: 'walm' appears to translate into a repetition of the color or property associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Evidence:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif walm,"" 'zup' translates to 'yellow' and 'wif' to 'red.' 'Walm' following 'wif' leads to 'red' repeated three times, indicating walm means repeat the prior color three times.

2. In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif,"" we see 'dax' is 'green,' 'zup' is 'yellow,' and 'wif' is 'red.' After 'zup' and before 'wif,' 'walm' causes 'yellow' to be repeated three times, further supporting the rule.

3. The third example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" follows the pattern with 'dax' translating to 'green', 'wif' as 'red,' and 'lug' as 'blue.' Each instance of 'walm' causes the preceding color ('green' from 'dax' and 'green' again after the second 'dax') to be repeated three times.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm,"" 'dax' translates to 'green,' and 'walm' causes this color to be repeated, yielding 'green green green.'

5. The fifth example is identical to the first and serves as a reinforcement of the initially observed rule, with 'walm' causing 'red' to be repeated three times after 'wif.'

Rule: Walm means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue green,True,130
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we should first look at the constant presence of ""lug"" in the input and its corresponding output to identify any patterns.

1. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
2. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow green green green blue red""
3. ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue""
4. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
5. ""dax wif lug"" -> ""green red blue""

A closer examination reveals the following observations:

- Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output.
- The position of ""blue"" in the output corresponds directly to the position of ""lug"" in the input.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

lug -> ""blue""

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

This means that every time the word ""wif"" is used in the input, the output includes the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the word or color ""yellow"". Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. The presence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" as well, based on the 4th example where ""bluf"" in input leads to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
The examples provided suggest that the nonce word ""bluf"" has a rule associated with immediately preceding it. It appears that ""bluf"" causes the preceding word to be repeated in the output. Let's analyze the examples given.

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and ""red"" is repeated.

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup dax bluf"" leads to ""yellow green green,"" so ""dax"" output is ""green"" and then it is repeated due to ""bluf.""
   - ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" but ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" producing an additional ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" stands alone and translates to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""red red.""
   - ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" implying that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word, which is the same as the rule deduced for ""bluf.""

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

5. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   - ""lug"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""
   - ""dax"" followed by ""bluf"" gives ""green green.""

Bluf -> meaning. The rule appears to be that when ""bluf"" follows a word, it causes the color associated with that word to be repeated in the output. Rule: If a word X is followed by ""bluf,"" then in the output, the color corresponding to word X is repeated.
walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the color repetition of the preceding word. To be precise, we see that in examples where ""walm"" is present, the color associated with the word before ""walm"" is repeated multiple times, equal to the number of letters in the preceding word. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and then ""walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which is three times red, corresponding to the three letters in ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" occurs again, resulting in ""red red red.""
- The third example shows ""zup walm"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" is associated with yellow and there are three letters in ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, the pattern holds with ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red.""
- Similarly, in the last example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" relates to green and there are three letters in ""dax.""

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat for as many times as there are letters in that word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output color is repeated a number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
From the given examples, it appears that the word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green.' Therefore, we can posit the following rule based on the data provided:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every instance of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. 

In the given examples, 'bluf' results in the repetition of the color mentioned before it. If 'zup' is yellow, 'zup bluf' is 'yellow yellow'. If 'dax' is green, 'dax bluf' is 'green green'. Therefore, 'bluf' means to duplicate the color word preceding it.
walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, ""walm"" appears to mean ""repeat the previous color.""

Rule:
Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. The context of the sentence does not seem to affect its meaning. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the provided examples and outputs to find patterns:

1. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Dax"" appears at the beginning here, and the entire output is ""green.""

3. Input: dax zup dax
   Output: green yellow green
   Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green,"" and there is a ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green
   Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and it appears after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   ""Dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and the other words correspond to colors in sequence as they appear in previous outputs (e.g., ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red"").

From these examples, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. There is no variation in this relationship across all given examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every instance it is used.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it translates to the color word that represents the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. 

To confirm, let's look at each example:

1. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", followed by ""bluf"", which corresponds to the color before it, again ""red"".

2. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup | Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", followed by ""bluf"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" again, then the pattern continues with the other colors always repeating the color that comes before ""bluf"".

3. Input: zup lug bluf wif | Output: yellow blue blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", followed by ""bluf"" which repeats the ""blue"".

4. Input: lug bluf wif | Output: blue blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", followed by ""bluf"" repeating the ""blue"".

5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf | Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", followed by ""bluf"" which repeats the ""yellow"".

This consistent pattern in the examples given leads to the rule:

Rule: bluf -> the word bluf translates to the color word immediately preceding it.
From the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.

For example, in ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" and so on.

Therefore, we can deduce that:

walm -> repeat the color word that comes immediately before it, three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the instances where ""lug"" appears.

From the examples:

1. When ""lug"" appears in an input sequence, ""blue"" appears in the output sequence.
2. The position of ""lug"" in the input sequence corresponds to the position of ""blue"" in the output sequence.

Given every example input that includes ""lug"" results in an output with ""blue"" in the corresponding position, we can conclude that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Given the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, the number of times ""red"" is repeated in the output appears to be dependent on the presence and quantity of other words in the input. Notably, when ""walm"" is present alongside ""wif,"" the word ""red"" is repeated three times in the output.

It appears that the repetition of ""red"" in the output corresponds to this pattern:
- When ""wif"" is by itself, the output is ""red"" once.
- When ""wif"" is accompanied by ""walm,"" ""red"" is output three times.
- When ""wif"" is accompanied by an additional word (""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""dax""), ""red"" is output once, and those additional words have their corresponding color outputs (""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"").

Given these observations, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output. The repetition or presence of additional colors is influenced by the other words in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> ""red"" (repeated based on the presence of certain words, like ""walm"", which causes ""red"" to repeat three times).
Based on the information given, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs provided. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input examples is directly translated to ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the context of other words.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds with repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here are the breakdowns according to each example:

1. In the phrase ""dax walm zup walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" After ""walm"" we see that the color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

2. In the phrase ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Each time ""walm"" appears, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times.

3. In the phrase ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" has no direct output but precedes ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times, which corresponds to ""lug.""

4. In the phrase ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

5. In the phrase ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times, which corresponds to ""zup.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, the word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue'. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". Here is the rule derived from the input-output examples provided:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we need to look at the patterns and differences between the input and output for each example. Compare the inputs that include ""wif"" and their corresponding outputs to identify what ""wif"" translates to or what rule it might represent.

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

Input: dax wif lug
Output: green red blue

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

Considering the examples provided, we can make a few observations:

1. Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the corresponding output always includes ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" follows a different word, the color associated with that word in the sequence is reflected before ""red"" in the output. 
    - In the third example, 'dax wif lug', ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so we get ""green red"" followed by the color for ""lug"" which is ""blue"".
    - Likewise in the fourth and fifth examples, the color corresponding to the word before ""wif"" (for ""zup"" it's ""yellow"" and for ""dax"" it's ""green"") appears before ""red"" in the output.
3. In the first example where ""wif"" is at the end, the color ""red"" is followed by an additional color ""yellow"". This implies that the position of ""wif"" at the end of a sequence might add an additional color to the sequence.

With these observations, we can formulate a rule for ""wif"":

Rule: When ""wif"" follows a word, it adds ""red"" after the color corresponding to that word in the output. If ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, it adds ""red"" after repeating the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.

Therefore:
wif -> When following a word, adds ""red"" after the color for that word. If at the end, adds ""red"" followed by an additional color that corresponds to the word before it.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""zup"" is used, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Observing the examples, where ""bluf"" is present in the Input and looking at its corresponding Output, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule of ""bluf"".

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
Input: dax zup lug zup bluf -> Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
Input: lug dax bluf -> Output: blue green green

Considering that the position of ""bluf"" does not impact its Output (it is red when it follows ""wif"", green when it follows ""dax"", and blue when it follows ""lug""), we can determine that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.
Given the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" by examining the patterns and the resulting colors.

Looking at the output sequence, we can observe that after the word ""walm"" is used, the color that follows is a repetition of the color that preceded ""walm."" For example:

- In the first input ""zup walm dax,"" the color sequence is ""yellow yellow green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" induces a repetition of ""yellow"" before proceeding to ""green"" for ""dax.""
- In the second input ""bluf wif walm,"" we have ""yellow red red red,"" which again shows ""walm"" causing a repeat of ""red.""
- Similar behavior is observed in the rest of the examples, where ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that came immediately before it.

Therefore, given these observations, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" in this context means to repeat the color that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that comes immediately before this word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,135
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can induce that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the same relative position.

Here's the evidence supporting this rule:

- In examples where ""lug"" is the only word (""lug""), blue is the only color in the output.
- When ""lug"" is preceded or followed by ""wif"" (""wif lug"", ""lug wif""), ""blue"" takes the corresponding position relative to ""red"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" appears with other words like ""zup"" and ""dax"" which presumably correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"", ""blue"" is still in the output in the position corresponding to ""lug"".
- When ""lug"" is enclosed by the word ""wif"" twice (""wif lug wif""), we see ""red"" on both sides of ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, maintaining its position relative to other colors.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green."" Every instance in the input where the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" appears in the output, with the same frequency. Moreover, ""dax"" seems independent of its position within the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be consistent across all instances. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words, ""wif"" consistently maps to the word ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look at the patterns in the given examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: lug zup lug
   Output: blue yellow blue

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

In every instance, when ""zup"" is encountered in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. None of the other input words consistently result in the output of ""yellow."" This pattern suggests that the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, and the color it translates to depends on the word that precedes it. Here's the rule that I can deduce from the given examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""

From these instances, we can infer a rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf."" Since the color associated with the preceding word is duplicated once ""bluf"" is mentioned, it seems ""bluf"" acts as a doubling modifier of the color mentioned before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
From the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to consistently correspond with the word ""green"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sentence, each time ""walm"" appears, the word ""green"" also appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Given the examples, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> green

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Rules:

The consistent output associated with the word ""lug"" in all examples is ""blue,"" regardless of what other words accompany it. Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" refers to the color ""blue.""
Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears as an input, the output is ""green.""
Rule: 

Based on the given examples, ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the output.

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means that every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, regardless of its position or the presence of other words, the corresponding output includes the color ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" replicates the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

1. dax bluf -> green green (dax correlates to green, and bluf replicates it)
2. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue (lug correlates to blue, and bluf replicates it)
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (zup correlates to yellow, and bluf replicates it)
4. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow (dax correlates to green, and bluf replicates it, but does not continue to replicate zup)
5. lug bluf -> blue blue (lug correlates to blue, and bluf replicates it)

Rule: bluf -> replicates the color of the preceding word.
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: When 'walm' follows another word, it causes the output color of the previous word to be repeated for as long as 'walm' continues, until a new word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" The meaning of ""dax"" doesn't seem to change with context—it always results in the color green regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be:

zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in the output.
Rule: bluf -> repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it twice.
walm -> ""repeat the color of the first word""

Rule: When ""walm"" is used in a sequence, it indicates that the color of the word preceding ""walm"" should be repeated for the number of times ""walm"" is used.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples provided, the rule appears to be consistent in associating the nonce word ""lug"" with a specific color:

- ""lug walm"" produces three ""blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue,"" while ""walm"" seems to have no effect on the output in this particular instance.
- A single instance of ""lug"" consistently outputs ""blue.""
- ""lug zup lug"" gives ""blue yellow blue,"" implying that ""lug"" remains ""blue,"" and ""zup"" might correlate to ""yellow"" in this sequence.
- ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue,"" suggesting ""dax"" is likely represented by ""green,"" while ""lug"" remains ""blue.""

Based on these examples, we can deduce the following meaning:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the following pattern is observed:

- ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to the output ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""blue""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red""

The word ""dax"" corresponds to different outputs depending on its position:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"" when followed by other words
- In the second example, it corresponds to ""green"", and the word that follows is ""red"" which is the output for ""wif""
- In the third example, it corresponds to ""green"", when following the word ""zup"" which is ""yellow""
- In the fourth example, it corresponds to ""green"" both times, appearing after ""wif"" (""red"") and before and after ""lug"" (""blue"")
- In the fifth example, it corresponds to ""green"" once again, appearing after the sequence ""red yellow red""

Considering these examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Every instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" 

Here's how we arrive at this:

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Here ""bluf"" is associated with the second ""red"" in the output given that ""wif"" is consistently translating to ""red"" in all examples.
  
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" reinforcing that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when we again see that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

- In the third example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" Here, we can see that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" and is followed by ""green red."" Given the consistency of the other translations, it is reinforced that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue."" Once again, ""dax"" is translated to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" with the output being ""green red,"" contributing to the pattern that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

- Finally, the fifth example is identical to the second, with the same input ""wif bluf"" and output ""red red,"" which serves to confirm the previous observations.

So, the rule is:

bluf -> red.
Analyzing each of the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm"" by examining its context and the output sequences it generates. Here's what each example provides us:

- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" gives us ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" Since ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" we can see that ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. In this case, it repeats ""blue"" once and ""red"" twice.
- ""zup walm"" outputs to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and repeats ""yellow"" twice.
- ""zup dax walm"" changes to ""yellow green green green."" The ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" which leads to a repetition of ""green"" three times.
- ""wif lug dax walm"" yields ""red blue green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" three times.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" converts to ""green green green red red red yellow."" The first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" twice. The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats ""red"" twice.

From each of these examples, we can observe that ""walm"" causes a triplication of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence. If the preceding word corresponds to a color, ""walm"" outputs that color three more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example given.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context of surrounding words.
Rule: wif -> red

In every example, whenever the word ""wif"" is used, the output consistently includes the color ""red."" This direct correlation suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each occurrence, regardless of context.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the relationship between the input and the output in the provided examples. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and both correspond to ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and both correspond to ""red.""

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and both correspond to ""blue.""

4. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   - In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green."" The subsequent words have different colors associated with them.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" here, which is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is consistent in output color despite not being preceded directly by ""bluf.""

Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word immediately before it. Hence, for each input where ""bluf"" follows another word, the color of that preceding word is repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> copies the color of the word that comes immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how the word is used in different contexts:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times before a ""red"" appears. 
   Example: lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue 

2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
   Example: zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow 
   
3. When ""walm"" is used in a sequence with other words, the color after ""walm"" seems to repeat three times unless another word interrupts the sequence.
   Example: dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue 
   
4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""zup,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times before ""yellow"" appears.
   Example: lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow 

5. When ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
   Example: lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue 

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. Therefore, ""walm"" can be interpreted as an instruction to repeat the previous word's associated color three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: The word ""wif"" correlates to the color red regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" can be consistently replaced by the color ""yellow"". 

Therefore, the rule is: 
zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""green"" each time it appears. No matter what other words or order are present, the output for ""walm"" is always ""green."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" is directly replaced by the color ""blue"" in the Output, regardless of the context in which it appears in the Input.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we must look at all the given examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
2. wif dax -> red green
3. zup wif dax -> yellow red green
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax wif -> green red

From the examples, we can observe that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, one ""green"" appears in the output. Additionally, it looks like every other word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, regardless of the presence of ""dax."" For instance, ""lug"" always results in ""blue,"" ""zup"" always results in ""yellow,"" ""wif"" always results in ""red,"" and ""walm"" always results in ""green"" when it occurs without ""dax."" However, when ""dax"" is present and precedes ""walm,"" the output is an extra ""green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" might represent the phrase ""green green.""

Based on this information, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green green

This would make sense because in each instance of ""dax,"" exactly two ""green""s are added to the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently. Regardless of its position in the sentence, when ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is produced in the output. 

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" appears to map to the color ""yellow"" each time it is used. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it, ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow."" We do not have enough information to determine if ""zup"" depends on contextual factors beyond its immediate appearance.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Meaning: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it. 

In each example, the word ""bluf"" follows another word, and the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated. Here is how the examples support this rule:

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
- ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" follows, leading to ""green green"".

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- Again, ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""bluf"", which results in ""green green"".

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""Wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""bluf"", thus ""red red"".

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green
- Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to green, leading to ""green green"" at the end of the output sequence.

Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue
- ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and with ""bluf"" after it, the output is ""blue blue"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word 'walm' causes the output to repeat the color of the word preceding it three times. 

Here's the analysis:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" implying 'walm' repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- In ""lug walm zup lug walm"", 'walm' results in ""blue blue blue"" after ""lug"" and repeats ""blue"" again three times after the second ""lug.""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so 'walm' is repeating the yellow of ""zup.""
- ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" once again showing that 'walm' repeats the color of the preceding word, which for ""lug"" is blue.
- For ""wif walm dax,"" 'walm' generates ""red red red,"" meaning it repeats the red of ""wif.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

2. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
3. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
5. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow""

Looking at the translation of each sequence involving ""dax,"" we see that ""dax"" at the beginning or end of a sequence translates to ""green."" We also notice that when ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" or preceded by ""bluf,"" it still translates to ""green."" Additionally, in sequence 2, ""dax"" surrounded by other words also translates to ""green.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each example.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the given examples. Every instance of 'zup' is translated to 'yellow'.
Rule: bluf -> blue 
When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is always ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. Here is how the rule seems to apply in each example:

- Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" results in repeating ""yellow"" the number of times indicated.

- Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
  ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and therefore ""walm"" reproduces ""red"" the number of times indicated.

- Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
  ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, leading to the repetition of ""blue"" as indicated by ""walm.""

- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
  ""walm"" follows both ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue) in two different spots, reproducing the respective color each time.

- Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
  ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, hence ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""yellow.""

Based on the above observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color word that comes before it three times in sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", regardless of context within the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the input string or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> the color ""red"" repeated as many times as there are letters in the word following ""wif"". 

Therefore, if the word following ""wif"" has three letters (e.g., ""walm""), the output is ""red red red"". If the word following ""wif"" has two letters (e.g., ""zup""), the output is ""red yellow"". The other colors (yellow, green, blue) seem to be determined by the words that follow ""wif"" and the number of letters they contain, but the examples provided only allow us to induce the rule for ""wif"" specifically.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Every instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position.
bluf -> switch the colors from the previous word. Rule: The output color for 'bluf' depends on the color output of the preceding word. If the preceding word's output is 'red', 'bluf' causes a switch to 'blue', if it's 'blue', it becomes 'red', and if it is 'yellow', it stays 'yellow'.
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the output in relation to the word ""walm"" to derive its meaning or the rule it follows:

1. In the first example, ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" on its own, the additional ""walm"" results in two more repetitions of ""yellow"".

2. In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". Here, ""bluf"" is not given a color, and ""wif"" means ""red"". When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it seems to repeat the color red twice more, similar to example one's repetition.

3. The third example has ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" resulting in ""blue green yellow green green green red"". We know ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""wif"" is ""red"". Here ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" two more times.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". Once again, ""walm"" repeats the color that precedes it two more times.

5. Finally, the fifth example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", turns into ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". After ""zup"", ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times, disregarding ""bluf"".

The rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it is apparent that ""lug"" consistently maps to the output ""blue"". Therefore, the rule that can be induced from the examples is as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: 

dax -> green

The word ""dax"" results in the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This is indicated by the consistent output of ""green"" whenever ""dax"" appears in the input.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red each time it is presented. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it in the sequence.

Here are the examples with this rule applied:

1. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" occurs again at the end, it retains its previously assigned color from this sequence, which is ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> The color that precedes it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word, it takes the color from its first appearance in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to trigger the repetition of the color that follows it three times. Each word before ""walm"" seems to correspond to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

When ""walm"" is used, it takes the color associated with the word immediately after it and repeats that color three times in the output. Here are the examples mapped to this rule:

1. lug zup walm lug: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - 'lug' translates to 'blue'
   - 'zup' translates to 'yellow'
   - 'walm' triggers the repetition of 'yellow' three times
   - 'lug' again translates to 'blue'

2. zup wif walm: yellow red red red
   - 'zup' translates to 'yellow'
   - 'wif' translates to 'red'
   - 'walm' triggers the repetition of 'red' three times

3. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - 'wif' translates to 'red'
   - 'walm' triggers the repetition of 'red' three times
   - 'zup' translates to 'yellow'
   - 'lug' translates to 'blue'
   - 'wif' translates to 'red'
   - 'walm' again triggers the repetition of 'red' three times
   - 'zup' translates to 'yellow'

4. lug dax walm: blue green green green
   - 'lug' translates to 'blue'
   - 'dax' translates to 'green'
   - 'walm' triggers the repetition of 'green' three times

5. dax walm wif bluf: green green green red red
   - 'dax' translates to 'green'
   - 'walm' triggers the repetition of 'green' three times
   - 'wif' translates to 'red'

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> triggers the repetition of the subsequent color three times.

    Rules:

Rule: The word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue' in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" In every example where the word ""dax"" is present, the output includes the color ""green."" The position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to matter; it consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its place in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"". Additionally, ""wif"" seems to be independent of its position in the series, always resulting in the same output. Therefore, we can conclude:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or context within the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> blue. The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples. Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" represents the color blue.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word the same number of times as the number of letters in the word 'walm' (which is 4). 

For example, in the first input ""zup bluf wif walm"", 'wif' corresponds to the color red. Following the rule, 'walm' would then mean ""repeat the color red four times,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow red red red red"".

To correct this, here's how you apply the rule:

- ""zup bluf wif walm"": 'wif' is red, hence 'walm' repeats red x4.
- ""zup wif walm lug"": 'wif' is red, hence 'walm' repeats red x4 before 'lug' which is blue.
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"": 'dax' is green, thus the first 'walm' repeats green x4, then 'wif' is red, 'lug' is blue, followed by another 'dax' (green), and another 'walm', which again repeats green x4.
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"": Here, the last color word before 'walm' is 'zup' (yellow), so 'walm' repeates yellow x4.
- ""lug walm"": 'lug' is blue, so 'walm' repeats blue x4.

walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word four times.

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds consistently to the color ""green."" Therefore, the rule can be simply stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that every instance of ""wif"" results in the output ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, it can be deduced that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of the context it is used in. Each instance of ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" whenever it is followed by the word ""wif,"" and to the color ""blue"" when it is followed by any other word or is at the end of a sequence. Here is the rule:

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"" when followed by ""wif,"" and ""blue"" otherwise.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word just before it three times. The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the color tied to the preceding word and triples its occurrence in the output.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the term ""lug"" can be deduced to consistently correspond to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output. The additional terms ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" correlate with other colors: green, red, and yellow respectively.

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" can be deduced by comparing the input and the corresponding output colors. 

In each example, ""dax"" corresponds to the output color ""green"". Notice that the word preceding ""dax"" is not consistent, so ""dax"" itself directly translates to the color ""green"" regardless of the context provided in the examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context within the provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns associated with its occurrences and the subsequent outputs.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to a double ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""zup."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" results in a double red, the meaning does not seem dependent on its position.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and produces a double ""red"" again, reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" means a double appearance of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.
- The fourth example shows ""bluf"" following ""zup"" with the resulting output of another double yellow.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is double ""green.""

Each time, ""bluf"" results in the color corresponding to the word before it being doubled in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present, duplicate the color that corresponds to the preceding word in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here are the associations we can confirm from the given examples:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" which links ""wif"" to the color red.
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" establishing ""lug"" as the word for the color blue.

Additional context from the third and fourth examples helps to verify this pattern by showing the correct repetition even in varied positions within the sequence.

Rule: walm -> When following a color-associated word, it repeats that color's name three times.

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
It appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is used to duplicate the color that comes immediately before it in the sequence. To validate this, let's analyze the examples provided:

- lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
  ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""bluf"", which duplicates the blue. The next color is red, followed by ""lug"" (blue) again and then ""bluf"", which duplicates the blue once more. Finally, ""zup"" is yellow.

- wif bluf lug -> red red blue
  ""wif"" is red, followed by ""bluf"", which duplicates the red. The sequence ends with ""lug"", which is blue.

- zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
  The sequence starts with ""zup"" (yellow), followed by ""lug"" (blue), then ""zup"" (yellow) again. After that, ""bluf"" duplicates the last color mentioned, which is yellow. The last ""lug"" is blue.

- wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
  The sequence is ""red, yellow, bluf (duplicates yellow), blue, blue, blue"". Here, ""walm"" appears to duplicate the color that comes immediately before it (blue), following the pattern of ""bluf"".

- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
  ""dax"" is green, followed by ""zup"" (yellow), then ""bluf"" duplicates the yellow.

Rule:
bluf -> duplicates the immediately preceding color in the sequence
Based on the given examples, we can infer that 'walm' acts as a repeating amplifier for the color that comes before it, duplicating the color word in the output. Here's the reasoning behind that deduction:

- In the first example, 'dax lug dax lug walm' translates to 'green blue green blue blue blue'. After 'walm' appears, the previous color 'blue' is repeated.

- In the second and third examples, 'dax walm wif walm zup' and 'dax walm wif zup', 'walm' comes after 'dax' and 'wif,' and in both cases, the color that comes directly before 'walm' is repeated, 'green green green' and 'red red red' respectively for 'dax walm' and 'wif walm'. 

- The fourth example, 'dax walm wif bluf', further supports this rule as 'bluf' directly follows 'wif' and after 'bluf' we end up with 'red red', which is the color for 'wif', doubled.

- The fifth example, 'wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug', demonstrates the same repeating behavior for 'lug' with 'blue blue blue' after 'walm'. 

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' can be articulated as:

Rule: 'walm' -> Repeat the color word of the preceding term in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". No matter what other words are present or how they are arranged, ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red"". Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color directly before it in the input sequence. Here are the examples broken down:

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
Rule: bluf follows lug and is blue, then it follows zup and is yellow.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Rule: bluf follows zup and is yellow.

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
Rule: bluf follows wif and is red.

Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue
Rule: bluf follows lug and is blue.

Input: zup bluf dax lug
Output: yellow yellow green blue
Rule: bluf follows zup and is yellow.

Bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color word corresponding to the word directly preceding ""bluf"" in the sequence. Rule: If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it means yellow; if it follows ""lug"", it means blue; if it follows ""wif"", it means red; and if it follows ""dax"", it would likewise take the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green), though this sequence is not explicitly shown in the examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the correlation between the inputs and the outputs by examining each example.

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   
2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   
5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
Looking at examples 1, 2, and 5, the input ""lug walm"" consistently results in the output ""blue blue blue"". In this context, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and the addition of ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"" to the output.

Examining example 3, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, it would seem that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" again results in two more ""yellow"" in the output.

Finally, looking at example 4, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". We can see ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". After the presence of ""walm,"" two more ""yellow"" appear in the sequence.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" duplicates the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it two times. 

Rule: walm -> Duplicate the color associated with the previous word two times.

Therefore, ""walm"" takes the color represented by the word before it and repeats it twice in sequence. If ""lug"" represents blue, then ""lug walm"" would yield ""blue blue blue."" Similarly, if ""zup"" represents yellow, then ""zup walm"" would give us ""yellow yellow yellow."" The rule is consistent across all given examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". Regardless of position in the list or surrounding words, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Other words such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" correlate with ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""red,"" respectively. However, ""dax"" maintains its meaning independently. 

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, every instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the word ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should analyze the context in which it is used and the corresponding output in each example. Let's compare the phrases and their outputs:

- ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""
- ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""
- ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""

By looking at each example where ""bluf"" is used, we notice the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or comes at the end of an input, it outputs the same color as the word before it (""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue"" and ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or comes before a word in an input, it outputs the same color as the word after it (""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow"").
- In a longer string, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that comes after it or before it, consistent with the above observations (""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red"" and ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue"").

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word next to it, whether it comes before or after ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding or following it in the sequence.
Based on the supplied examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" affects the subsequent color by repeating it three times. Here is how we can break down the examples to understand this:

Example 1: zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" makes the word ""blue"" appear three times.

Example 2: dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" the word ""green"" is repeated three times, followed by ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

Example 3: zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the word ""red"" to repeat three times, followed by ""lug"" for ""blue.""

Example 4: lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""blue"" three times, then ""zup"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red.""

Example 5: lug dax walm -> blue green green green
""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

From these patterns, we can establish the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: When walm appears in a sequence, it causes the color word immediately preceding it to be output three times in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each example provided.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in all provided examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To find out what ""bluf"" means, we can start by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs and looking for patterns that correlate with the appearances of ""bluf"".

- In every example, wherever ""bluf"" appears, the word ""red"" also appears in the output.
- ""Bluf"" precedes different words in the inputs but consistently translates to ""red"" in the output.
- None of the other words (zup, wif, lug, dax) correlate perfectly with ""red"" in the outputs when ""bluf"" is not in the input.
- Additionally, the color that follows ""red"" in the output differs depending on the word that follows ""bluf"".

This analysis suggests a simple rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the commonalities between the examples provided:

1. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

The translation for ""walm"" appears to be dependent on the word that comes immediately before it. If we analyze the colors that come after the word ""walm,"" we see that they are consistent with the colors translated from the word preceding ""walm.""

Let’s verify this pattern in the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" = green.
2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" = green.
3. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" = red.
4. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" = blue.
5. The first ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" where ""wif"" = red, and the second ""wif walm"" also translates to ""red red red.""

Based on this analysis, it seems that ""walm"" represents a rule where the color of the word preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow
Given the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the context. Across all given examples, we can observe the following:

- In the context of the word ""wif"" before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- In the context of the word ""zup"" before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- The word ""dax"" following ""bluf"" produces the color ""green"".
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", it produces the color ""blue"".

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word before it, except when it is followed by ""lug"", in which case it becomes blue regardless of the previous word, or when it is followed by ""dax"", in which case it always becomes green.

Rule: ""bluf"" results in the color of the word before it unless followed by ""lug"", which makes it blue, or followed by ""dax"", which makes it green.
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" likely means ""blue,"" as it consistently translates to ""blue"" in the given examples whenever it follows the word ""lug."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow,"" and when it follows ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that precedes it.

walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" changes based on the preceding word. If preceded by ""lug,"" then ""walm"" means ""blue."" If preceded by ""zup,"" then ""walm"" means ""yellow."" If preceded by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" then ""walm"" means ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug walm
    ",Output: yellow blue blue red,yellow yellow blue blue blue,False,153
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the word ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the provided input and output pairs, I will analyze the position of the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding output to decipher its meaning or rule.

Here are the observations:

1. When ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""blue red.""
3. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
4. In the sequence ""dax zup wif zup,"" the word ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" as the sequence corresponds to ""green yellow red yellow.""
5. For the sequence ""wif dax wif lug wif,"" we see the use of ""wif"" thrice, and it gets translated into ""red"" every time it is used, regardless of its position or neighboring words.

From these observations, we can determine the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Hence:

wif -> red
Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" does not seem to affect the output, as every instance of ""walm"" is also translated to ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore: 
zup -> yellow
Based on the input-output pairs provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with the output color ""red."" However, when ""bluf"" follows certain words, the color associated with that word is repeated instead. To determine the rule more precisely, let's analyze each pair of input and corresponding output:

1. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs an additional ""red""

2. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and outputs an additional ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   - Same pattern as the first example.

4. wif bluf -> red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs an additional ""red""

5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and outputs an additional ""yellow""

As per these observations, we can deduce the following rule:
When ""bluf"" follows another word, it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated in the output. If there's no word before ""bluf,"" it would output a color corresponding to itself, but this situation has not been demonstrated in the given examples, so we cannot be sure.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Each instance of the input word ""walm"" corresponds to the triplet of the output word ""yellow"". Therefore, I would induce the following rule:

walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, it is replaced with ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: green yellow green blue green,green yellow green blue green,True,154
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided contexts.
Given the examples provided, each word input appears to correspond to a specific color output. The word ""dax"" consistently produces the output ""green"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words. Therefore, based on the information provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is presented in the input, the output features ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that immediately precedes it. Each time ""bluf"" is used, the output is the color that appears before ""bluf"" in the input.

Here are the patterns observed:

1. ""... wif bluf ..."" leads to ""... red red ...""
2. ""... zup bluf ..."" leads to ""... yellow yellow ...""
3. ""... lug bluf ..."" leads to ""... blue blue ...""
4. ""... dax bluf ..."" leads to ""... green green ...""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color word before it and repeats it in the output.

Rule: bluf -> The color word before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.
Observing the provided examples, we witness that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color immediately following it. For instance:

- Every time ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" we see that ""wif"" translates to red on its own but to blue when immediately preceded by ""walm.""
- We note that when ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" its standalone translation to blue does not change.
- We also see that ""zup"" translates to yellow, alone, but red immediately following ""walm.""

The common rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" changes the following word to ""red"" unless the following word is ""lug,"" which remains blue. 

walm -> meaning. Rule: When ""walm"" precedes a word, the output is ""red"" for the following word, except when the following word is ""lug,"" which keeps its original output of ""blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,155
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" represents the color blue.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> color ""yellow""

If we look at the pattern of inputs and outputs provided, it is evident that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" every time it appears. Each instance of the word ""zup"" is translated into ""yellow,"" and additional words correspond to different colors but the word ""zup"" itself consistently means ""yellow.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following associations between the nonce word inputs and the color outputs:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Input: zup bluf wif walm (repeated)
Output: yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"".
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"".
- ""lug"" only appears once and maps to ""blue"".

Now, looking at the outputs associated with ""bluf"":

- In the first, third, and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"".

From this pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Wherever ""bluf"" appears in the sequence, it adopts the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Bluf takes the color of the previous word in the sequence.
Observing the examples given:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

We can notice a pattern where the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with 'green' in the output, while the words ""wif"" and ""zup"" correlate with 'red' and 'yellow' respectively. The word ""lug"" seems to correlate with 'blue' based on the second example.

Looking specifically at the use of ""walm,"" it always results in a sequence of 'green' in the output that corresponds with its position. It seems that ""walm"" doesn't have a single color associated with it but rather repeats the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: For ""walm,"" replicate the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the first word or follows ""dax,"" the color is 'green'.

walm -> Replicate the color of the previous word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: In all examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' represents the color yellow in the given examples.
bluf -> repeated color of the previous word

Rule: When bluf follows a color-indicating word (dax, lug, wif, zup), the output is the color associated with that word repeated twice.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. We can deduce the rule by examining each instance of ""walm"":

1. In ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" The output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" has resulted in repeating the color ""blue.""

2. In ""lug walm zup,"" following ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue."" ""Zup"" is a different color, ""yellow,"" so it isn't repeated — this indicates that ""walm"" is only repeating the color immediately before it.

3. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is again before ""walm"" and translates to ""blue."" Hence, ""walm"" results in ""blue blue.""

4. In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in ""red red,"" repeating the color immediately before it.

5. In ""lug dax walm wif,"" the color before ""walm"" is ""green"" from ""dax,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""green green."" ""Wif"" comes after ""walm"" and is a different color, ""red.""

From these examples, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue blue blue yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,True,157
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Rule: The word ""lug"" means ""blue"", and the word ""zup"" means ""yellow"". The output sequence is the color translation of the input words.
To determine the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look at each instance where it's used and the corresponding output to find a pattern.

1. Input: ""wif dax bluf"" 
   Output: ""red green green""
   
2. Input: ""zup dax bluf""
   Output: ""yellow green green""
   
3. Input: ""dax wif""
   Output: ""green red""
   
4. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""

5. Input: ""dax bluf zup""
   Output: ""green green yellow""

Analyzing the outputs corresponding to the positions where ""dax"" appears in the inputs gives us the following observations:

- ""dax"" always translates into ""green"" regardless of its position. 
- Other words (""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""walm"") appear to translate consistently into their respective colors as well (""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red""). 
- ""dax"" does not seem to be dependent on nearby words, as it always results in ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" There doesn't seem to be any variation in the output linked to the presence of ""wif,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Thus, we can deduce a straightforward meaning for the nonce word ""wif.""

wif -> meaning: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is included in the output sequence at the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, bluf seems to consistently correspond with the color ""blue."" In every case where bluf appeared in the input, the color ""blue"" appeared an equal number of times in the output.

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to an output of the color ""blue,"" repeated as many times as ""bluf"" is repeated in the input.
walm -> repeat the color of the last mentioned color before walm.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is encountered, repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm"". If ""walm"" is repeated without another color word between instances, continue repeating the color associated with the word preceding the first ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup wif
    ",Output: blue green yellow red,blue green yellow red,True,158
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following pattern:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output color is ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" seems to be independent of its position in the sentence.
- The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the same output, regardless of the words that come before or after it.

We can therefore deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Other words, such as ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf,"" correspond to other colors, but since we are only asked to determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we focus only on the pattern associated with this word.

Rule: dax -> ""green""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look closely at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs, paying special attention to the presence of ""bluf"" and the associated output colors.

Let's analyze:

- dax bluf -> green green
- zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
- zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

From these examples, we can observe that the output colors correspond to specific words in the input, and the word ""bluf"" always results in the output color ""yellow"" directly following its occurrence.

In every instance, the occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output. The other words, such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" also have a consistent color associated with them. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

So, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. 

Rule: When the word 'walm' is used, it refers to repeating the color that corresponds to the word just before it in the sequence. For example, if 'walm' follows 'zup,' which corresponds to yellow, 'walm' will also correspond to yellow. If 'walm' follows 'lug,' which corresponds to blue, 'walm' will correspond to blue, and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color every time it is used. The consistent output when ""wif"" is the sole input or is at the beginning of a sequence is ""red."" Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" is consistently associated with the output ""red."" Since the word occurs in sequences with ""wif"" that also outputs ""red"", and considering that all the other words in the sequences map to different colors, we can deduce that ""bluf"" carries the same output regardless of its position in the sequence.

Thus, the rule we can infer is:

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's observe the patterns in each example. Notice that ""walm"" correlates with a specific color being repeated three times in the output. 

In the first example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" relates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to a single ""red."" ""Walm"" seems to cause the red to triple.

In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" results in a single ""green,"" and once again ""walm"" causes the color to triplicate.

Looking at the third pattern, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"" each time, and ""bluf lug"" translates to ""blue."" At the end where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" there are three ""yellow"" in the output, implying ""walm"" tripled the preceding color once again.

The pattern holds in the fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" turning into ""green green green yellow blue green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" here which had produced a single ""green,"" and the output shows three ""green.""

In the final example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red yellow."" ""Walm"" appears twice: once after ""dax"" (producing ""green green green"") and once after ""wif"" (producing ""red red red""). In both cases, it multiplies the preceding single color by three.

Therefore, the rule we can infer for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" makes the preceding color triple in the output.

walm -> triplicate the preceding color in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Following this rule, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes the color green for that specific instance of ""dax"".

Therefore, the meaning is:

dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of position or context of use within the given examples.
zup -> meaning. Rule: zup translates to ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color word that directly precedes it in the input. To confirm this rule, let's observe how ""bluf"" changes in each example with its preceding color word:

- In the first input ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the output is ""blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In the second input ""wif bluf zup"", ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", and the output is ""red red yellow."" ""Bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In the third input ""wif bluf lug zup"", ""wif"" again precedes ""bluf"", and the output is ""red red blue yellow."" ""Bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In the fourth input ""zup dax bluf"", ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", and the output is ""yellow green green."" ""Bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In the fifth input ""zup bluf dax lug"", ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow yellow green blue."" Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the directly preceding word in the input.
Analyzing the given examples, it can be observed that the output sequence always has multiple occurrences of the same color following the word ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be associated with repetition. More specifically, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the nonce word immediately preceding it (""lug,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax"") to repeat until a new nonce word is introduced.

Here is the rule based on the examples provided:

- In the first input ""wif lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""blue.""
- In the second input ""zup walm dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow"" and precedes ""dax"" which is ""green."" The repetition is of ""yellow"" until ""dax"" changes it to green.
- In the third input, ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" leading to repeated ""yellow.""
- In the fourth input ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" again follows ""dax,"" which means ""green"" is repeated.
- In the fifth input, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and hence ""blue"" is repeated until ""dax"" changes it, and it doesn't repeat after the subsequent ""wif"" as there is another ""lug"" immediately after it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat until a new word appears. 

For example:
- ""lug walm"" -> blue repeated
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow repeated
- ""dax walm"" -> green repeated

Applying this rule to each example, we can confirm that the output matches the described pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The nonce word 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue'.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Whenever the input contains the word ""dax"", the output will include ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" It does not appear that the meaning of ""wif"" changes in different contexts within the given examples as it always corresponds to the word ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it can be concluded that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In each example where ""zup"" appears, the output includes the word ""yellow"" at the same position.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Analyzing the examples given, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that precedes it three times. Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes the word ""blue"" to be repeated thrice.
- For ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red,"" implying that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""walm"" causes the preceding color ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- ""Dax lug walm"" gives ""green blue blue blue,"" so ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" thrice.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" as in ""wif walm zup,"" the output is ""red red red,"" and the appearance of a new word ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" but does not affect the rule of ""walm.""
- In ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" still causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times, irrespective of the sequence and the presence of other words that follow it, like ""zup"" and ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input string. Here is the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word is consistently matched to a specific color. By examining the patterns, we can determine that 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green.' When 'dax' is used multiple times, as in the second example, its corresponding output color is also repeated multiple times.

Hence, the induction of the rule from these examples would be:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif translates to the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow"", and each subsequent word denotes a specific color. ""lug"" denotes ""blue"", while ""walm"" signifies multiple ""yellow"" (in this case, three times the word ""yellow""), and ""bluf"" translates to two times the word ""yellow"".
bluf -> repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf"", the output is the color associated with that word repeated twice. For instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green."" Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" hence ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""
Analyzing the given examples where the nonce word ""walm"" has been used, we can try to find patterns in the output that correlate with the presence of ""walm."" Let's break down each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   
In this sequence, the word right before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm,"" we have ""lug wif,"" which translates to ""blue red."" Therefore, ""walm"" may be associated with the transition to ""blue.""

2. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
Again, we see ""walm"" followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" This doesn't give us new information, but it reinforces that ""wif"" follows ""walm.""

3. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   
In this case, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of ""green,"" which is different than the first example where it leads to blue. However, we can note that ""dax"" which correlates to ""green,"" is preceding ""walm.""

4. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   
Here, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence and is followed by three ""red."" This might indicate a repetitive effect when ""walm"" is placed at the end.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
Like in the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), suggesting ""walm"" may be linked to a repetition or continuation of the input before it, which is ""wif"" (red).

Across all examples, it appears that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, sometimes with deviations when contextually necessitated (as seen in Example 1). 

Rule: ""walm"" -> duplicates the color word before it

Let's verify with each example:

1. wif (red) followed by walm results in red red, which fits the rule.
2. zup (yellow) followed by walm results in yellow yellow, fitting the rule.
3. dax (green) followed by walm results in green green green, which fits because it triggers repetition of green.
4. wif (red) followed by walm results in red red red, which fits the rule (the repetition continues possibly due to ""walm"" being at the end).
5. wif (red) followed by walm results in red red, fitting the rule.

Therefore, ""walm"" is most likely a modifier that triggers repetition of the color indicated by the word that comes immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the given examples, it seems like the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Here's the mapping observed:

- dax lug wif -> green blue red
- lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue
- zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green
- dax lug dax lug wif -> green blue green blue red
- dax lug wif -> green blue red

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> green. 

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""yellow"" except when it follows ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" translates to ""green."" Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: 
bluf -> ""yellow"" if it does not follow ""dax""
bluf -> ""green"" if it directly follows ""dax""
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to produce the output ""blue blue blue"" every time it is used. Whenever ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, three consecutive ""blue"" colors are produced in the output. It's also apparent that no other word in the input generates exactly three consecutive ""blue"" outputs.

Here is a breakdown of the examples:

- In Example 1, ""wif dax lug walm"" leads to ""red green blue blue blue"", and we can see that ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""lug"" correspond to ""red"", ""green"", and ""blue"" respectively, while ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"".
- In Example 2, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"", and again, each word corresponds to a single color except for ""walm"", which is followed by three instances of ""yellow"", deviating from the usual color association with ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" but they are not affected since they precede ""walm"".
- Example 3, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"", where ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" once more corresponds to three repetitions of ""blue"".
- Example 4, ""zup wif dax walm"" outputs ""yellow red green green green"", which fits the established one-to-one correspondence for all words but ""walm"", which again triggers three ""green"".
- Finally, Example 5, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" turns into ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"", we see the pattern hold true for individual words and three ""yellow"" colors appear for ""walm"" following the previous ""zup"".

Rule: walm -> meaning. Walm causes a repetition of three instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If it is the first word or if the previous word has no associated color, the default color appears to be blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue 

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns that pertain specifically to the presence of ""dax.""

In every case where ""dax"" is present, the word ""green"" appears in the output. It appears as the first color in the output sequence every time ""dax"" is present in the input. This suggests that ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green.""

Additionally, it seems that ""dax"" might influence the output sequence further based on the context of the other words, but with the current examples, we are only focusing on the word ""dax"" itself.

Based on the above observations, the rule is as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green

This rule applies regardless of the presence of other words in the sequence. Any time ""dax"" appears, you will always see ""green"" in the corresponding position of the output.

wif -> meaning. 

Rule: The word ""wif"" seems to translate to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, it appears that other words map to other specific colors. For instance, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" does not have a single color output but rather a repetition of the color mapped to the word before it followed by ""red"". The colors that the other words map to are consistent across all examples. Therefore, while ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" the other words may translate to a single color or a pattern involving repeat colors and ""red.""

It should be noted that without further examples, it's not completely clear how ""wif"" will behave in conjunction with other words not provided in the examples, but the rule that ""wif"" equals ""red"" appears to be consistent.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word or sequence of words corresponds to a specific color in the output. Considering each input and its corresponding output, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced from the consistent representation in color. Here's the breakdown:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears on its own or as the first word in a sequence, the output is ""yellow"".
- Every subsequent word or combination of words appears to correspond to another color.

For example:

- ""zup"" on its own results in ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif bluf"" makes ""yellow red red"", indicating that ""wif"" is likely ""red"" and ""bluf"" is also ""red"".
- ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"", signifying that ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""bluf"" maintains as ""red"", and ""wif"" is ""red"" when it is at the end of a sequence.
- ""zup lug wif"" becomes ""yellow blue red"", reinforcing that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" at the end is ""red"".

From these examples, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be stated as:

zup -> ""yellow""
Observing the examples provided:

1. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
2. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
3. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
4. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
5. wif bluf -> red red

From these, it's apparent that each occurrence of ""bluf"" leads to a color output. However, the color that ""bluf"" corresponds to seems to depend on the word that immediately precedes it. Let's look more carefully to identify a pattern:

In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red.""
In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""
In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""
In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""
In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is again ""red.""

In examples 3 and 4, ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the word before it, but instead corresponding to the input word's assigned color. This suggests that ""bluf"" reflects the color of the word immediately before it.

From the above observations, we can conclude:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to act as a repetition signal for the color that immediately precedes it. Specifically, the word that comes before ""walm"" is associated with a color, and its output is that color repeated three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- The repetitions of colors in other examples also depend strictly on the word before ""walm"" and its associated color without being affected by other surrounding words.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,165
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce a rule for the meaning of ""dax."" Let's analyze the patterns:

1. When ""dax"" is mentioned once in an input, a single ""green"" appears in the output.
2. When ""dax"" appears at the start of the input sequence, ""green"" is the first word of the output.
3. When ""dax"" is repeated in an input sequence (""dax lug dax""), each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to an output of ""green.""
4. When ""dax"" is surrounded by other words (like in ""dax lug walm"" and ""wif bluf dax""), ""green"" always corresponds to the location of ""dax,"" while the other words seem to have their own color associations.
5. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence doesn't change the output associated with it; it is always ""green,"" irrespective of its position.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words appear to have their own color mappings that are consistent regardless of the presence of ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Every input that contains ""wif"" consistently outputs ""red"" in the same position.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word (dax, lug, wif, bluf, zup) corresponds to a unique color. Here is the mapping as deduced from the inputs and outputs:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Given this mapping, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the examples, let's try to deduce what the rule for ""bluf"" might be.

Analyzing the first example:
Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red
We can see that after ""bluf"" the color ""red"" appears, which corresponds to the word ""wif"".

Analyzing the second example:
Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Here, after ""bluf"" the color ""green"" appears, corresponding to ""dax"".

Analyzing the third example:
Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow
After ""bluf"", we once again have ""red"", which correlates to ""wif"".

Analyzing the fourth example:
Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow
After ""bluf"", ""yellow"" is repeated, corresponding to ""zup"".

Analyzing the last example:
Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
After each ""bluf"" we see that the following colors are green and blue, corresponding to ""dax"" and ""lug"".

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" might correspond to the repetition of the color that comes right after ""bluf"". So, if a word after ""bluf"" corresponds to a certain color, ""bluf"" results in the output being that color again.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word following ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word 'walm', we need to examine the relationships between the inputs and the corresponding outputs in the provided examples.

Let's consider each example:

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   Observation: When the first 'lug' appears, it maps to 'blue', the second 'lug' also maps to 'blue'. 'walm' after 'lug' results in additional 'blue'. 'dax' maps to 'green', and 'wif' maps to 'red'.

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Observation: 'dax' maps to 'green', and following it, 'walm' leads to more 'green'. 'wif' maps to 'red'.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Observation: 'dax' accompanied by 'walm' continues to result in 'green'.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Observation: 'zup' maps to 'yellow', 'lug' maps to 'blue', and the occurrence of 'walm' after 'lug' leads to additional instances of 'blue'. 'wif' appears to reset the pattern, mapping to 'red', and 'walm' following it leads to additional instances of 'red'.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Observation: 'wif' maps to 'red', and 'bluf' does not appear to affect the pattern as it still leads to 'red'. 'dax' maps to 'green', and 'walm' sequentially results in additional 'green'.

Based on these observations, we notice that 'walm' seems to extend the color code of the word that appears right before it. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The nonce word 'walm' repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Let's frame it as per your instructions:

walm -> meaning. Rule: 'walm' causes the color of the preceding word to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,166
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the context or the words that come before or after it.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in each instance where it appears. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning that whenever we see the word ""dax,"" it translates to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word 'wif' corresponds to the color red in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup."" Let's observe the instances where ""zup"" is used and the corresponding output:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""walm"" which outputs ""green,"" the resulting output is a sequence of ""red"" followed by ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" follows ""lug"" which outputs ""blue,"" the resulting output is ""yellow.""
3. When ""zup"" is on its own or follows ""wif"" which outputs ""red,"" the resulting output is ""yellow.""
4. When ""zup"" follows ""dax"" which outputs ""green,"" the resulting output is ""yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""zup"" does not depend on what word it follows to determine its output color. In every case, regardless of the preceding word, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule we can derive is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: Based on the provided examples, every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" means ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correlate with repeating the color of the word that immediately follows it three times. Here's the analysis of each example supporting this rule:

1. **Example 1:**
   Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Analysis: ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in three ""yellow,"" which correspond to ""zup.""

2. **Example 2:**
   Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in three ""yellow,"" which correspond to ""zup.""

3. **Example 3:**
   Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" is directly followed by the end of the input, and results in three ""blue,"" which correspond to ""lug.""

4. **Example 4:**
   Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" is at the end of the input, so it repeats the color of the word that preceded it, ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

5. **Example 5:**
   Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" is at the end of the input, so it repeats the color of the word that preceded it, ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

Given these observations, the rule appears consistent across all examples:

**Rule:**
walm -> meaning. Meaning is that ""walm"" results in three occurrences of the color corresponding to the word that immediately follows it, or, when at the end, the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

**Example application of the rule:**
If the input were ""dax walm zup,"" the output would be ""green green green yellow,"" as ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow."" If ""walm"" were at the end, such as in ""lug dax walm,"" the output would be ""blue green blue blue blue,"" since ""walm"" would result in three occurrences of the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

In each case, regardless of the words preceding or following ""lug,"" the corresponding output for ""lug"" is consistently ""blue."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word dax translates to the color green. Each time dax is used in an input, the word green appears in the corresponding output. Therefore, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
From the given examples, it seems that `wif` is associated with a specific color output each time it appears. Here are the examples that specifically illustrate the meaning of `wif`:

- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
- Input: wif -> Output: red

In all cases where `wif` appears, the output is `red`. There is no variation in this output dependent on context or position, so the rule appears to be constant.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: When bluf follows another word, it takes on the color represented by that word. For example, if ""wif"" represents red, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the context in which the word is used and the output provided.

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

In these first two examples, regardless of the word that follows ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is consistent, indicating that ""walm"" likely maps to a single, consistent color.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

In these examples, ""walm"" always maps to the output ""red"" no matter its position in the input sequence or the surrounding input words. Thus, the rule is not dependent on context.

Given all the examples, the rule for ""walm"" consistently maps to ""red"" in the output. Therefore:

Based on the examples provided, each instance of a word is consistently translated to a specific color in the output. ""Dax"" always translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to ""red."" The word ""wif"" always appears to translate to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
wif -> red
Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: Bluf -> The word ""bluf"" transforms into the color that directly precedes it. If no color precedes it, it repeats the color it represents (red in the given context).
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at what output corresponds to its use in different input sequences. 

In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup dax"" and the output for those three words is ""yellow green green."" Since we see that ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", it would seem that ""dax walm"" correlates to ""green green"".

In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence ""zup walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""

In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the outputs for those two words are ""blue blue,"" which suggests that whenever ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" its output is ""blue.""

The fourth example complicates things a little since ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""lug."" The entire sequence ""zup walm lug"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which may suggest ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again following ""zup."" However, it's important to notice that ""lug"" on its own correlates to ""blue,"" so the sequence of ""walm lug"" might be turning everything into ""yellow.""

The fifth example has ""walm"" following ""wif"" with an output of ""red red,"" suggesting a relationship to ""red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" has a chameleon-like behavior, wherein its output color changes depending on the word that precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it in the sequence.

Rule: The word ""walm"" takes on the output color of the word that directly precedes it.

Example deduction:
Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" thus ""walm"" is ""green.""

Applying the rule to the given examples:

1. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red (""dax"" is green, ""walm"" becomes green)
2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow (""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" becomes yellow)
3. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green (""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" becomes blue)
4. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red (""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" becomes yellow)
5. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red (""wif"" is red, ""walm"" becomes red)

Therefore:

walm -> The word ""walm"" changes its output color to match the color output of the word that directly precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Rules:

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, add the color ""green"" to the output at the corresponding position where ""dax"" appears.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output. In each example, wherever the word ""wif"" appears, the output contains ""red"" in the corresponding position.

Write the rule like this: wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following pattern:

1. In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"". Here, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
2. The second example, ""wif lug zup bluf"", gives us ""red blue yellow yellow"". Again, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"".
3. In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup"", we get ""green green red yellow"". This time, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green"".
4. The fourth example, ""wif bluf"", translates into ""red red"", with ""bluf"" aligning with ""red"" once more.
5. The fifth example, which is the same as the first, reconfirms the initial observation.

Given that ""bluf"" is translating to different colors depending on the context, the rule for ""bluf"" does not seem tied to a specific color. Instead, it appears to mirror the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.
walm -> repeated the color of the word following it three times. Rule: When walm is followed by a word, it causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words that surround it. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Rule: The word ""zup"" seems to add the word ""yellow"" for every occurrence.
Rule: bluf -> green

Each instance of the word ""bluf"" in the examples given correlates to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond with the color ""green"" repeatedly, regardless of its position in input. Every time ""walm"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears three times in the output. Therefore, based on this consistent pattern, the rule can be determined as follows:

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the output that follows each occurrence of ""wif"":

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""wif"" is again followed by ""red.""
3. In the third example, ""wif"" is once more followed by ""red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is once again followed by ""red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is again followed by ""red.""

Across all examples, irrespective of what precedes ""wif,"" it is consistently translated to ""red."" Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
To figure out the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in which ""bluf"" occurs and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
2. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue green blue""
3. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue""
4. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""

From the examples, we can try to infer the patterns:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both words translate to ""green.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and both outputs are ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is the last color word and it repeats the color of the previous color word: ""blue.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" repeats after ""zup"" leading to the color ""yellow"" both times.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is in between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" both of which output ""green""; ""bluf"" also outputs ""green.""

From the above observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: Bluf repeats the color of the word preceding it when translated into colors.

Hence: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf is to repeat the color of the preceding word.
walm -> the preceding color word repeated three times. Rule: When walm follows a color word, the output is the corresponding color word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green."" Other words in the input correspond to different colors; ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that every occurrence of the word ""wif"" results in ""red"" in the output. A simple deduction can be made despite the variations in the surrounding words:

- ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue"".
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"".
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow"".
- ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green"".
- ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" translates to ""blue red red blue red"".

In each case, ""wif"" is consistently associated with the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that comes before it in the sequence. Here's the deduction:

1. In the first example where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the corresponding colors are ""yellow yellow.""
2. In the second example where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" as well, the output remains ""yellow yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which results in ""red red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green.""

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates a sequence of the color that comes directly before it such that the sequence consists of three instances of that color.

Explanation of Rule Deduction Based on Examples:
1. In the first example, ""lug"" translates to the color blue, and ""zup"" translates to yellow. Directly after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" we have ""walm"" and we see the color stated before ""walm"" is repeated three times (blue blue blue and yellow yellow yellow). This pattern also holds as consistent when considering ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""dax"" translates to green and is followed by ""walm,"" after which we see three greens. This supports the rule deduced from the first example. ""wif"" translates to red, but since there's no ""walm"" after ""wif,"" it does not repeat.

3. The third example also complies with the rule, where ""dax"" translates to green and ""zup"" to yellow. ""Walm"" occurs after ""zup,"" and as expected, we see three yellows after it.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to blue, and then ""walm,"" which results in four blues, but since the rule involves the color preceding ""walm"" to be repeated three times, we consider the first blue to be the result of ""lug"" and the following three blues to be the result of ""walm.""

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup"" translates to yellow, which is followed by ""walm"" then ""wif."" Following our rule, ""walm"" makes the previous color (yellow) appear three times. ""Wif"" translates to red independently.

Based on the information above, we can conclude the following:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug translates to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" irrespective of the position or the context within the input sequence. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned, the output includes the color ""green."" Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it seems that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"". Every time the nonce word ""wif"" is input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Note that no other input word consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Additionally, other words seem to have their own colors:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" produces a repeating sequence of ""yellow"".

Using this information, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it's possible to induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in an input, the corresponding output features the color ""yellow"".

Given this pattern, we can infer this rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When ""zup"" is present in an input, translate it to ""yellow"" in the output. Other words in the input correspond to other colors, but ""zup"" consistently means yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

bluf -> red
walm -> meaning. Based on the outputs associated with the use of the word ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" means to repeat the color mentioned just before it two additional times. 

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a color word, that color is repeated two more times in the output.

dax -> green

Rule: The term ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, `wif` appears to correspond to the color red every time it is used. The word ""wif"" itself does not seem to change meaning based on its position or the words around it in the inputs given; its presence consistently results in the output ""red.""

Therefore, the rule can be expressed as:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" should be included in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
walm -> meaning: The meaning of walm seems to be dependent on the word that precedes it. Specifically, the color associated with the previous word is repeated multiple times based on the nonce word ""walm"". Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red"". The word before walm is 'wif' which corresponds to 'red'. After 'walm' there are three 'red' outputs.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". The word before walm is 'zup' which corresponds to 'yellow'. After 'walm' there are three 'yellow' outputs.
- ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green"". The word before walm is 'wif' which corresponds to 'red'. After 'walm' there are three 'red' outputs.
- ""wif lug walm"" corresponds to ""red blue blue blue"". The word before walm is 'lug' which corresponds to 'blue'. After 'walm' there are three 'blue' outputs.
- ""wif walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". The word before the first instance of 'walm' is 'wif' which corresponds to 'red'; after the first 'walm' we have three 'red' outputs. Next, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and after the second 'walm' there are three 'yellow' outputs.

From the examples, it can be inferred that 'walm' prompts the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. However, there is a repeating pattern in which the color following ""lug"" in the output is ""yellow."" The color after ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow,"" and the color after ""walm"" and ""dax"" is consistently ""green."" The presence of ""lug"" does not seem to change the output for subsequent words.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". 

Rule: wif -> red
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"", we'll need to examine the correlation between its position in the input and the color it corresponds to in the output. By analyzing how ""zup"" affects the sequence, we may infer its meaning based on the color pattern it produces.

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the word that immediately follows it (if any) produces an output of yellow.
- The words before ""zup"" (such as ""dax"", ""wif"", ""lug"", ""walm"") are associated with consistent colors in the output (green, red, blue, respectively), regardless of the presence of ""zup"". This suggests that ""zup"" itself likely triggers the yellow output, rather than modifying the meaning of these other words.

Considering these observations, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" directly translates to yellow in the output, while the other words retain their associated colors (green for ""dax"", red for ""wif"", blue for ""lug"", and no pattern identified for ""walm"" based on the given data).

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
From the examples, we can infer that each word corresponds to a color. Specifically, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 

The word ""walm"" appears to always result in the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. This is evident in all provided examples where ""walm"" follows a word that has a known color associated with it, and that color is then repeated once or more times:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated.
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and the output is ""red"" repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and the output is ""red"" repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated.

Thus, it seems the rule is as follows:

walm -> The meaning is that the color corresponding to the previous word is repeated two or more times depending on context. Rule:
- When ""walm"" is used after a word representing a color, the output will repeat the corresponding color of the word preceding the ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by observing its association with particular words in the input and their corresponding outputs.

The common element in each output whenever ""dax"" appears in the input is the word ""green"". Additionally, ""dax"" does not seem to change position relative to other colors when other words are present or their order is changed. This suggests that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"". Here is the breakdown:

- ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green"" (dax corresponds to green)
- ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green"" (dax corresponds to green)
- ""zup dax lug wif dax"" -> ""yellow green blue red green"" (both occurrences of dax correspond to green)
- ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green"" (dax corresponds to green)
- ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue"" (dax corresponds to green, regardless of its position in the sequence)

Hence, the rule is: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each instance it appears.
Based on the provided examples, the consistent rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" This can be inferred from each example given, as every time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the corresponding position in the output.

Thus, the rule can be written as:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, repeated three times.

Let's examine the examples in detail:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and thus ""walm"" causes it to repeat thrice.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" outputs ""red green blue blue blue."" We can see that ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows, causing ""blue"" to be outputted three times.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" produces ""yellow yellow red red red."" This example shows that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" triggers the tripling of ""red.""
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here again, the final word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated thrice.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" gives ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" In the sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is then tripled due to ""walm,"" followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"" and is not affected by ""walm"" since ""walm"" has already executed its repetition rule.

From these examples, we can derive the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> Repeats the color word that comes immediately before it three times. 

Rule: If ""x"" is a color word and it is followed by ""walm,"" the output will be ""x x x.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the input is replaced with the word ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> meaning. The meaning of the word ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to the color green, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".
Rule: wif -> repeat the color of the previous word until a new color is mentioned or the sequence ends.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the examples, there seems to be a pattern related to the word ""bluf"" and the color outputs. Each input word (lug, wif, dax, zup) seems to be associated with a particular color, and the occurrence of the word ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug"" seems to be associated with the color blue, and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (lug wif bluf), the color blue is repeated (blue red red).
- ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color green, and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (dax bluf), the color green is repeated (green green).
- ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color red, and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (wif bluf), the color red is repeated (red red).
- ""zup"" isn't directly followed by ""bluf"" in any examples, but it seems to be associated with the color yellow based on the last example (wif bluf zup).

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to repeat its color output.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> represents a repetition of the color associated with the previous word.
walm -> meaning. Based on the outputs provided, the word 'walm' seems to generate a repetition of the color word that precedes it thrice. 

Rule: When 'walm' follows a color word (e.g., lug for blue, dax for green, zup for yellow), the output repeats that color three times. If multiple colors are mentioned before 'walm', only the immediately preceding color is repeated thrice.

zup -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow every time it's mentioned, regardless of its position in the series of words. 

Rule: zup means yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns and correlations between the ""Input"" sequences and their corresponding ""Output"" colors. Let's examine each instance where ""bluf"" is used and the associated outputs.

1. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
2. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
3. ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue""
4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
5. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> ""green green red yellow green""

A key observation is that the color ""red"" appears immediately after ""bluf"" in the outputs, regardless of the context. Additionally, no other color directly follows ""bluf"" in any given output. Therefore, the most consistent rule we can derive from these examples is that ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the patterns observed in the input-output pairs, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the preceding word's color to be repeated thrice.

Here are the relevant observations which lead to this rule:
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" (examples 1 and 4), the output is ""red red red"". Since ""wif"" alone translates to ""red"", ""walm"" causes the color ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" (example 5), the output is ""blue blue blue"". Similarly, ""lug"" alone translates to ""blue"", and again ""walm"" leads to the color ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" (example 2), the output ends with ""green green green"". As ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green"", this example further supports the repetitive nature of ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule induced for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,180
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue' regardless of context.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Every instance of ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs. Thus, the rule that seems to apply here is that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds with the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the provided examples and the corresponding outputs to identify any patterns.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and since ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax"", ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which also corresponds to ""green"".

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which also corresponds to ""yellow"" in this case. ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red"".

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", followed by ""bluf"", which corresponds to ""yellow"" again. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and the second ""zup"" and ""walm"" again correspond to ""yellow"".

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"". ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", but here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"". Following ""bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Based on the examples above, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word preceding it. It repeats the color output of the word that comes just before it:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

So, the general rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" in the context of the given examples is:

bluf -> meaning: The color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output color does not depend on the position of the word in the input sequence but rather on the word itself. Each word appears to consistently correspond to the same color in the output. Here's the mapping observed:

- The word ""dax"" constantly maps to ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" constantly maps to ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" constantly maps to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" constantly maps to ""red.""

The output colors for each of these words do not change regardless of their position or the presence of the word ""walm."" However, whenever ""walm"" is present, the colors in the output repeat the color corresponding to the word that follows ""walm"" for as many words as there are between ""walm"" and the repeating word, inclusive of ""walm."" For example:

- In ""lug walm dax,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we have ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Hence the output ""blue blue blue green."" There are two instances of ""blue"" following ""walm,"" then the color for ""dax.""
- In ""wif walm dax,"" we get ""red red red green."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the color for ""wif"" to repeat twice more before ending with the color for ""dax"" (green).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: Repeat the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence for as many words as there are from ""walm"" to this next word, itself included.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output corresponding to the following word for the number of words starting with ""walm"" and ending with the word before the repeated color word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to a specific sequence of words/colors in the output. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule: ""lug"" -> ""blue blue blue""

Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, the output consistently contains the sequence ""blue blue blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" and other nonce words used in the examples:

wif -> red
dax -> green
zup -> yellow
lug -> blue
bluf -> blue (given that ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"")

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each instance given in the examples.
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the sequence, it takes the color of the word preceding it.
Based on the examples given, we need to deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""walm."" Let's review the provided inputs and outputs.

1. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
2. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
3. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

Observing the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to infer the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

Let's analyze ""lug walm"" which produces ""blue blue blue"":

Looking at example 1 and example 5:
- ""lug walm"" consistently leads to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may mean ""repeating the previous color output.""

In example 3, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"":
- Following the ""lug walm"" logic, the appearance of ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to repeating ""yellow"" three times.

Now let's consider ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" which creates ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"":
- After ""zup walm,"" we get a triple ""yellow,"" supporting our previous observation. After ""dax zup,"" we note that the pattern doesn't seem to repeat the color (as ""green yellow"" suggests a change), so ""walm"" isn't just about repeating the last color.

Considering ""zup bluf wif walm"" which yields ""yellow yellow red red red"":
- ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" again suggesting the repetition of the previous color.

Based on these observations of ""walm"":

- It is followed by a thrice-repeated color.
- The repeated color is the most recent color before ""walm.""
- ""Walm"" appears to mean repeating the last color said three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""blue"" regardless of the context or position of ""lug"" within the sentence. Hence, the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the Output, regardless of the position in the Input sentence or the words surrounding it.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position within the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, ""zup"" has a direct and unchanging translation to a specific color.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given examples and their respective outputs. 

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   
2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   
3. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   
4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   
5. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

From the examples, we can deduce the following color associations for the other words:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Since ""bluf"" in each case yields a color output that matches the color output immediately preceding it, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it outputs the same color as the word right before it.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: `bluf` repeats the color of the previous word.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- Input: dax walm wif
  Output: green green green red
  Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it repeats ""green."" ""Wif"" then changes the output to ""red"".

- Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
  Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" is still ""blue"", ""dax"" changes to ""green"", ""zup"" changes to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" makes the output repeat ""yellow"". Finally, ""lug"" changes it back to ""blue"".

- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
  Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
  ""Lug"" is ""blue"", ""bluf"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" changes to ""red"", and then ""walm"" follows ""wif"" resulting in repeating ""red"". ""Lug"" changes it back to ""blue"".

- Input: lug walm zup wif
  Output: blue blue blue yellow red
  ""Lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" follows and repeats ""blue"", ""zup"" changes to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" turns it to ""red"".

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" follows ""dax"" repeating ""green"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we'll look at the pattern of its placement and the corresponding outputs.

1. dax lug wif -> green blue red
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. lug dax -> blue green

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is part of the output.
- The position of ""lug"" in the input does not directly correspond to the position of ""blue"" in the output.
- ""lug"" does not always precede or follow the same word, yet ""blue"" appears consistently.

Considering these observations, it seems that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the list of words. Therefore, we can infer that ""lug"" means blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, each input word corresponds to a unique color as an output. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red."" Regardless of its position in the input (beginning, middle, or end), or the presence of other words, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" being part of the output. Here's the inducible rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> yellow when following zup, red when following wif, blue when following lug or when bluf is the second word.
By looking at the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule that defines the word 'walm'. Here are the observations:

1. In every instance of ""walm"" in the input, the corresponding output color is the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

2. Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green green"". Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color ""green"" in this context.

3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output contains consecutive ""blue"" colors. Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" again takes on the color of the word before it.

4. Even when ""walm"" is in the middle of the sequence (as in ""lug walm dax""), it takes the color of the word before it—""blue"" in this case—but doesn't influence the color of the word after it, which retains its own associated color.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word 'walm' replicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Hence:
walm -> meaning. The meaning is that 'walm' causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided where different combinations of the word ""dax"" and other nonce words yield consistent color outputs, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. 

This rule is consistent across all examples given, as every time ""dax"" is mentioned, the output color listed is green.

Therefore:

dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""yellow"". In each given example, when the word ""bluf"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is the corresponding output.
Observing the examples provided, we can determine that each word corresponds to a specific color in the outputs. Here's the list of word-color associations based on the examples:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, we can look at the instances of ""walm"" and note the color that corresponds to its position in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" here is represented by ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red,"" where again ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue,"" indicating ""walm"" is ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow,"" where ""walm"" is ""red.""
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" making ""walm"" ""yellow.""

The examples show a pattern that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- When following ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" is green.
- When following ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" is blue.
- When following ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" is red.
- When following ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" is yellow.

Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be that it adopts the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of ""lug"" corresponds uniformly to the word ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, we can induce a pattern for the word ""bluf"" by comparing the input with its corresponding output.

In each case where the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"". We can also see that other words have consistent colors associated with them in the output:
- ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"",
- ""zup"" is always followed by ""yellow"",
- ""wif"" leads to ""red"",
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue"".

It seems the color output is directly related to the specific nonce word present in the input, without regard to the position of the word within the sequence. Since ""bluf"" consistently results in ""green"" every time it appears, we can induce that ""bluf"" means ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> green
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word(s) the same number of times as there are syllables in the previous word(s).

Explanation:

In each output, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word or words. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of syllables in the prior word(s):

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and because ""wif"" has one syllable, ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

2. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and has one syllable, so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

3. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" with one syllable, so ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""
In this case, ""wif"" is the word that occurs just before ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""red"" and has one syllable, thus ""walm"" results in three ""red""s.

5. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
""Dax lug"" has two words before ""walm"" with one syllable each, resulting in the previous color, ""blue,"" being repeated four times (once for ""dax"" and three times for ""walm"").

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be a command that repeats the color of the previous word, the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of syllables in that word, plus two additional repetitions.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" This is observed by looking at the position of ""dax"" in the input and the corresponding color in the output. For instance, in the first example, ""dax"" is the first word in the input and ""green"" is the first color in the output. 

In every example, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence, it consistently translates to ""green"" in the output sequence:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug wif walm"" and translates to ""green blue red red red"".
- In the second and fourth examples, ""dax"" occurs next to ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspondingly and in both instances, ""green"" follows.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is the last in a sequence before ""lug"" appears again after which ""green blue"" follows.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup lug wif zup"" translating to ""green yellow blue red yellow.""

Therefore, the rule derived from these examples is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word directly translates to a specific color. Here's a breakdown of the words and their corresponding color outputs:

- ""walm"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" in every output

Considering this, and that ""zup"" is always resulting in the color ""yellow"" no matter the position it is used in the sentence, the rule appears to be as follows:

zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word preceding bluf. 

For example, if the word before bluf is 'lug', which in the output is 'blue', the output for bluf is also 'blue'. If the preceding word is 'wif', corresponding to 'red', then bluf also becomes 'red', and so on for other colors.
walm -> green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the input.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The other words ""zup"" and ""walm"" when occurring seem to produce ""yellow"" and ""green green green"" respectively, with their positions also not affecting their output. The word ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""

Rule:
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green green green
- wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" can be derived as follows:

- In the first example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"". The presence of ""wif"" results in the word ""red"".
- In the second example, the input ""wif"" alone translates to ""red"", reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"". Again ""wif"" is at the end and results in ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax wif"" translates to ""red green red"", where both occurrences of ""wif"" result in ""red"".
- In the final example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". Each ""wif"" encountered translates to ""red"" again.

Therefore, regardless of position and surrounding words, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following pattern:

1. ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow.""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
3. ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue.""
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
5. When ""bluf"" appears, the next word (if ""bluf"" is not the last word) is repeated in the translation according to its respective color. If there is no subsequent word, then ""bluf"" takes on the color ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with the first word in the sequence.

For example, in the first input ""zup bluf wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" comes before ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and there's another ""bluf"" at the end, which should be ""yellow"" because it's the last word and there are no more words to repeat.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows: 

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the following word, or if it is the last word, it defaults to ""yellow"".
Rule: walm generates a series of colors, repeating the color that was shown just before walm for three times.

For example:
- In the first input, ""wif walm dax,"" the color before walm is red, and so walm causes red to be outputted three times before resuming with the next color, green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" the color before walm is blue, so blue is repeated three times as a result of walm.

Thus: walm -> repeat the preceding color three times.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

For example:
- In the first input, ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" and the output at that position is ""green.""
- In the second input, ""dax"" appears twice and on both occasions, the output at those positions is ""green.""
- This pattern repeats across all provided examples.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that there is a pattern of color words associated with particular nonce words. Here are the associations from the examples:

- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"" (observed in example 1)
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" (observed in example 1)
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" (observed in examples 2 and 3)
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to multiple ""yellow"" or multiple ""red"" colors (examples 1 and 3 suggest this, but the instances vary in number of repetitions)

The word ""wif"" is consistently present in each input sequence and each time it is associated with the color ""red"". Therefore, regardless of its position or the context provided by other words, ""wif"" consistently leads to the same output color. It doesn't seem to affect the sequence of colors except for introducing its associated color.

So, the rule seems to be:
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each example indicates that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to translate directly to the color ""blue"", regardless of the context. There is no variation whatsoever in the translation of ""bluf"" in the provided examples; it is consistently translated to ""blue"" in every instance. Therefore, the rule is straightforward.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. The number of repetitions is three.

Explanation:

1. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" follows, resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.

2. Input: dax walm zup walm -> Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in ""green"" being repeated three times. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", with ""walm"" following it for a triple ""blue"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", followed by ""walm"", producing a triple ""red"".

4. Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" follows ""wif"", leading to ""red"" being repeated three times.

5. Input: lug dax walm -> Output: blue green green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" follows ""dax"" leading to ""green"" being repeated three times.

Therefore:
walm -> The rule is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True,189
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""lug"" by looking at the corresponding outputs:

Example 1:
- zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow
- zup wif dax -> yellow red green

Example 2:
- lug wif dax -> blue red green
- bluf wif lug -> green red blue

Example 3:
- wif lug dax -> red blue green

Example 4:
- zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Example 5:
- zup lug -> yellow blue

From the examples, it seems that ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

The presence of the word ""dax"" in the input always corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red', no matter its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for the word 'wif' can be deduced as:

wif -> red

Rule: 'wif' represents the color 'red'.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
bluf -> blue

Rule:
Based on the given examples, whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Therefore, the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided. 

- In the first example, the word ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow. The word ""walm"" itself translates to blue.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" corresponding to the color red. ""Walm"" translates to yellow, the same as the preceding word ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" corresponding to blue, with ""walm"" translating to yellow, the same as the preceding word ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" translates to yellow, the same as the preceding word.
- In the last example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and ""walm"" also translates to green, matching the preceding word.

From these observations, we can see a consistent pattern in each example: ""walm"" takes on the color corresponding to the word that is immediately before it. 

Rule: walm -> takes on the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green,green red yellow green,True,190
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, every occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When the input is ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When the input is ""wif dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
- When ""dax"" is combined with other words (e.g., ""wif lug dax"" or ""dax wif walm""), ""dax"" still corresponds to the output ""green."" 

Given that every instance where ""dax"" appears, regardless of what precedes or follows it, the output is ""green,"" we can deduce that:

Rule: dax -> green.
Observing the examples, each time the word ""wif"" is presented in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. The position of ""wif"" within the input does not seem to affect its corresponding output color which is consistently ""red.""

Therefore, the meaning can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: When the nonce word ""wif"" is used in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""zup"" by looking for patterns in the input and their corresponding output:

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: lug zup wif lug
Output: blue yellow red blue

Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

When ""zup"" stands alone, the output is ""yellow"", and every time ""zup"" appears in a sequence, its corresponding output is also ""yellow"". No matter what other words are in sequence with ""zup,"" their presence doesn't seem to alter the output for ""zup"". This pattern suggests that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" irrespective of its position or the context of other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- ""wif dax bluf"" becomes ""red green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) immediately after ""dax,"" while ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue red blue green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) after ""dax,"" while the other words maintain their associated colors (""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red).
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue,"" which implies that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) that comes before it.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
Based on the given examples, each word seems to contribute a certain number of color names to the output sequence, and ""walm"" in particular appears to consistently lead to the output of ""red red red."" To confirm this, let's check each instance where walm is mentioned:

- wif walm -> red red red
- wif walm following dax -> green green green red red red (where ""dax"" appears to contribute three greens)
- lug walm (without ""zup"" or ""wif"" in between) -> blue blue blue red red red
- lug walm following zup and wif -> blue blue blue yellow red red red
- zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

In each case, regardless of what precedes or follows it, ""walm"" produces the sequence ""red red red."" There's no variation in the number of reds produced, and no other color is associated with ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: three repetitions of the word ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug dax wif walm
    ",Output: red blue green red red red,red blue green red red red,True,191
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color blue, irrespective of the position or context within the given examples.
dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a particular color in the output. Each instance of the word ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every input example that includes the word ""zup"" leads to an output where ""yellow"" is present. Additionally, when ""zup"" is presented with other words, the sequence and number of colors change, but ""yellow"" is always included in the output when ""zup"" is in the input:

- ""zup dax wif"" includes ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"" being the first color in the sequence.
- ""lug walm zup"" has ""zup"" as the third word and ""yellow"" as the fourth color in the output sequence.
- ""zup walm"" includes ""zup,"" and the output is three ""yellow""s, indicating that ""zup"" may also dictate the number of colors in the output.
- The single word ""zup"" leads to a single output color ""yellow.""
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" has ""zup"" as the first word and ""yellow"" as the first color in the output sequence, followed by other colors corresponding to the remaining input words.

Despite the variations in the sequences that follow ""zup,"" the presence of ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" being in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to two consecutive colors in the output. However, the colors that ""bluf"" corresponds to are not the same in each example. This suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the context of the other words present.

By inspecting the patterns, one can deduce that ""bluf"" results in the immediate repetition of the color that was output directly before ""bluf"" was mentioned. For instance:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" which corresponds to red, so the output is ""red red"".
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" which outputs blue, resulting in ""blue blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is again preceded by ""wif"", so the output is ""red red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:
Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color that was last output to be repeated once.
To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the provided examples and their outputs.

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

4. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

Now, let's analyze. The word ""walm"" seems to cause repetition in color in the output. When ""walm"" is used, it repeats the color of the preceding word for a specified number of times. For example, in the third input (lug walm), ""lug"" correlates to the color blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue"", repeating the color blue three times. In the fourth input (wif dax lug walm), ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, and results in ""blue blue blue"" again.

However, one tricky part is figuring out why it isn't just a simple repetition of the previous color. If we look at the first input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which correlates to red, but there are three reds in the output, not just two as we would expect if it was just simply repeating the previous color twice.

Let's make the assumption that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the last mentioned color, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words in the input sequence before ""walm,"" excluding ""walm"" itself.

Let's test this hypothesis:

In the first input, there are five words before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" would cause the last color ""red"" to repeat five times, but we see only three reds. Thus, the hypothesis is partially incorrect as it doesn't explain the number of repetitions accurately.

Looking at all the inputs together and the correlated outputs, we can revise our hypothesis to state that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as ""walm"" is positioned in the input. For example, when ""walm"" is the third word, it repeats the color of the previous word three times. If it's the fifth word, it repeats the color of the previous word five times.

Using this revised hypothesis:

1. ""walm"" is the sixth word and repeats ""red"" three times.
2. ""walm"" is the fourth word and repeats ""red"" three times.
3. ""walm"" is the second word and repeats ""blue"" three times.
4. ""walm"" is the fifth word and repeats ""blue"" three times.
5. ""walm"" is the fifth word and repeats ""green"" three times.

There is a consistent pattern in discrepancies: when ""walm"" is supposed to repeat the previous color based on its position (for the sixth, fourth, and fifth positions), we notice that the number of repetitions is always three, regardless of the position of ""walm.""

Given the above analysis, it seems that ""walm"" means to repeat the previous color three times regardless of its position in the sequence. The rule is, therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue,False,192
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" translates to the color blue. The color blue consistently follows the appearance of the word ""lug"" in the inputs, and the outputs consistently contain the color blue corresponding to each occurrence of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green."" In every output, the occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to the color green being mentioned. The order of the colors also matches the order of the words in the input, suggesting that the first word determines the first color mentioned in the output, and the second word determines the second color (if applicable).

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" is a rule-dependent word that signals the end of a sequence and prompts the application of a color to each element in the sequence that precedes ""wif"". Each unique word has a corresponding color, as seen in the examples. When ""wif"" appears, it signals the translation of the words into their respective colors, followed by the addition of ""red"" to the sequence of colors.

The meaning can be outlined with the following associations between words and colors:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green

And ""wif"" behaves as follows:

wif -> Ends the sequence and a ""red"" is added to the output list of colors.

Rule:
- For every unique word before ""wif,"" translate it to its corresponding color.
- After translating all words before ""wif,"" add ""red"" to the sequence of colors.

Therefore:

wif -> Translates preceding words into colors and adds ""red"" at the end of the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples.
Rule: bluf -> the color word that matches the color word before it. If no color word precedes it, bluf has no assigned color.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word, repeated three times. The examples show a word that corresponds to a color followed by ""walm,"" and the output is that color repeated three times. Here are the mappings as observed:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Considering these, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times. 

For instance:
- ""dax lug walm"" is translated as ""green blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" means to repeat blue three times. 
- ""zup walm dax"" shows that ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three repetitions of the color yellow, which is associated with ""zup,"" followed by green for ""dax.""
- ""dax walm wif walm"" gives us two repetitions of the three-color rule, first repeating green for ""dax"" and then repeating red for ""wif."" 

Thus:
walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax walm wif bluf"" gives the output ""green green green red red."" Here, 'dax' precedes 'walm' and 'wif,' which associate respectively with 'green' and 'red.' 'Bluf' at the end also correlates with red.

- ""zup bluf dax"" yields ""yellow yellow green,"" where 'zup' and 'bluf' come before 'dax.' Here, 'bluf' has been previously associated with red but now is yellow, suggesting that the meaning of 'dax' is not influenced by 'bluf's' color. 'Dax' is the last word and corresponds to green.

- ""lug dax"" produces ""blue green,"" with 'lug' corresponding to blue and 'dax' to green.

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" reinforcing that 'dax' corresponds to green and appears to maintain that meaning regardless of the following word.

- ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue."" Here, 'dax' comes after 'wif' and 'bluf,' both are red, yet still, 'dax' is green, followed by 'lug,' which is blue.

Rule: dax -> green

The consistent output across all examples when 'dax' is present is the color green, regardless of the other words in the sequence.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" The other words appear to correspond to different colors as well. Here is the breakdown:

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- Direct substitution: zup -> yellow

Input: zup wif zup
Output: yellow red yellow
- The pattern suggests: zup -> yellow, wif -> red

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- This example shows: zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow (possibly meaning the same color as the word before it), dax -> green

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- Once again: zup -> yellow, wif -> red, bluf -> red (which changed from the previous example, suggesting an error in the provided translations, or that there might be some contextual rule we do not have enough examples to figure out), lug -> blue

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow
- Here it's shown: lug -> blue, bluf -> blue (once more implying the color before it), zup -> yellow

Based on the instances provided only, if we disregard the inconsistency surrounding ""bluf"" and assume it was an error in example three, the simplest rule for ""zup"" can be established as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the previous color mentioned. If we examine each example:

1. lug bluf dax bluf - blue blue green green
2. zup bluf dax lug - yellow yellow green blue
3. zup bluf wif walm - yellow yellow red red red
4. dax bluf - green green
5. zup wif bluf zup - yellow red red yellow

In each instance, ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of the color just before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the previous color mentioned.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will compare the input and output pairs to identify a pattern.

Input: zup wif walm Output: yellow red red red
Input: dax walm wif Output: green green green red
Input: wif walm dax zup Output: red red red green yellow
Input: dax lug wif walm Output: green blue red red red
Input: wif walm Output: red red red

From these examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to three reds in the output, regardless of its position in the input. Another observation is that the other words correspond to a single color in the output: ""wif"" consistently corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue.

Rule: Regardless of position, ""walm"" corresponds to three consecutive reds in the output.

walm -> meaning: red red red

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: ""blue""

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output across all examples.
Based on the provided input and output examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears on its own, the output is ""green.""
- Regardless of its position in the input sequence, the presence of ""dax"" consistently results in the word ""green"" in the output sequence.

Therefore:

dax -> ""green""

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, as every instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output. Other words seem to correspond to different colors:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> blue
- zup -> yellow

With this pattern, we can induce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Each of the given inputs that contains the word ""zup"" results in an output that includes the word ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: If the previous word translates to a color, repeat that color for ""bluf"". For example, if ""lug"" means ""blue"", then ""lug bluf"" means ""blue blue"". If ""dax"" means ""green"", then ""dax bluf"" means ""green green"".
Based on the provided examples, a pattern emerges where the output colors correspond to the input words. The sequence of outputs for ""wif bluf dax walm"" is consistent with the ""wif bluf dax walm lug"" example, with the exception of the last color, which corresponds to the new word ""lug.""

By examining the outputs corresponding to the known inputs and the nonce word ""walm,"" we can discern that ""walm"" is consistently translated to two outputs of the color green. Moreover, the color does not change dependent on the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence, as seen in the last two examples where its position changes.

Hence, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to two instances of the color green, regardless of its location in the input sequence.

So, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is:

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to two green colors in the output sequence.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

Every time the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Every instance where the nonce word ""wif"" is used in the input, it corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> the color word that corresponds to the color word that precedes it

Rule: When bluf follows a color word, it takes on the color that the color word represents. For instance, when bluf follows ""lug,"" it means ""blue,"" and when bluf follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow."" It effectively duplicates the color word that comes before it.
Given the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color ""yellow"" three times in the output. Here are the observations from the input and output relations that support this conclusion:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the output always ends with ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- Regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input, the pattern remains unchanged; it doesn't matter what precedes it.
- The other words in the input correspond to different single color outputs: ""lug"" results in ""blue"", ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", ""wif"" results in ""red"", and ""dax"" results in ""green"". These words result in the output of one instance of their corresponding color, while ""walm"" is always followed by ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" in the input correlates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output.

Based on these observations, we can say:

walm -> meaning: The term ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the word ""yellow"" three times in the output.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding context.
Based on the examples provided and the consistent appearance of ""dax"" followed by certain colors, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".
Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to consistently elicit the output ""yellow"". Additionally, it can be noted that other words in the input correspond to other specific colors irrespective of their position. The word ""wif"" results in ""red"", ""dax"" results in ""green"", and ""lug"" results in ""blue"". The repeated occurrence of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repetition of the color ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be deduced as:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color that precedes it in a sequence. To verify this rule, we look at each example:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which also outputs ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""zup bluf dax"" maps to ""yellow yellow green"", again ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word, which is ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which outputs ""blue"".

The second and fourth examples also support this rule, but they include an additional color word after ""bluf"", which remains consistent with its regular mapping.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the color word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the color word immediately before it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, each word appears to translate to a specific color, and the repetition of colors in the output hints at a pattern connected to the number of times a given word occurs. Here's what we can infer from each example:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""bluf"" results in another ""red""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""walm"" results in two additional occurrences of ""green""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""dax"" is ""green""
- ""wif"" is ""red""
- The occurrence of ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax"", resulting in an additional ""red""
- ""lug"" is ""blue""
- ""zup"" is ""yellow""

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" is ""red""
- The first ""walm"" leads to an additional ""red""
- ""zup"" is ""yellow""
- ""lug"" is ""blue""
- The second ""zup"" is ""yellow""
- The second ""walm"" follows two instances of ""zup"", leading to two additional occurrences of ""yellow""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" is ""yellow""
- ""wif"" is ""red""
- The following ""walm"" leads to two additional ""red""

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- ""wif"" is ""red""
- ""lug"" is ""blue""
- ""dax"" is ""green""
- The ""walm"" follows a ""dax"" and produces two additional ""green""

From these examples, it appears that the rule for ""walm"" is dependent on the identity of the word that precedes it. ""Walm"" seems to duplicate the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it two more times. Thus, we can draft the rule as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> duplicates the color of the preceding word two additional times.

So, if the preceding word results in the color ""red,"" ""walm"" results in ""red red."" If the preceding word is ""green,"" ""walm"" leads to ""green green,"" and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" in this context as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. The color associated with ""dax"" is consistently green, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the other words around it.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the term ""red"" is present in the output corresponding to the position of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

So the meaning of zup can be assumed to be the color yellow, as every time the word zup appears in the input, the color yellow appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: zup means yellow.
bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Given the examples:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

We can observe that the output color corresponding to the word ""walm"" repetitively matches the color preceding it. ""Walm"" does not seem to have a color of its own, but rather continues the sequence of colors stated before it. This can be further supported by the fact that regardless of whether ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax,"" which correspond to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively, the color mentioned after ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue. Rule: Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of what other words are present or their order. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". 

Evidence:
- In all provided examples, each occurrence of the word ""wif"" results in the color ""red"" in the output.
- No matter the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence, the output consistently includes ""red"" in the corresponding position.

Therefore, wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""yellow"". This suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"".
Rule: The word that follows ""bluf"" determines its color meaning. If ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow."" When ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" means ""red."" If ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green."" If ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" it is not immediately clear what color ""bluf"" would represent because there is no direct example, but it is likely to follow the pattern and translate to a color corresponding to ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Thus, we can roughly summarize the rule as:
bluf -> The color of the word that immediately follows bluf.
Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition of a color word three times in the output. The specific color repeated is determined by the word that precedes ""walm"":

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" so ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

When ""walm"" is used after a color-indicating word, the output is three repetitions of the color associated with that word.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.
